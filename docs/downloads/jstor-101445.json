  "text": "tians, were invited to look upon an ox, that had for two or three days almost continually held his Neck straight up, and was dead of a Disease, the Owner could not conjecture at; whereupon, the parts belonging to the Neck and Throat, being open'd, they found, to their wonder, the Aspera Arteria in its very Trunk all stuff'd with Grass, as if it had been thrust there by main force: which gives a just cause of marvelling and inquiring, both how such a quantity of Grass should get in there; and how, being there, such an Animal could live with it so long.\n\nOf a place in England, where, without petrifying Water, Wood is turned into Stone.\n\nThe same Searcher of Nature, that was alledged in the immediately precedent Observations, did impart also the following, in another Letter from Oxford, where he saith:\n\nI was a while since visited by a Gentleman, who tells me, That he met with a Place in these parts of England, where, though there be no petrefying Springs (for that I particularly asked) Wood is turned into Stone in the Sandy Earth it self, after a better manner then by any Water I have yet seen: For I had the Curiosity to go to look upon pieces of Wood, he brought thence, and hope for the opportunity of making some tryals to examine the matter a little further, then I have yet been able to do. Thus far that Letter.\n\nSince which time, He was pleased to give this further Information of the same matter, with a Manifessa of some other Particulars, belonging to this Subject, in these Words.\n\nI was lately making some Tryals with the petrified Wood I told you off, which I finde to be a very odd substance, wonderfully hard and fixed: If I had opportunity to Re-print the History of Fluidity and Firmness, I could adde divers things about Stones, that perhaps would not be disliked; and I hope, if God vouchsafe me a little leisure,\nto insert several of them in fit places of that History, against\nthe next Edition. Here is a certain Stone, that is thought\nto be petrefyed Bone, being shap'd like a Bone, with the\nMarrow taken out; but with a fit Menstruum, I found that\nI could easily dissolve it, like other soft Stones: and possi-\nbly it may prove as fit as Osteocolla, for the same Medicinal\nUses.\n\nOf the nature of a certain Stone, found in the In-\ndies, in the head of a Serpent.\n\nThere was, some while ago, sent by Sir Phileberto Vernatti\nfrom Java major, where he resides, to Sir Robert Moray, for\nthe Repository of the Royal Society, a certain Stone, affirm-\ned by the Presenter to be found in the Head of a Snake,\nwhich laid upon any Wound, made by any venomous Cre-\nature, is said to stick to it, and so draws away all Poison:\nand then, being put in Milk, to void its Poison therein, and\nto make the Milk turn blew; in which manner it must be\nused, till the Wound be cleansed.\n\nThe like Relations having been made, by several others,\nof such a Stone, and some also in this City affirming, to have\nmade the Experiment with success, it was thought worth\nwhile, to inquire further into the truth of this Matter: since\nwhich time, nothing hath been met with but an Informa-\ntion delivered by that Ingenious Parisian, Monsieur Thevenot,\nin his second Tome, of the Relations of divers considerable\nVoyages, whereof he lately presented some Exemplars to his\nFriends in England. The Book being in French, and not\ncommon, 'tis conceived it will not be amiss to insert here\nthe said Information, which is to this effect:\n\nIn the East Indies, and in the Kingdom of Quamsy in China,\nthere is found a Stone in the Head of certain Serpents (which\nthey call by a name signifying Hairy Serpents) which heals the\nbitings of the same Serpent, that else would kill in 24 hours.\nThis Stone is round, white in the middle, and about the edges",
