  "text": "to be touched, though he died with near 40 Ulcers upon him.\n\nDear SIR,\n\nPlymouth,\nOct. 16 1739.\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\nJohn Huxham.\n\nIn another Letter dated at Plymouth, Nov. 30. 1739. Dr. Huxham says, \"We have had a very tempestuous Season for several Days past, though now fair; the Mercury lower [28.1 Inches] than I have known it for some Years, and the Tides excessively high.\"\n\nIII. An Account of Coal-balls made at Liege, by William Hanbury, Esq; F. R. S.\n\nIn pursuance of the Orders of the Society, I shall endeavour to give an Account of the factious Coal made at Liege. But first I shall quote Two Authors, who mention it in their Accounts of the Town of Liege.\n\nThe First is, Le Curieux Antiquaire, ou Recueil geographique & historique, par le Sr P. L. Berkenmeyer à Leide 1729. p. 182. Where he says, \"This Bishoprick (Liege) has rich Mines of Houille or Stone-coal*, which the Inhabitants sell in the Ne-\n\n* The common People call their Pit-coal, del Hey or de la Houille; and the Mixture of Coal and Clay de Houchy. C. M.\n\ntherlands,\n\"therlands, and by the Sale of it they get above\n100,000 Ducats per Annum.\"\n\n\"This Coal lights easily, and gives a great Heat:\nIt is not therefore to be wondered, that Fire is\nreckoned amongst other Advantages the Liegeois\nboast of: They say, they have the best Bread, the\nhardest Iron, and the hottest Fire: By this last they\nmean, de la bouille, which, being once well\nlighted, casts the greater Heat, if it be wetted with\nWater.\"\n\nThe Second Book I shall mention is, Les Delices\ndes Pais Bas, Vol. III. p. 243. where I find that this\nTown Liege is said to be \"the Hell of Women,\nbecause they are obliged to work more here than\nin any other Country. They draw the Boats, and\ncarry on their Backs, like Slaves, les boilles, and\nother Things; and these Women are called des\nBotresses.\"\n\nIn the Year 1628. by a printed Paper produced be-\nfore you, it appears, that this Fuel was known in\nEngland at that Time; and if you will believe the\nAuthor of that Paper, it was discovered by Hugh\nPlat in 1594.\n\nThere is an Account of it printed in the Essays for\nthe Month of December 1716. where it is proposed\nto be made with the black Ouse of the Thames, and\nfor Four Pence per Bushel.\n\nI have used this Coal and Clay mixed upwards of\nTen Years, and by Experience I find it to answer\nvery well. It is a most excellent Fire for Roasting, for\nheating of Irons, or warming a Room: I use it in\nmy Kitchen, Laundry, Parlour, and Library.\nThe Method in which it is made at Liege, where I first saw it, and made some myself, is as follows:\n\nTake $\\frac{1}{3}$ of unctuous Clay, (such as Brewers use to bong their Vessels, in it there must be neither Sand, Gravel, or Stone)\n\nAnd $\\frac{2}{3}$ of Coal-dust: Mix, and make them incorporate well together; cast them into round Balls, or Bricks; and you may put them on a Coal-fire, and they will burn directly. But if they are made in Summer-time, and laid to dry for Use in Winter, they will light sooner.\n\nThus you have an hot, clean, lasting Fire, not at all offensive to the Smell.\n\nThe Dust is there the Refuse of the Mine, and may be here of the Coal-merchant's Yard, so that this Fuel comes exceeding cheap.\n\nNor is it necessary to put so much Coal-dust; for some Clay (particularly what I use myself in the Country) will do, if mixed $\\frac{2}{3}$ Clay, $\\frac{1}{3}$ Coal-dust; and the true Proportion of the Mixture must be found by Experience; but it is always better to put in too much than too little Coal-dust at first, because Men are too apt to be discouraged in making Experiments.\n\nThis Fuel is not only to be had at an easier Price, but it is likewise more durable.\n\nHow far it may be useful in Glass-houses, Brewhouses, Salt-works, &c. I must leave to the Consideration of the several Persons concerned in them.\n\nI have heard, that at Liege they burn both Lime and Brick with it; but, as I never saw it done, I cannot affirm it.",
