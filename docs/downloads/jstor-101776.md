IV. A New Treatise of CHYMISTRY, &c. written in French by Christopher Glaser, and now faithfully Englished by F. R. S. London, 1677. in 8°.

This Author having reflected upon the causes, why many have declaimed against Chymical Writers and even against Chymistry itself, maketh it his business in this Treatise to publish a short and easy method for the happy attainment of all the most necessary preparations of Chymistry; assuring us, that the considering Reader shall find therein nothing tedious, superfluous, or defective in any matter that deserves to be known, and that, though indeed the Preparations of all Chemical matters cannot be found therein, yet sufficient Examples of them will be had from it; affirming withal, that he hath deliver'd no operation, but what he has made and well experienced himself, and what any one, following the Rules by him prescribed, may do after him.

As for the Theory, he speaks succinctly, yet seems to say so much of it as may suffice for direction to the Preparations: performing his operations on Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals, and proceeding therein orderly, without omitting any necessary directions.
