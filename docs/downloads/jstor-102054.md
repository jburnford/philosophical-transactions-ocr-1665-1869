10th, is to shew the easiness there is in reducing other Fortifications (provided they have second flans) to this manner, without altering the Face of the Bastion, the Motes, or the Outworks. The 11th, is the Plane of the City of Dunkirk, with the Antient Fortifications, upon which are placed also the new ones (of the Author) that both Methods may be the better compared together.
