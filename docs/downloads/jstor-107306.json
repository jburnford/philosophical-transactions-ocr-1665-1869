P.\n\nRead November 14, 1811.\n\nIn this discourse I propose to investigate the attractions of a very extensive class of spheroids, of which the general description is, that they have their radii expressed by rational and integral functions of three rectangular co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere. Such spheroids may be characterized more precisely in the following manner: conceive a sphere of which the radius is unit, and three planes intersecting one another at right angles in the centre; from any point in the surface of the sphere draw three perpendicular co-ordinates to the fixed planes, and through the same point in the surface likewise draw a right line from the centre, and cut off from that line a part equal to any rational and integral function of the three co-ordinates: then will the extremity of the part so cut off be a point in the surface of a spheroid of the kind alluded to; and all the points in the same surface will be determined by making the like construction for every point in the surface of the sphere. The term of a rational and integral function is not to be strictly confined here to such functions only as consist of a finite number of terms; it may\ninclude infinite serieses, provided they are converging ones; and it may even be extended to any algebraic expressions that can be expanded into such serieses. This class of spheroids comprehends the sphere, the ellipsoid, both sorts of elliptical spheroids of revolution, and an infinite number of other figures, as well such as can be described by the revolving of curves about their axes, as others which cannot be so generated.\n\nIn the second chapter of the third book of the Mécanique Céleste, Laplace has treated of the attractions of spheroids of every kind; and in particular he has given a very ingenious method for computing the attractive forces of that class which in their figures approach nearly to spheres. In studying that work, I discovered that the learned author had fallen into an error in the proof of his fundamental theorem; in consequence of which he has represented his method as applicable to all spheroids whatever, provided they do not differ much from spheres; whereas in truth, when the error of calculation is corrected, and the demonstration made rigorous, his analysis is confined exclusively to that particular kind, described above, which it is proposed to make the subject of this discourse. I have already treated of this matter in a separate paper, in which I have pointed out the source of Laplace's mistake, and likewise have strictly demonstrated his method for the instances that properly fall within its scope. In farther considering the same subject, it occurred to me that the investigation in the second chapter of the third book of the Mécanique Céleste, however skilfully and ingeniously conceived, is nevertheless indirect, and is besides liable to another objection of\nstill greater weight; it does not exhibit the several terms of the series for the attractive force in separate and independent expressions: it only points out in what manner they may be derived successively, one after another; in so much that the terms of the series near the beginning cannot be found without previously computing all the rest. This remark gave occasion to the following paper, in which it is my design to give a solution of the problem which is not chargeable with the imperfections just mentioned: the analysis is direct, and every term of the series for the attractive force is deduced immediately from the radius of the spheroid. As the ellipsoid, which comprehends both sorts of elliptical spheroids of revolution, falls within the class of figures here treated of, I have derived, as a corollary from my investigation, the formulas for the attractions of that figure which are required in the theory of the earth: this paper therefore will contain all that is useful on the subject of the attractions of spheroids, as far as our knowledge at present extends, deduced by one uniform mode of analysis.\n\nHaving mentioned the principal object of this discourse, I must likewise notice a subordinate purpose I have in view; it is to put in a clear light the real grounds of Laplace's method, and of the equivalent method delivered in the following pages; to the accomplishment of which nothing is likely to contribute so much, as a direct and rigorous analysis perspicuously conducted. To promote the same end still farther, by preserving greater order and perspicuity in treating a subject in its own nature very complicated, this paper will be divided into two principal sections: in the first section it is proposed\nto lay down the analytical propositions on which the investigation is founded: the second section will contain the solution of the problem under consideration.\n\nOne more preliminary observation it is proper to add. The problem of attractions contains two cases; when the density of the attracting body is uniform throughout; when it varies according to any given law: it is in the first of these two cases that the chief difficulties occur; and as I have nothing new to add on the second case, I shall here confine my attention to homogeneous spheroids, unit being supposed to denote the density.\n\nI.\n\nPreliminary Investigations.\n\n1. Let $\\mu$ denote the cosine of an angle, and let\n\n$$f = \\left\\{ r^2 - 2ra \\cdot \\mu + a^2 \\right\\}^{3/2};$$\n\nthen the truth of the following equation in partial fluxions will be proved merely by performing the operations indicated, viz.\n\n$$(1 - \\mu^2)^n \\cdot \\left( \\frac{d}{dr} \\cdot \\frac{a - r\\mu}{f^{2n+3}} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\cdot \\frac{(1 - \\mu^2)^{n+1}}{f^{2n+3}} \\right) = 0.$$\n\nNow put $S = \\frac{1}{f^{2n+1}}$; then\n\n$$\\frac{dS}{da} = -(2n + 1) \\cdot \\frac{a - r\\mu}{f^{2n+3}}$$\n\n$$\\frac{1}{ra} \\cdot \\frac{dS}{d\\mu} = 2n + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{f^{2n+3}}$$\n\ntherefore, on account of the first equation, we shall obtain by substitution,\n\nMDCCCXII.\nMr. Ivory on the Attractions of an\n\n\\[ ra \\cdot (1 - \\mu^*)^n \\cdot \\left( \\frac{dS}{dad} \\right) + \\left\\{ d \\cdot \\left[ (1 - \\mu^*)^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{dS}{d\\mu} \\right] \\right\\} = 0. \\]\n\n2. Let \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) be reduced into a series of the descending powers of \\( r \\); then\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{f} = C^{(0)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} + C^{(1)} \\cdot \\frac{a}{r^2} + C^{(2)} \\cdot \\frac{a^2}{r^3} + \\ldots + C^{(i)} \\cdot \\frac{a^i}{r^{i+1}}, \\text{ &c.} \\]\n\nand \\( C^{(i)} \\) will be a rational and integral function of \\( \\mu \\) of \\( i \\) dimensions: substitute this series for \\( S \\) in the equation last found (\\( n \\) being \\( = 0 \\)), and we shall obtain\n\n\\[ i(i+1)C^{(i)} + \\frac{d \\cdot \\left[ (1 - \\mu^*) \\cdot \\frac{dC^{(i)}}{d\\mu} \\right]}{d\\mu} = 0 \\ldots \\ldots (1). \\]\n\nAgain, take the fluxions \\( n \\) times successively in \\( \\frac{1}{f} \\) and likewise in the series equivalent to it, making \\( \\mu \\) the only variable; and we shall get\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{f^{2n+1}} = \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\ldots 2n-1} \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{r^{2n+1}} \\cdot \\frac{d^nC(n)}{d\\mu} + \\frac{a}{r^{2n+2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^nC(n+1)}{d\\mu^n} + \\ldots \\ldots \\right. \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{a^{i-n}}{r^{i+n+1}} \\cdot \\frac{d^nC^{(i)}}{d\\mu^n}, \\text{ &c.} \\right\\}: \\]\n\nsubstitute this series for \\( S \\) in the equation of No. 1, and we shall get\n\n\\[ (i-n)(i+n+1) \\cdot (1 - \\mu^*)^n \\cdot \\frac{d^nC^{(i)}}{d\\mu^n} + \\frac{d \\cdot \\left[ (1 - \\mu^*)^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{d^{n+1}C^{(i)}}{d\\mu^{n+1}} \\right]}{d\\mu} = 0 \\ldots \\ldots (2). \\]\n\nFrom this last equation it follows that\n\n\\[ \\int (1 - \\mu^*)^n \\cdot \\frac{d^nC^{(i)}}{d\\mu^n} \\cdot d\\mu = 0 \\]\n\nwhen the fluent is taken between the limits \\( \\mu = -1 \\) and\nμ = 1: for the fluent in question is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{i-n \\cdot i+n+1} \\cdot (1-\\mu^s)^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{d^{n+1}C(i)}{d\\mu^{n+1}} \\), a quantity which is evanescent at both the limits.\n\nIf we consider \\( \\frac{d^0C(i)}{d\\mu^0} \\) as a symbolical representation of \\( C(i) \\), the equation (1) will be included in the equation (2); whence it is easy to infer that whatever is proved of \\( \\frac{d^nC(i)}{d\\mu^n} \\) by the help of the equation (2) may be transferred to \\( C(i) \\) by putting \\( n = 0 \\); a remark that will enable us to consult brevity, and of which we shall freely avail ourselves.\n\n3.

Instead of seeking immediately the attraction of a spheroid in any proposed direction, it will be more advantageous to investigate (as Laplace has done) the value of the expression (to be henceforth denoted by V) which is the sum of the quotients produced by dividing all the molecules of the mass of the spheroid by their respective distances from the attracted point. For such is the nature of the analytical expression now mentioned, that if it be first transformed into a function of three rectangular co-ordinates one of which is parallel to a line given by position, and the fluxion with regard to this co-ordinate be taken; the coefficient of the partial fluxion after its sign is changed, will denote the attractive force which acts parallel to the given line. In order to demonstrate this property of the function V, we shall suppose that \\(x, y, z\\) denote the co-ordinates of the molecule \\(dM\\), and \\(a, b, c\\), the co-ordinates of the attracted point: then\n\n\\[ V = \\int \\frac{dM}{\\left\\{(a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2 + (c-z)^2\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{2}}}; \\]\n\nthe fluent being understood to be extended to all the molecules of the mass of the spheroid: now if the fluxion of this\nexpression be taken, making \\(a\\) the only variable, we shall have\n\n\\[- \\left( \\frac{dV}{da} \\right) = \\int \\frac{(a-x) \\cdot dM}{\\left\\{ (a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2 + (c-z)^2 \\right\\}^{3/2}}:\\]\n\nwhere the expression on the right hand side is the attractive force parallel to \\(a\\), as will readily appear by decomposing the direct attractions of all the molecules into the partial attractions parallel to the co-ordinates. But, besides enabling us to find the attractive force in any proposed direction, the function \\(V\\) has another advantage; for it is this function, and not the expressions of the attractive forces, which enters into the equation of the surface of a body, wholly or partly fluid, in a state of equilibrium.*\n\nThe expression for \\(V\\), exhibited above is not of a commodious form, and on this account it becomes necessary to transform it. Let \\(x = R' \\cos. \\theta'\\); \\(y = R' \\sin. \\theta' \\cos. \\varphi'\\); and \\(z = R' \\sin. \\theta' \\sin. \\varphi'\\); then will \\(R'\\) be the line drawn from the molecule \\(dM\\) to the origin of the co-ordinates; \\(\\theta'\\) will be the angle which \\(R'\\) makes with the axis of \\(x\\); and \\(\\varphi'\\) the angle which the projection of \\(R'\\) upon the plane to which \\(x\\) is perpendicular, makes with a line given by position in the same plane: from the assumed values of \\(x, y, z\\), it is easy to derive these new values, viz.\n\n\\[x = R' \\cos. \\theta' = \\sqrt{R'^2 - y^2 - z^2}\\]\n\\[y = R' \\sin. \\theta' \\cos. \\varphi' = \\sqrt{R'^2 \\sin. \\theta'^2 - z^2}\\]\n\\[z = R' \\sin. \\theta' \\sin. \\varphi':\\]\n\nand, by taking the fluxions so as to make \\(x\\) vary with \\(R'\\), \\(y\\) with \\(\\theta'\\), and \\(z\\) with \\(\\varphi'\\); which will leave \\(dx, dy, dz\\), as well as \\(dR', d\\theta', d\\varphi'\\), unrelated and independent on one another as the\n\n* Méc.

When the attracted point is without the surface, the expression for \\( V \\), in order to embrace the whole mass of the spheroid, must be integrated from \\( R' = 0 \\), to \\( R' = R \\), \\( R \\) denoting what \\( R' \\) becomes at the surface; from \\( \\mu' = -1 \\) to \\( \\mu' = 1 \\); and from \\( \\varpi' = 0 \\) to \\( \\varpi' = 2\\pi \\), \\( 2\\pi \\) being the circumference when the radius is unit.

In order to find the part of the integral resulting from the general term, we must multiply that term into the expansion of \\( Q^{(i)} \\) investigated in No. 5; and in combining these two expressions we may omit all the terms which, after multiplication, would contain the sines and cosines of the multiples of \\( \\varphi' \\); because these, when they are integrated with regard to \\( d\\varphi' \\), will be of the same value at both the limits, on which account they will produce nothing in the value of the integral: this being observed, the only term of \\( Q^{(i)} \\) which it is necessary to retain is that one containing \\( \\cos n(\\varphi'-\\varphi) \\), which may be thus written,\nextensive Class of Spheroids.\n\n\\[2\\beta^{(n)} \\cdot (1-\\mu^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot (1-\\mu'^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^nC(i)}{d\\mu^n} \\cdot \\frac{d^nC(i)}{d\\mu'^n} \\cdot \\left\\{ \\cos n\\varpi \\cdot \\cos n\\varpi' + \\sin n\\varpi \\cdot \\sin n\\varpi' \\right\\};\\]\n\nand by combining this with the general term of \\(y'\\), there will result the following expression which is clear of the sines and cosines of variable angles, viz.\n\n\\[(1-\\mu^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^nC(i)}{d\\mu^n} \\cdot \\left\\{ \\cos n\\varpi \\times \\iint \\beta^{(n)} \\cdot (1-\\mu'^2)^n \\cdot \\frac{d^nC(i)}{d\\mu'^n} \\cdot M^{(n)} \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varpi' + \\sin n\\varpi \\times \\iint \\beta^{(n)} \\cdot (1-\\mu'^2)^n \\cdot \\frac{d^nC(i)}{d\\mu'^n} \\cdot N^{(n)} \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varpi' \\right\\};\\]\n\nthis expression again comes under the method of No. 4;

and, for a point in the surface, we may make use of either series, observing to put \\( r = a \\) in all the terms multiplied by \\( a \\), and \\( r = a \\cdot (1 + \\alpha \\cdot y) \\) in the rest. When \\( y' \\) is a finite function, the two expressions for \\( V \\) will both stop. It would be easy to deduce from hence the attractions of heterogeneous spheroids; but having nothing new to offer on this head, I shall refer the reader to Laplace's work, No. 14, Chap. 2, Liv. 3e.\n\nThe two serieses marked (5) and (6) will be found to be entirely equivalent to the formulas (3)* and (4)† which Laplace has given in the second chapter of the third book of the Mécanique Céleste: for in effect the coefficient of \\( \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{a^{i+3}}{r^{i+1}} \\), in two of the serieses; and the coefficient of \\( \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{r^i}{a^{i-2}} \\), in the other two, are only different expressions of the same integral \\( \\int \\int y' \\cdot d\\omega' \\cdot d\\varphi' \\cdot Q^{(i)} \\), the symbol \\( y' \\) being always understood to denote a rational and integral function of three rectangular co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere. In point of result therefore the two methods are one and the same, and the solutions they furnish are both applicable in the same circumstances. Neither of them can be of use, unless the radius of the spheroid be first reduced into such a function as \\( y' \\) is supposed to denote. The one solution can claim no preference\n\n* No. 11.  \n† No. 13.\nto the other, except in deducing the same conclusion with greater clearness and expressing it with greater simplicity, and in a form better fitted to fulfil the views of the analyst. In these respects it can hardly be denied that the procedure delivered in the preceding pages has some advantages above that of the author of the *Mécanique Céleste*. The analysis here given is direct; and it exhibits the several coefficients in separate and independent expressions derived immediately from the radius of the spheroid. On the other hand Laplace's investigation is indirect; and the coefficients are found successively by decomposing the radius of the spheroid into a series of parts which follow a known law. If we now compare the two methods with respect to the grounds on which the investigations are founded we shall not find the same agreement between them. In this paper it is admitted as a necessary hypothesis, that the radius of the spheroid must be a rational and integral function of three co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere: and, in consequence, the result of the analysis is limited to spheroids of that description. Laplace, grounding his investigation on a property which, according to his demonstration, belongs to all spheroids that differ little from spheres, seems to prove that the radius of such a spheroid cannot be an arbitrary expression, and in this inference it is necessarily implied that the radius must be such a function as we have supposed it to be.*\n\n* Méc. Cél. Liv. 3e, No. 11. In No. 11, by substitution in his fundamental theorem, Laplace obtains this formula\n\n\\[4\\pi \\cdot a^2 y = \\frac{U(0)}{a} + \\frac{3U(1)}{a^2} + \\frac{5U(2)}{a^3} + \\&c.\\]\n\nof this he remarks, a few lines below; \"Cette expression de \\(y\\) n'est donc point\nsolution is assumed as a necessary hypothesis without which the investigation will not succeed, in the other, is derived as a necessary consequence of a more general supposition. Here then the two methods are so much at variance, that if one be rigorous and exact, the other cannot be excused from the charge of erroneous or insufficient reasoning. This contradiction between the preceding analysis and the procedure of Laplace is entirely consonant to the conclusions obtained in my former paper alluded to in the beginning of this discourse; and the origin of it is to be sought for in the error I there pointed out in the investigation of that geometer. It cannot be denied that an error of calculation does exist in the demonstration of the theorem on which that author's method is grounded: his reasoning is therefore imperfect and inconclusive; and the inferences he has drawn from it cannot be supported in opposition to a rigorous analysis.\n\n10. The same procedure which has been applied to approximate to the attractions of spheroids differing little from spheres, may likewise be employed to find accurate expressions in serieses of the attractive forces of any spheroid, provided the radius of it be such a function as the analysis requires. In both cases the research turns upon the same sort of integrals. Resume the general term of the series for the attractive force on a point without the surface, viz.\n\n\"arbitraire, mais elle derive du developpement en serie, des attractions des spheroides.\"\n\nIn this formula it is necessarily implied, that \\( y \\) is a rational and integral function of three rectangular co-ordinates of a sphere; because all the terms \\( \\frac{U^{(0)}}{a}, \\frac{U^{(1)}}{a^2}, \\&c. \\) are necessarily such functions.\n\nMDCCCLII.\nMr. Ivory on the Attractions of an\n\n\\[ B^{(i)} = \\frac{1}{i+3} \\int \\int R^{i+3} \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi' \\cdot Q^{(i)}; \\]\n\nsuppose \\( R \\) to be a function of \\( \\mu' \\) only, without \\( \\varphi' \\); then, as before,\n\n\\[ B^{(i)} = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot C^{(i)}}{i+3} \\cdot \\int (1-\\mu'^2)^{\\frac{i}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^i R^{i+3}}{d\\mu'^i} \\cdot d\\mu'; \\]\n\nbut if \\( R \\) be a function of the most general kind, then it must be reduced to this form, viz.\n\n\\[ R^{i+3} = M^{(0)} + (1-\\mu'^2)^{\\frac{i}{2}} \\cdot M^{(1)} \\cdot \\cos \\varphi' + &c. \\]\n\\[ + (1-\\mu'^2)^{\\frac{i}{2}} \\cdot N^{(1)} \\cdot \\sin \\varphi' + &c.; \\]\n\nand the several parts that \\( B^{(i)} \\) will consist of must be separately computed, as in the analogous case already considered. The same process will apply when the attracted point is within the surface.\n\n11. To complete the plan of this discourse, it remains that we apply the theory laid down in it to the case of the ellipsoid. Let the semi-axes be \\( k, k', k'' \\), the first being the least of all the three; and let \\( x, y, z \\), respectively parallel to the same axes, be three co-ordinates of a point in the surface; then will the equation of the solid be\n\n\\[ \\frac{x^2}{k^2} + \\frac{y^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{z^2}{k''^2} = 1; \\]\n\nput \\( x = R\\mu' \\); \\( y = R \\cdot \\sqrt{1-\\mu'^2} \\cdot \\cos \\varphi' \\); and \\( z = R \\cdot \\sqrt{1-\\mu'^2} \\cdot \\sin \\varphi' \\); then by substitution,\n\n\\[ R^2 \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mu'^2}{k^2} + \\frac{(1-\\mu'^2) \\cos^2 \\varphi'}{k'^2} + \\frac{(1-\\mu'^2) \\sin^2 \\varphi'}{k''^2} \\right\\} = 1; \\]\n\nfarther, let \\( e = \\frac{k^2}{k'^2} \\); \\( f = \\frac{k^2}{k''^2} \\); and \\( s = \\mu'^n + e (1-\\mu'^2) \\cos \\varphi' + f \\cdot (1-\\mu'^2) \\cdot \\sin \\varphi' \\); then \\( R = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{s}} \\); and if this value of \\( R \\), or the radius of the ellipsoid, be substituted in the general\nterm of the series for the attractive force on a point within the spheroid (No. 8), that term will become\n\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{i-2} \\cdot \\frac{r_i}{k^{i-2}} \\cdot \\int \\int s^{\\frac{i-2}{2}} \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi' \\cdot Q^{(i)}. \\]\n\nIn the first place I say that all the terms in which \\( i \\) is odd are evanescent. For \\( s = \\frac{e+f}{2} + (1 - \\frac{e+f}{2}) \\cdot \\mu'^2 + \\frac{e-f}{2} \\cdot (1-\\mu'^2) \\cos. 2\\varphi' \\); whence it follows that \\( s^{\\frac{i-2}{2}} \\) may be expanded into a series of this form, viz. \\( A^{(0)} + A^{(1)} \\cdot \\cos. 2\\varphi' + A^{(2)} \\cdot \\cos. 4\\varphi' \\ldots A^{(n)} \\cdot \\cos. 2n\\varphi' \\ldots &c.; \\) of which the general term is \\( A^{(n)} \\cdot \\cos. 2n\\varphi' \\), and if we combine this quantity with the expansion of \\( Q^{(i)} \\) (No. 5), there will result one term, and only one, independent of sines and cosines, viz.\n\n\\[ \\beta^{(2n)} \\cdot (1-\\mu'^2)^{\\frac{3n}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n}C^{(i)}}{d\\mu'^{2n}} \\cdot \\int \\int (1-\\mu'^2)^{\\frac{3n}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n}C^{(i)}}{d\\mu'^{2n}} \\cdot A^{(n)} \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi'; \\]\n\nall the other terms, produced by the multiplication, contain sines or cosines of variable angles; on which account they vanish when they are integrated with regard to \\( d\\varphi' \\) between the required limits: since \\( s \\) contains no other power of \\( \\mu' \\) but \\( \\mu'^2 \\), it is plain that every coefficient of the developement of \\( s^{\\frac{i-2}{2}} \\), as \\( A^{(n)} \\), will be an even function of \\( \\mu' \\), or will contain only even powers of that quantity: and, because \\( i \\) is odd, therefore \\( C^{(i)} \\), and all its fluxions of the even orders, will be odd functions of \\( \\mu' \\): upon the whole then the quantity under the double sign of integration will be an odd function of \\( \\mu' \\); or it will be an assemblage of the odd powers of that quantity: therefore the integral, between the limits \\( \\mu' = 1 \\) and \\( \\mu' = -1 \\), is equal to\nnothing (No. 4). Therefore all the terms are evanescent when \\( i \\) is odd.\n\nAgain I say that all the terms are evanescent when \\( i \\) is even, except when it is \\( = 2 \\). For in this case \\( s^{\\frac{i-2}{2}} \\) will be an integer power, and it will contain a finite number of terms which may be generally represented thus, viz.\n\n\\[\n(1 - \\mu'^2)^{\\frac{in}{2}} \\cdot M^{(n)} \\cdot \\cos 2n\\varphi';\n\\]\n\n\\( M^{(n)} \\) being a rational and integral function of \\( \\mu' \\); and this quantity when combined with the development of \\( Q^{(i)} \\), will produce one term, and only one, clear of sines and cosines, viz.\n\n\\[\n(1 - \\mu'^2)^{\\frac{an}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n}C^{(i)}}{d\\mu'^{2n}} \\cdot \\int \\int \\beta^{(2n)} \\cdot (1 - \\mu'^2)^{\\frac{an}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n}C^{(i)}}{d\\mu'^{2n}} \\cdot M^{(n)} \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi':\n\\]\n\nnow since \\( \\mu'^2 \\) is the greatest power in \\( s \\), the greatest power in \\( s^{\\frac{i-2}{2}} \\) will be \\( \\mu'^{i-2} \\); therefore \\( (1 - \\mu'^2)^{2n} \\cdot M^{(n)} \\) cannot contain any power of \\( \\mu' \\) greater than \\( i - 2 \\), nor \\( M^{(n)} \\) any greater than \\( i - 2n - 2 \\), which number the dimensions of \\( M^{(n)} \\) cannot pass; but \\( i - 2n \\), greater than \\( i - 2n - 2 \\), denotes the dimensions of \\( \\frac{d^{2n}C^{(i)}}{d\\mu'^{2n}} \\): therefore, by a property of this sort of integrals already demonstrated (No. 4), the preceding quantity is evanescent. Therefore all those terms of the series are evanescent in which \\( i \\) is an even number; but from this the case of \\( i = 2 \\), when the term assumes a particular form, must be excepted.\n\nIf now we reject all the terms that have been proved to be evanescent, we shall have, for a point within or in the surface of the ellipsoid,\n\\[\nV = -\\frac{2\\pi r^2}{3} + \\frac{k^2}{2} \\int \\int \\frac{d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi'}{s} - \\frac{r^2}{2} \\int \\int \\log s \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi' Q^{(2)}:\n\\]\n\nin the last term I have written \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\log s \\) for \\( \\log \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{s}} = \\log k \\)\n\n\\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\log s; \\) because \\( \\int Q^{(2)} \\cdot d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi' = 0. \\)\n\nBefore we pursue the investigation farther, we shall stop to demonstrate a property of the attractions of a shell of homogeneous matter bounded by the surfaces of two ellipsoids, similar to one another and similarly placed, on a point within the shell. If we suppose \\( k \\) to denote the axis of the greater ellipsoid, and put \\( h \\) for the corresponding axis of the smaller one; then the value of \\( V \\) relatively to the latter solid will be found merely by changing \\( k \\) into \\( h \\) in the last expression; because \\( s \\) contains no quantities but such as are common to the two solids: therefore the value of \\( V \\), relatively to the shell of matter included between the two surfaces, will be equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k^2 - b^2}{2} \\int \\int \\frac{d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi'}{s};\n\\]\n\na quantity which is independent on the position of the attracted point: therefore the differential coefficients of \\( V \\) for any co-ordinates of the attracted point are evanescent; and consequently so are the attractive forces parallel to the co-ordinates (No. 6). Therefore a material point within such a shell is attracted equally in opposite directions.\n\nLet us now investigate the value of\n\n\\[\n\\int \\int \\frac{d\\mu' \\cdot d\\varphi'}{s};\n\\]\n\nput \\( p = e + (1-e) \\cdot \\mu'^2;

y = R' \\cdot \\mu' ; z = R \\cdot \\sqrt{1-\\mu'^2} \\cdot \\sin^2 \\varphi' \\); which substitutions are entirely arbitrary; we should have found \\( s = e\\mu'^2 + (1-\\mu'^2) \\cos^2 \\varphi' + f \\times (1-\\mu'^2) \\sin^2 \\varphi' \\);

q = f + (e-f) \\cdot \\mu'^2; \\)\n\nalso \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{p}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\varphi'}{\\cos \\varphi'} = \\frac{\\sin u}{\\cos u}: \\) then, \\( s = p \\cdot \\cos^2 \\varphi' + q \\cdot \\sin^2 \\varphi'; \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{d\\varphi'}{s} = \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{pq}}; \\) consequently, by substitution, and integrating with regard to \\( u \\), and confining the integration with regard to \\( \\mu' \\) between the limits \\( \\mu' = 0 \\) and \\( \\mu' = 1 \\); we shall get,\n\n\\( 2\\pi \\cdot b^2 \\cdot \\int \\frac{e \\cdot \\mu'^2 \\cdot d\\mu'}{\\sqrt{1+(e-1) \\cdot \\mu'^2} \\cdot \\left\\{ f+(e-f) \\cdot \\mu'^2 \\right\\}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot b^2}{3}. \\)\nIf we make \\( \\mu' = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{e + (1-e)x^2}} \\);* the integral in the last expression will be transformed into\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ef}} \\int \\frac{x^2 \\cdot dx^2}{\\left(1 + x^2x^2\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ef}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{dF}{d\\lambda}\\right)\n\\]\n\ntherefore the value of this term is\n\n\\[\n- \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot b^2}{\\sqrt{ef}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{dF}{d\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot b^2}{3}\n\\]\n\nAnd, by proceeding in a manner entirely analogous, it may be shewn that the remaining term multiplied by \\( c^2 \\), is equal to\n\n\\[\n- \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot c^2}{\\sqrt{ef}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{dF}{d\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot c^2}{3}\n\\]\n\nIf \\( M \\) denote the mass of the ellipsoid, then \\( M = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\cdot kk'k'' \\)\n\n\\( = \\frac{4\\pi \\cdot k^3}{3 \\cdot \\sqrt{ef}} \\);

and hence when \\( \\lambda = \\lambda' \\), \\( dF = 2 \\left(\\frac{dF}{d\\lambda}\\right) d\\lambda \\): now when \\( \\lambda = \\lambda' \\), \\( F = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\cdot \\text{arc. tan. } \\lambda \\);
