VIII. A Letter from Mr. Thomas Jones to James Jurin, M.D. F.R.S. and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London, concerning the High Tide in the River Thames, on Feb. 16, 1735-6.

SIR,

As you was pleased to desire an Account of the Tide's flowing on the 8th of March, 1725-6, which then flowed twenty Foot five Inches and a half, as I took it by a Level from that High Water Mark to Low Water the next Morning, and was four Inches higher than had been known for forty Years before.

I have now to add, that having mark'd that High Tide on a Post, on Monday the 16th Instant the Tide rose at the same Place six Inches and three Quarters above that Mark, and flowed near two Foot the last half Hour but one before High Water.

I am,

SIR,

New-Crane, Feb. 17th, 1735-6.

Your most humble, and obedient Servant,

THO. JONES.

N.B. If the Tide had flowed its full Time, it would have flowed half an Hour longer, and had drowned the whole Level.
