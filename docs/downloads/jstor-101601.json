That there was much discourse at Paris about the New Star near the Beak of Cygnus, first discover'd by a Carthusian of Dyon, call'd Antelme, who sent the news of it to M. L'Abbé Marlotte, one of the Royal Academy there, who had communicated it to the rest: That they all agree, 'tis a New Star; though Mons. B. opposed it at first, affirming it to be in Bayerus's Tables. That they prove that Star in Bayerus to be another; giving, for distinction, these Measures.\n\nThe bright Star ad Rostrum Cygni its Ascensio recta 289°.22'.0'.\nDeclinatio Borealis 27°.19'.20.\nBut this New Star's Ascensio Recta is 293°.33'.0.\nDeclinatio Borealis 26°.33'.20.\nLongitudo 1°.55'33\".\nLatitudo 47°.28'.10.\nIt's Dist. from that ad Rostrum Cygni towards Jaculum 3°.47'.\n\nSome",
