Mr. Evelyn being obliged to leave the Town some time before the Copies designed for his Friends, could be corrected of some more obvious Faults (omitted to have been inserted among the rest of the Errata) desires the following Notice may be publish'd in these Transactions; as it should have been in the former Months, when an Account was given of his Book, had he known it was then a doing.

Pag. 22. Line 2. read, mixt and Obryze fort also, which has on it a horse, rudely design'd; with the Letters CONOB. * Constantinopoli Obritzatum; Others, some prince of ours. p. 51. l. 9. read Erminius. I know very well Spanheime flights this Medal; but I am not willing to degrade our Noble City of her so early Metropolitan Dignity, without a Demonstration, having a Learned Person on my side. p. 207. in Margine, read for Richborough, Reubium.

These, and some more, were unhappily left out of the printed Corrigenda.
