XXXII. Catalogue of North Polar Distances of Eighty-four principal fixed Stars, deduced from Observations made with the Mural Circle at the Royal Observatory. By John Pond, Esq. Astronomer Royal, F. R. S.

Read July 8, 1813.

The Catalogue, which I have the honour to transmit to the Society, is deduced from the whole of the observations made with the mural circle, from its first erection in June, 1812, to the present time. I am still employed in endeavouring to give it a greater degree of precision, and when it is entirely finished, I propose to submit some of the observations themselves to the Society, and explain the method by which the results have been obtained.

I have already mentioned, that I use neither level nor plumb-line; but determine the position of the instrument by means of a standard catalogue of stars derived from the instrument itself, in such a manner, that every series of observation of these stars, serves the double purpose of ascertaining the position of the instrument, and at the same time improving the Catalogue.

As the present Catalogue has been formed by frequently changing the position of the telescope on the circle, for the purpose of correcting every possible error of division, my observations have not been calculated to decide the question of parallax which has been suspected to exist in α Lyrae, α
Aquilæ, and some other stars. But from this time forward, I propose to use the instrument in one position of the telescope, with the hope of ascertaining, if not the parallax of these stars, at least the limits, which it does not exceed.

Though the change of position in the telescope, by which all error of division is avoided, is one of the most beautiful properties of this instrument, yet so accurately is it divided, that I cannot perceive, with certainty, any effect produced by this change, for I have often found as great a discordance between two series of observations made on the same divisions, as when they are entirely changed by a new position of the telescope. What the error of division may amount to in any one position, I cannot exactly say; but, I think, when the six microscopes are used, it can never exceed half a second, and very rarely amounts to half that quantity.

That some opinion may be formed of the accuracy of this instrument, I have subjoined to the Catalogue the results of the observations of some of the standard stars, whose places I am anxious to determine with the greatest precision, since I propose in future to determine all north polar distances by comparison with these stars; precisely in the same manner as right ascensions are now determined by comparison with the thirty-six stars, whose places have been so accurately determined by Dr. Maskelyne.

This result is probably exact to within a quarter of a second. The discordances seem quite accidental, they neither arise from parallax, nor error of division, for the three last series were made with the telescope in the same position, and consequently upon the same division, yet they differ more than observations usually do, which are made in different positions.

This determination of γ Draconis is extremely exact. Its zenith distance has also been determined, with equal accuracy, by 120 observations made with the zenith sector during the years 1811 and 1812: the mean of above 60 observations of 1811 do not differ more than one-tenth of a second from the mean of an equal number in 1812.

Mean zenith distance beginning of 1813 by observations of 1811 - - - 2° 17.8
By observations in 1812 - - - 2° 17.9
Mean zen. distance by zenith sector - - - 2° 17.85
N.P.D. by mural circle - - - 38° 29' 3.65"

#### Aldebaran.

|-----------------------|-------------|---------|
| June 23, 28, July 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 26, 28 | 35,614      | 35,614  |

| July 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30 | 35,142      | 35,365  |

Result very exact.
### β Leonis.

| Date                  | Observation | Mean of Observations |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1812, June 13, 14, 15, 22, 29, July 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 | 57°544      | Mean of 10           | 57°544 |

This star has not been often observed, owing to its proximity in right ascension to γ Urs. Maj.; but the result is probably exact to within 0°3, as it very seldom happens that the mean of twenty observations differs a quarter of a second from the truth.

### α Herculis.

Result very exact.

### α Pegasi.

|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1812, Oct. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16              | 51°330      | Mean of 10           | 51°330 |
| Oct. 17, 21, 28, Nov. 3, 7, 9, 19, Dec. 5, 7, 12        | 52°060      | Mean of 20           | 51°695 |

This star is reserved for future examination.
### Regulus

| Oct. 4, 6, 12, 14, 15, 19, 20, 23, 27, 28           | 22.543 |
| Nov. 5, 1813, Mar. 7, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 22, 23, 26 | 22.236 |
| Mar. 29, 31, Apr. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11           | 22.148 |
| Apr. 12, 13, 14, 20, 26, May 24, 28, 31, June 2, 7   | 22.665 |
| June 8, 11, July 6, 7, 9                            | 22.576 |

Not to be relied on with the same confidence as some others, as one of the above series differs a second from the mean; the result may be erroneous a quarter of a second, but, I think, not much more.
α Ophiuchi.

Some discordances in the above observations, which I cannot explain, render the result doubtful, and I reserve this star for future examination.

The mean of more than 200 observations of this star is $1^\circ 41' 21",75$. The above 167 were selected in preference; the result, however, is the same.

Notwithstanding the great number of observations of this star, there are discordances which render the result doubtful to $0",25$. If the observations with four microscopes, previous to Oct. 1812, be rejected, the mean result with six microscopes will be $1^\circ 41' 21",6$, which I prefer to the above.
The following Table shews the State of the Standard Catalogue at this present Time, Sept. 1813.*

† The N. P. D. of Procyon in the former Catalogue was 15°,03"; this was from a mistake of 1°,0 committed in adding the annual variation, it should have been 14°,03".

Remarks on the above Observations.

α Lyrae and α Aquilae having been supposed subject to a sensible parallax, I have, as I mentioned before, reserved them for future examination. The observations which I have already made on these stars, and particularly on α Aquilae, are not incompatible with this supposition, though I cannot at present venture to decide whether the small discordances I have met with are to be attributed to any regular cause, or are only accidental.

Whenever I speak of the degree of exactness to which any result may be depended upon, I allude only to the mechanical measure given by the instrument. I have every reason to believe, that if two fixed and well defined points could be placed in the plane of the meridian, I could, in a very short time, measure their angular distance to within a tenth of a second; but astronomers must be well aware that the stars are not presented to us in this simple form, and that the sources from which small errors may arise, either in the observations themselves or subsequent computation, are so very numerous, that anomalies will occur even to the most careful observer, which he will in vain endeavour to explain. With respect to the parallax of α Lyrae, I might observe that it is a star so badly defined, and so little adapted for exact observation, that a parallax of half a second would not be easy to determine even with the Greenwich circle.

α Aquilae is in some respects a better star for observation, but only half its actual parallax would be sensible in declination.
There are several other stars much better adapted for this investigation, even should their distance be supposed more than double, such are Polaris, η Ursæ maj. α Cygni, β Urs. min. and γ Draconis; now in these I have not hitherto found any sensible parallax; occasional discordance has frequently suggested some slight hopes, but these have always been disappointed by continuing the observations. It is, however, useless now to anticipate this subject farther.

Those stars which are in the general Catalogue, but which do not form part of the standard Catalogue, I presume to be exact to the nearest second.

I have not included any star in the standard Catalogue south of the equator, on account of the uncertainty of refraction.
