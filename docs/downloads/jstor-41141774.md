ERRATA.—PART III.

In Mr. Herschel's Paper on the Parallax of the Fixed Stars.

Page 272, line 21, for "sin. l" read "sin. λ."

— 274, line 15, for "sin. l" read "sin. λ."

— 274, line 17, instead of the equation there set down, read as follows:

\[ \text{Sin. } \lambda \cdot \tan(\phi - l) = \tan(\pi - \sigma); \quad (2) \]

In consequence of these corrections, the dates in Col. 5 of the table page 277 and 278, which have been inadvertently computed from the erroneous formula, are for the most part incorrect.

Page 347, line 16, for crest, read crust.

— 348, line 10, supply a comma after "upon it," and omit one after "covers it."

— 361, line 3, for "those," read "of those."

— ib. line 7, for "the length," read "a length."

— 365, line 12, for "particular," read "particularly."

— 371, line 6, supply a comma after "ligament," and omit one after "cuticle."

ERRATA.—PART IV.

Page 24, Col. Mean Chron. line 6 from bottom, for 2 15 52,44, read 2 16 52,44.

And in Col. Mean Clock, last line, for 22 20 13,25, read 12 20 13,25.

— 31, The second register of the State of the Barometer on the morning of the 18th of June, for Begs. read Ends.

— 73, line 12, for encreasing, read increasing.

— 106, opposite April 14th, insert A. M.

— 126, line 11, for Appendix, read Appendices.

— 127, wherever the word axis occurs, read axes.

— 151, Col. reading of North End of needle, line 18 from bottom, erase the sign (+).

— 189, line 10 from bottom, after figures 3, 4, and 5, insert Plate VI.

— 209, lines 6 and 7 from bottom, for Tables VIII. to XI. read VII. to XII.
