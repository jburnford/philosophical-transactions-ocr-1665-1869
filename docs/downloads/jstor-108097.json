Murphy, M.A. Fellow of Caius College, Honorary Member of various Philosophical Societies. Communicated by J. W. Lubbock, Esq. F.R.S.\n\nReceived December 8,—Read December 22, 1836.\n\n§ 1.\n\n1. The elements of which every distinct analytical process is composed are three, namely, first the Subject, that is, the symbol on which a certain notified operation is to be performed; secondly, the Operation itself, represented by its own symbol; thirdly, the Result, which may be connected with the former two by the algebraic sign of equality.\n\nThus let \\(a\\) be the subject representing, we may suppose, some quantity, \\(b\\) the symbol for multiplication by \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) the result or product; for greater distinctness let the subject be inclosed in square brackets, the analytical process in this case is \\([a] b = c\\).\n\nAgain, let \\(x^n\\) be the subject, \\(\\psi\\) a symbol of operation denoting that \\(x\\) must be changed into \\(x + h\\), and \\((x + h)^n\\) will evidently be the result, or\n\n\\[\n[x^n] \\psi = (x + h)^n.\n\\]\n\nAgain, let \\(a^x\\) be the subject, \\(\\Delta\\) a symbol of operation, which indicates that we are to subtract the subject itself from that which it becomes when \\(x\\) is changed into \\(x + h\\), which is usually called taking the finite difference, then the result is\n\n\\[\na^{x+h} - a^x,\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n[a^x] \\Delta = [a^x] (a^h - 1).\n\\]\n\nLastly, let \\(d_x\\) denote the operation of taking the finite difference, and after dividing it by \\(h\\), then putting \\(h = 0\\), which is the same as finding the differential coefficient of the subject, which we may suppose represented by \\(u\\), then\n\n\\[\n[u] d_x = \\frac{du}{dx}.\n\\]\n2. The operations written as above are *monomial*, consisting of only one term; and *polynomial* operations give the sums or the differences of the results of the respective monomials of which they are formed, according as these monomials are affected by the signs $+$ or $-$.\n\nThus if 1 as an operation be understood as the multiplying of the subject by unity which leaves it unaltered, and the symbols $\\psi$, $\\Delta$ have the same signification as in art. 1, then\n\n$$[u] (\\psi - 1) = [u] \\Delta$$\n\n$$[u] (\\Delta + 1) = [u] \\psi,$$\n\nwhere the subject $u$ is any quantity whatever.\n\nWhen general relations, such as these, between different symbols exist independently of the particular value of the subject, we may abstract the consideration of the latter, and the sign $=$ between symbols of operation being understood to indicate that they are universally equivalent, the symbols used in art. 1 would have the following relations independent of the subject.\n\n$$\\Delta = \\psi - 1, \\quad \\psi = \\Delta + 1, \\quad \\psi - \\Delta = 1,$$\n\n$$d_x = \\frac{\\Delta}{h} = \\frac{\\psi - 1}{h},$$\n\nwhen $h$ is put $= 0$.\n\n3. A compound operation consists of a series of simple defined operations, *monomial* or *polynomial*, the subject of each individual in this series after the first being the result of all the preceding operations.\n\nThus $[x^2] a \\psi \\Delta d_x$ denotes that first $x^2$ must be multiplied by $a$, which gives $a x^2$; then the operation $\\psi$, which denotes the putting $x + h$ for $x$, gives $a (x + h)^2$; next the operation $\\Delta$ will give $a (x + 2 h)^2 - a (x + h)^2$, or $a (2 h x + 3 h^2)$; and lastly, the symbol of taking the differential coefficient relative to $x$ gives $2 h a$: the final or complete result is therefore\n\n$$[x^2] a \\psi \\Delta d_x = 2 h a.$$\n\nWhen all the symbols in a compound operation are exactly the same, then for abridgment the whole operation is represented by writing an index to the right of the symbol for the simple operation over it, this index expressing the number of times the simple operation is repeated. Thus\n\n$$[x^2] \\psi^3 = [x^2] \\psi \\psi \\psi = [(x + h)^2] \\psi \\psi = [(x + 2 h)^2] \\psi = (x + 3 h)^2.$$\n\nBut when the simple operations are different, they must be written consecutively in the order in which they are to be performed, unless that order of arrangement by the mutual relations of the operations should be indifferent. Thus\n\n$$[x^n] x \\psi = [x^{n+1}] \\psi = (x + h)^{n+1}$$\n\n$$[x^n] \\psi x = [(x + h)^n] x = x (x + h)^n.$$\nBut\n\n\\[ [x^n] a \\psi = [a x^n] \\psi = a (x + h)^n \\]\n\\[ [x^n] \\psi a = [(x + h)^n] a = a (x + h)^n. \\]\n\nin the latter case the order of the operations is indifferent, because the operation \\( \\psi \\) does not act on the multiplier \\( a \\), and for the contrary reason the order of \\( x \\psi \\) is fixed in the first case.\n\nOperations are therefore relatively fixed or free; in the first case a change in the order in which they are to be performed would affect the result, in the second case it would not do so.\n\nIn a compound operation any part of the symbols may be taken conjointly with the subject in the square brackets, their result being the subject for the compound operation of the remaining symbols. Thus\n\n\\[ [x^2] a \\psi \\Delta d_x = [a x^2] \\psi \\Delta d_x. \\]\n\n§ 2.\n\n4. Linear operations in analysis are those of which the action on any subject is made up by the several actions on the parts, connected by the sign \\(+ \\) or \\(-\\), of which the subject is composed.\n\nLet \\( p \\) denote the operation of multiplying by a quantity \\( p \\), then\n\n\\[ [a + b] p = [a] p + [b] p; \\]\n\nthis operation is therefore linear.\n\nLet \\( \\psi \\) denote the operation of changing \\( x \\) into \\( x + h \\), then if \\( f(x), \\varphi(x) \\) be any functions of \\( x \\), we have\n\n\\[ [f(x) + \\varphi(x)] \\psi = f(x + h) + \\varphi(x + h) = [f(x)] \\psi + [\\varphi(x)] \\psi, \\]\n\nwhich shows that \\( \\psi \\) is also a linear operation.\n\nLet \\( X + \\xi \\) represent the subject acted on, and \\( \\theta, \\theta' \\) any linear operations, then\n\n\\[ [X + \\xi] (\\theta + \\theta') = [X + \\xi] \\theta + [X + \\xi] \\theta' \\]\n\\[ = [X] \\theta + [\\xi] \\theta + [X] \\theta' + [\\xi] \\theta'; \\]\n\nhence polynomial operations of which the parts are linear possess themselves the same character.\n\nThus \\( \\Delta \\) the operation of Finite Differences is linear, because \\( \\Delta = \\psi - 1 \\), the operation \\( \\psi \\) of changing \\( x \\) into \\( x + h \\) and the multiplying by unity being both linear.\n\nAlso\n\n\\[ [X + \\xi] \\theta \\theta' = [X \\theta + \\xi \\theta'] \\theta' \\]\n\\[ = [X] \\theta \\theta' + [\\xi] \\theta \\theta', \\]\n\nwhich shows that the compounds of linear operations are also linear.\n\nThe operation of taking the differential coefficient is therefore linear, for the opera-\ntion $\\Delta$ of finite differences and that of dividing by $h$ being both of that character, the compound $\\Delta \\cdot \\frac{1}{h}$ is generally linear, and must remain so in the limiting state when $h$ vanishes. Hence every function of a linear operation is itself of the same class of operations.\n\n5. The composition of polynomial linear operations is effected in the same manner as algebraic multiplication; with, however, this peculiarity—the order of the compound operations, when not relatively free, must be strictly preserved.\n\nThus let $\\theta$, $\\theta'$, $\\iota$, $\\iota'$ represent linear operations: then\n\n$$[u] (\\theta + \\theta') (\\iota + \\iota') = [u] (\\theta \\iota + \\theta' \\iota + \\theta \\iota' + \\theta' \\iota');$$\n\nfor $\\iota'$ being linear will act on each of the parts $[u] \\theta$, $[u] \\theta'$, which form their subject.\n\nAgain, when $\\theta$, $\\theta'$ are relatively fixed, $[u] (\\theta + \\theta')^2$ will not, as in algebraic involution, be identical with $[u] (\\theta^2 + 2 \\theta \\theta' + \\theta'^2)$, its correct value being $[u] (\\theta^2 + \\theta' \\theta + \\theta \\theta' + \\theta'^2)$; which, however, is the same as the former expression, when $\\theta$, $\\theta'$ are relatively free; for then $\\theta' \\theta = \\theta \\theta'$.\n\nSimilarly\n\n$$(\\theta + \\theta')^3 = (\\theta^3 + \\theta' \\theta^2 + \\theta \\theta' \\theta + \\theta'^2 \\theta) + (\\theta^2 \\theta' + \\theta' \\theta \\theta' + \\theta \\theta'^2 + \\theta'^3);$$\n\nor putting $\\theta^{(2)} \\theta'$ for the sum of the compound operations in which $\\theta$ twice enters, and $\\theta'$ and $\\theta^{(2)}$ for the sum of those containing $\\theta$ once and $\\theta'$ twice, this may also be written\n\n$$(\\theta + \\theta')^3 = \\theta^3 + \\theta^{(2)} \\theta' + \\theta \\theta^{(2)} + \\theta'^3;$$\n\nand employing a similar notation, we shall have, when $n$ is a positive integer,\n\n$$(\\theta + \\theta')^n = \\theta^{(n)} + \\theta^{(n-1)} \\theta' + \\theta^{(n-2)} \\theta^{(2)} + \\ldots + \\theta^{(n-2)} \\theta^{(2)} + \\theta \\theta^{(n-1)} + \\theta^{(n)}.$$\n\nThe term $\\theta^{(n-1)} \\theta'$ in this formula is the sum of $n$ terms, formed by placing $\\theta'$ at the beginning, at the end, and in all the $n - 2$ intermediate positions of the expression $\\theta \\theta \\theta \\ldots (n - 1)$ times. Similarly, by the known theory of permutations, $\\theta^{(n-2)} \\theta^{(2)}$ is the sum of $\\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2}$ terms, &c.\n\nHence when $\\theta$, $\\theta'$ are relatively free, we have\n\n$$(\\theta + \\theta')^n = \\theta^n + n \\theta^{n-1} \\theta' + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\theta^{n-2} \\theta'^2 + \\ldots + n \\theta \\theta^{n-1} + \\theta^n.$$\n\n6. The following theorems are immediately deducible from the general expansion of the preceding article:\n\nSince $\\Delta = \\psi - 1$, therefore\n\n$$\\Delta^n = (\\psi - 1)^n = \\psi^n - n \\psi^{n-1} + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\psi^{n-2} - \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\psi^{n-3} + \\ldots + (-1)^n;$$\n\nor, if we introduce the subject $f(x)$, and observe that $[f(x)] \\psi^n = f(x + nh)$, then\n\n$$\\Delta^n f(x) = f(x + nh) - nf\\{x + (n-1) \\cdot h\\} + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} f\\{x + (n-2) \\cdot h\\}, \\ldots,$$\nAgain, \\( \\psi = \\Delta + 1 \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\psi^n = (\\Delta + 1)^n = 1 + n \\Delta + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\Delta^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\Delta^3 + \\ldots + \\Delta^n;\n\\]\n\nor, introducing the subject \\( f(x) \\),\n\n\\[\nf(x + nh) = f(x) + n \\Delta f(x) + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\Delta^2 f(x) + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\Delta^3 f(x) + \\ldots \\quad (II.)\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( 1 = \\psi - \\Delta \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n1 = (\\psi - \\Delta)^n = \\psi^n - n \\psi^{n-1} \\Delta + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\psi^{n-2} \\Delta^2 - \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\psi^{n-3} \\Delta^3 + \\ldots + (-1)^n \\Delta^n,\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nf(x) = f(x + nh) - n \\Delta f(x + (n-1)h) + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\Delta^2 f(x + (n-2)h) - \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\Delta^3 f(x + (n-3)h), \\ldots \\quad (III.)\n\\]\n\nIn the expansion (II.) put \\( nh = k \\), or \\( n = \\frac{k}{h} \\): therefore\n\n\\[\nf(x + k) = f(x) + k \\frac{\\Delta}{h} f(x) + \\frac{k(k-h)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta}{h} \\right)^2 f(x) + \\frac{k(k-h)(k-2h)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta}{h} \\right)^3 f(x), \\ldots \\quad (IV.)\n\\]\n\nNow suppose \\( n \\) to increase infinitely, \\( k \\) remaining constant, the quantity \\( h \\), which is the increment of \\( x \\), diminishes infinitely, and the operation \\( \\frac{\\Delta}{h} \\) in the limiting state when \\( h \\) vanishes, becomes \\( d_x \\). Hence\n\n\\[\nf(x + k) = f(x) + k d_x f(x) + \\frac{k^2}{1 \\cdot 2} d_x^2 f(x) + \\frac{k^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} d_x^3 f(x) + \\ldots \\quad (IV.)\n\\]\n\nThe expansions (II.) (IV.) are Taylor's theorems for the development of functions by means of their finite differences and their differential coefficients respectively.\n\nAgain, if \\( h \\) be written for \\( k \\) in the expansion (IV.), and the subject be omitted, it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\psi = 1 + h d_x + \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} d_x^2 + \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} d_x^3 + \\ldots \\quad (V.)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = h d_x + \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} d_x^2 + \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} d_x^3, \\ldots \\quad (V.)\n\\]\n\n§ 3.\n\n7. The expansion given for the operation \\( \\psi \\), of changing \\( x \\) into \\( x + h \\), possesses remarkable properties, which we propose to develop in the present section, from the importance of the theorem of Taylor, which it expresses.\n\nRepresenting, as usual, by \\( \\psi \\) the operation of changing \\( x \\) into \\( x + h \\), and by \\( \\psi' \\) that of changing \\( x \\) into \\( x + h' \\), the quantities \\( h, h' \\) being independent of \\( x \\), and, lastly, denoting by \\( \\psi_i \\) the operation which changes \\( x \\) into \\( x + h + h' \\), we have obviously the identity\n\n\\[\n\\psi \\psi' = \\psi_i;\n\\]\nand putting for these symbols their expansions found in the preceding article, we get\n\n\\[ \\left\\{ 1 + h d_x + \\frac{h^2 d_x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{h^3 d_x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\right\\} \\left\\{ 1 + h' d_x + \\frac{h'^2 d_x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{h'^3 d_x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\right\\} \\]\n\n\\[ = 1 + (h + h') d_x + \\frac{(h + h')^2 d_x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{(h + h')^3 d_x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots; \\]\n\na relation which may be verified by actually compounding the two polynomials of the first member.\n\nNow in this act of verification the operations \\( h d_x, h' d_x \\) have only such properties as are common to any two linear operations which are relatively free: hence if \\( \\theta, \\theta' \\) represent any such operations, we have generally\n\n\\[ \\left\\{ 1 + \\theta + \\frac{\\theta^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{\\theta^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\right\\} \\left\\{ 1 + \\theta' + \\frac{\\theta'^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{\\theta'^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\right\\} \\]\n\n\\[ = 1 + (\\theta + \\theta') + \\frac{(\\theta + \\theta')^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{(\\theta + \\theta')^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}; \\]\n\nand it is easy to extend an identity exactly similar to any number of operations which are all relatively free; for in introducing a new polynomial, \\( 1 + \\theta'' + \\frac{\\theta''^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{\\theta''^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\), we have only to regard \\( \\theta + \\theta' \\) as itself a free linear operation, and therefore the result would be\n\n\\[ 1 + (\\theta + \\theta' + \\theta'') + \\frac{(\\theta + \\theta' + \\theta'')^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{(\\theta + \\theta' + \\theta'')^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots. \\]\n\n8. If the subject be a function of two variables, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), then using \\( \\psi_x \\) to denote that \\( x \\) must be changed into \\( x + h \\), and \\( \\psi_y \\) that \\( y \\) must become \\( y + k \\), these operations are relatively free, it being of no consequence which operation is first performed; therefore the operations \\( \\Delta_x, \\Delta_y \\) of taking the corresponding finite differences are also free; from whence, lastly, the differentiations relative to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), represented by \\( d_x, d_y \\), must be of the same character.\n\nNow since\n\n\\[ \\psi_x = 1 + h d_x + \\frac{h^2 d_x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{h^3 d_x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\psi_y = 1 + k d_y + \\frac{k^2 d_y^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{k^3 d_y^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots, \\]\n\ntherefore, by the general identity of (7.), we have\n\n\\[ \\psi_x \\psi_y = 1 + (h d_x + k d_y) + \\frac{(h d_x + k d_y)^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{(h d_x + k d_y)^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots. \\]\n\nAnd now introducing the subject \\( f(x, y) \\), and expanding the terms in the right member of this identity by the formula given in the preceding section, it will become, in the common notation,\n\\[ f(x + h, y + k) = f(x, y) + \\frac{df(x, y)}{dx} \\cdot h + \\frac{d^2f(x, y)}{dx^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{d^3f(x, y)}{dx^3} \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{df(x, y)}{dy} \\cdot k + \\frac{d^2f(x, y)}{dx \\cdot dy} \\cdot hk + \\frac{d^3f(x, y)}{dx^2 \\cdot dy} \\cdot \\frac{hk^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\ldots \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{d^2f(x, y)}{dy^2} \\cdot \\frac{k^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{d^3f(x, y)}{dx \\cdot dy^2} \\cdot \\frac{hk^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\ldots \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{d^3f(x, y)}{dy^3} \\cdot \\frac{k^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nIf a third variable \\( z \\) becomes \\( z + l \\) by a third operation \\( \\psi'' \\), then the actual composition of the equivalent polynomial \\( 1 + ld_z + \\frac{l^2d_z^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{l^3d_z^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\) gives\n\n\\[ \\psi \\psi' \\psi'' = 1 + (hd_x + kd_y + ld_z) + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2}(hd_x + kd_y + ld_z)^2 + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}(hd_x + kd_y + ld_z)^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nand so this method may be extended, whatever be the number of variables.\n\n9. Let \\( \\theta \\) denote any linear operation, and make\n\n\\[ \\Theta = 1 + \\theta + \\frac{\\theta^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{\\theta^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nthen \\( \\Theta \\) is itself a linear operation; and if in (7.) we put \\( \\theta = \\theta' = \\theta'' = \\ldots \\), and suppose the number of these operations to be \\( n \\), we have by that article\n\n\\[ \\Theta^n = 1 + n\\theta + \\frac{n^2\\theta^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{n^3\\theta^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nAgain, suppose\n\n\\[ \\varphi = 1 + \\frac{\\theta}{m} + \\frac{\\theta^2}{1 \\cdot 2 m^2} + \\frac{\\theta^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 m^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\n\\( m \\) being any positive integer, we have by the same principles\n\n\\[ \\varphi^m = 1 + \\theta + \\frac{\\theta^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{\\theta^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots = \\Theta \\]\n\n\\[ \\varphi^n = 1 + \\frac{n}{m} \\cdot \\theta + \\frac{n^2}{m^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\theta^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{n^3}{m^3} \\cdot \\frac{\\theta^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nHence if \\( \\varphi \\) denote an operation which, repeated \\( m \\) times, gives \\( \\Theta \\), and in which we shall employ the notation \\( \\Theta^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\), then \\( \\varphi^n \\) denotes the same as \\( \\Theta^{\\frac{n}{m}} \\), the latter being the operation which, repeated \\( m \\) times, is the same as \\( \\Theta^n \\).

The consideration of inverse operations leads to the introduction of the appendage, which when the operations are linear must be annexed to the result to give it the most general value of which it is susceptible, for the inverses of such operations are themselves linear; thus if \\( \\theta \\) be a linear operation,\n\n\\[ [X + \\xi] \\theta = [X] \\theta + [\\xi] \\theta. \\]\n\nPut \\([X] \\theta = X_1\\), \\([\\xi] \\theta = \\xi_1\\),\n\nhence \\([X_1 + \\xi_1] \\theta^{-1} = X + \\xi\\)\n\n\\[ = [X_1] \\theta^{-1} + [\\xi_1] \\theta^{-1}, \\]\n\nwhich shows the linearity of \\( \\theta^{-1} \\).\n\nNow suppose the nature of \\( \\theta \\) to be such that \\([P] \\theta = 0\\), the subject \\( P \\) being thus in some way connected with the nature of the operation \\( \\theta \\), then if we suppose\n\n\\[ [X] \\theta = y, \\quad \\text{we have also} \\quad [X + P] \\theta = y, \\quad \\text{hence} \\quad [y] \\theta^{-1} = X + P, \\]\n\nthis being the same as writing \\( y + 0 \\) for \\( y \\), since \\([0] \\theta^{-1} = P \\).\n\nThe appendage therefore in a linear operation is the result of its action on zero; \\( P \\) will express a form, but its magnitude must be susceptible of an infinity of values, that is, it contains arbitrary constants which enter as multipliers, for if \\( a \\) be such a constant, we have in general \\([X] a \\theta = [X] \\theta a \\); and supposing \\( X = 0 \\), we have \\([0 . a] \\theta = [0] \\theta a \\): therefore whatever particular value may be assigned to \\([0] \\theta \\), a more comprehensive value is attained by its arbitrary multiplication by \\( a \\). A multiplier is the most general form in which the operation represented by \\( a \\) can enter when \\( X \\) is a function of but one variable; but it admits of other forms more extended in cases of several variables, as may easily be perceived: thus \\([f(y)] \\psi_x = f'(y), \\psi_x \\) denoting the operation of changing \\( x \\) into \\( x + h \\): hence \\([f(y)] \\Delta_x = 0 \\). Then if \\( X \\) be any function of \\( x \\), and \\( \\xi \\) be any particular value of \\([X] \\Delta_x^{-1} \\), we shall have more generally \\([X] \\Delta_x^{-1} = \\xi + f(y), \\)\nwhich includes the former; since, the form of \\( f(y) \\) being arbitrary, we have \\( \\xi \\) alone, amongst the infinite number of values of \\( \\xi + f(y) \\).\n\nIn compound operations, the appendage obtained by the first simple operation becomes a new subject for the succeeding operations, each of which may in like manner introduce a new appendage.\n\n14. The operation \\( \\psi_x \\), taken directly or inversely, is incapable of introducing any appendage: for suppose \\([0] \\psi_x^{-1} = \\varphi(x)\\), then \\([\\varphi(x)] \\psi_x = 0\\), or \\( \\varphi(x + h) = 0 \\), which identity being general, we may put \\( x \\) instead of \\( x + h \\), which gives \\( \\varphi(x) = 0 \\); from which it also follows that \\([0] \\psi_x^{-n} = 0 \\).\n\nTo find the appendage introduced by \\( d_x^{-1} \\), suppose in the same way \\([0] d_x^{-1} = \\varphi(x) \\), hence \\([\\varphi(x)] d_x = 0 \\), therefore \\([\\varphi(x)] d_x^2 = 0 \\) \\([\\varphi(x)] d_x^3 = 0 \\), &c.; and since\n\n\\[\n\\varphi(x + h) = \\varphi(x) + h \\frac{d \\varphi(x)}{dx} + \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} \\cdot \\frac{d^2 \\varphi(x)}{dx^2} + &c.\n\\]\n\nhence we have \\( \\varphi(x + h) = \\varphi(x) \\), and \\( h \\) being arbitrary, we may put it \\(= -x \\), therefore \\( \\varphi(x) = \\varphi(0) \\), that is, \\( \\varphi(x) \\) is constant relative to \\( x \\); if therefore \\( C \\) be any arbitrary quantity independent of \\( x \\), we have \\([0] d_x^{-1} = C \\).\n\nAgain,\n\n\\[\n[0] d_x^{-2} = [0] d_x^{-1} d_x^{-1} = [C] d_x^{-1} + [0] d_x^{-1},\n\\]\n\nas above stated; but since \\([C_x] d_x = C \\), and \\([0] d_x^{-1} = C' \\), any constant therefore \\([0] d_x^{-2} = C_x + C' \\), and in general\n\n\\[\n[0] d_x^{-n} = A_1 x^{n-1} + A_2 x^{n-2} + A_3 x^{n-3} + \\ldots + A_n,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A_1 A_2 \\ldots A_n \\) denote constant multipliers.\n\nLastly, let \\([0] \\Delta_x^{-1} = \\varphi(x) \\), or \\([\\varphi(x)] \\Delta_x = 0 \\), therefore \\( \\varphi(x + h) = \\varphi(x) \\), and by Taylor's theorem (dividing by \\( \\varphi(x) \\)),\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{\\varphi'(x)}{\\varphi(x)} h + \\frac{\\varphi''(x)}{\\varphi(x)} \\cdot \\frac{h^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + &c.\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\varphi'(x) \\) \\( \\varphi''(x) \\) &c. are the differential coefficients of \\( \\varphi(x) \\); this identity being independent of \\( x \\), the latter quantity must disappear from the series: put therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\varphi'(x)}{\\varphi(x)} = n \\sqrt{-1} \\frac{1}{h}, \\quad n \\text{ being independent of } x;\n\\]\n\nhence\n\n\\[\n\\varphi''(x) = n \\sqrt{-1} \\frac{1}{h} \\varphi'(x) = -\\frac{n^2}{h^2} \\varphi(x) \\quad \\varphi'''(x) = -\\frac{n^3 \\sqrt{-1}}{h^3} \\varphi(x), \\quad &c.\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\n1 = \\sqrt{-1} \\left\\{ n - \\frac{n^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{n^5}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} - &c. \\right\\} + \\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{n^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{n^4}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} - &c. \\right\\} \\quad (a.)\n\\]\n\nAt present suppose \\( n \\) the least real value which satisfies this equation, then\n\n\\[\n\\varphi(x) = C \\varepsilon \\frac{n x \\sqrt{-1}}{h},\n\\]\nalso since $\\varphi(x) = \\varphi(x + h)$ change $x$ into $x + h$ $\\therefore \\varphi(x + h) = \\varphi(x + 2h)$ and generally $\\varphi(x) = \\varphi(x \\pm m h)$, $m$ being an integer; and since $\\varphi(x) = C \\varepsilon^{\\frac{mn\\sqrt{-1}}{mh}}$ satisfies this equation, it follows that $\\pm n \\pm 2n \\pm 3n$, &c. satisfy the equation (a); the complete appendage will therefore be\n\n$$A_1 \\varepsilon^{\\frac{nx\\sqrt{-1}}{h}} + A_2 \\varepsilon^{\\frac{2nx\\sqrt{-1}}{h}} + \\ldots + B_1 \\varepsilon^{\\frac{-nx\\sqrt{-1}}{h}} + B_2 \\varepsilon^{\\frac{-2nx\\sqrt{-1}}{h}} + \\ldots.$$ \n\nthe number of constants being infinite.\n\n§ 5.\n\n15. When the simple operations which compose a compound one are relatively free their places are transmutable, but when fixed a mutation of places will require an alteration in the operations themselves.\n\nLet $\\psi_x$ denote the changing of $x$ into $x + h$ as before, and let $\\theta_x$ be any operation affecting $x$, or, which is the same, fixed relative to $\\psi_x$, then considering $\\theta_x$ as a subject, put $[\\theta_x] \\psi_x = \\theta'_x$, and if the compound operation $[u] \\theta_x \\psi_x$ be proposed, its value by transmutation is $[u] \\psi_x \\theta'_x$, for in the first compound operation $\\psi_x$ affects all the preceding symbols as forming its subject.\n\nAgain, let $[u] \\theta_x \\Delta_x = y$ be proposed for transmutation, we have\n\n$$y = [u] \\theta_x (\\psi_x - 1)$$\n\n$$= [u] (\\psi_x \\theta'_x - \\theta_x),$$\n\nand putting $\\Delta_x + 1$ for $\\psi_x$, and $\\theta_x \\Delta_x$ for the finite difference of $\\theta_x$ considered as one operation, we have\n\n$$y = [u] (\\Delta_x \\theta'_x + \\theta_x \\Delta_x) = [u] \\theta_x \\Delta_x.$$\n\nLastly, divide this identity by $h$, and then put $h = 0$.
