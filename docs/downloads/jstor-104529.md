Thus ends the most magnificent Work I know of, since the Art of Printing has been discover'd: The Descriptions are all given in both English and French; and the Figures being drawn by the ingenious Author after Life, were afterwards etched by himself, and all the illuminated Sets were colour'd under his Directions, and all touch'd up and finish'd by his own Hand.
