LI. Transit of Venus over the Sun, observed June 3, 1769, by Alexander Aubert, in Austin Friars, London, three Seconds of Time East of St. Paul's, with a Cassegrain Reflector of J. Short, having a Metal of two Feet focal Length, and magnifying about 110 Times.

External contact at $7^h\ 8^m\ 13^s$ mean time.
Internal contact at $7^h\ 26^m\ 45^s$ interval $18'32''$.

N.B. At $7^h\ 26'45''$ Venus appeared to me in contact with the Sun, and about $6''$ after I saw the Sun's limb compleated.

The clock could be depended on to less than one second, having been compared with a number of equal altitudes of the Sun, some days before and after the transit.
