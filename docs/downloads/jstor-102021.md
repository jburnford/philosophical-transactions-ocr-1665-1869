nal Conclusions of the Vitriolick Nature of Waters, &c. and answering some Objections proceeds to Salt Springs, none of which, except Vitriolic, give a blackish Tincture with Galls as he avers. He treats next of a Sulphureo-saline Spring; a Sulphureous Spring, a Spring impregnated with the Natron of the Ancients, &c. Lapidescient Springs, he says are from a certain Halitus rising from Alum and Vitriol, which passing through takes along with it some Particles of the Lime-stone, which being mixt with the Water per Minima seems to give it the petrifying Quality; this he confirms by some Observations and Experiments. He speaks in the next place of Acid Springs, and ends with an Appendix of cold Baths, the Diseases for which they seem most proper; and the Manner or Reason of their Cure by these Baths. So much may suffice for a short Account of this Book, which it were to be wisht the Author had wrote in English.
