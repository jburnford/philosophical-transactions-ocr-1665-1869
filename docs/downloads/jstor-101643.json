  "text": "be converted to bear the richest burthens of corn, hay, and grass.\n\n3. His Closet was published in two parts, bound together, A.D. 1651. The first part contains Preserves, Candyng, Pastes, Banqueting conceits, Cordial waters, Conserve, Medicins and Salves. The second part has more of the same, or the like, as Preserves, Conserve, Candyng, Secrets in distillation, Cookery and Huswifry, Sweet powders, Ointments. Further, our Author, having enlarged noble tables, furnish't necessaries for multitudes of the most indigent, enriched husbandmen, found good employments for younger and sickly families, assisted and encouraged ingenious Arts and honest Trades, invented many new, and revived unregarded or too much neglected accommodations, and having taught, how the Sea-waters and Sea-sand may be made a fertilizing compost, and the very Earth a relieving fuel; he thought it best to ingratiate with Ladies, to do many of the good offices of charity, to heal the sick, lame, maimed and wounded, who by poverty were unable to discharge Apothecaries bills, Physitians and Chirurgions; and to impart the elegant huswifry for delicacies, treats, and collations. He taught them, how to convert the wholesome plants and blossoms of their gardens and common fields, hills and pastures, and the fruit of bushes, shrubs and hedges, and many of our taller trees, to be found food and rich wines; even to challenge the blood of the grape; and under the favour and with the assistance of the Sugar-cane, and sometimes with the help of the Alembick, to carry the general applause, and to triumph in victory. And what had now become of our Sugar-plantations, if he had not so happily begun when he did, to shew us the excellencies and infinite uses of Sugar. And as to his Cookery, Columella, who spake the most he could against it, yet himself instructs, How to order Wine, and other liquors, pickles, gamons, and other food, for the best; and marmalades, quinces, and conserves, most agreeable for the Empresses of those days, when the Bee supplied the want of Sugar-canoe. And good Cookery is as ancient, as the reputation of the most famous Physitians, a noble part of their profession. Emperors and Popes had always learned Physitians for Master-cooks. And our Author was follow'd with the Cabinets and Closets of both Illustrious and Learned Persons: The Countess of Arundel's Closet, the Countess of Kent's, Sr. Theodore Mayern's, Sr. Ken. Digby's, the Queen-like Cabinet, the accomplish't Cook, the French Cook, and Rabbiha's Body of Cookery: These two last revised and perfected for the year 1673. And for sure and moderate Cookery, Muffet's Improvement of Health, reprinted 1665, and, as Dr. Bennet thinks, worth all that wrote before him, not excepting Platina, Apicius and Alexandrinus. At this day, Barbados and Jamaica are the better for Ligons skill in Cookery. And, if the Sturgeon of New England be the right Sturgeon, and so chosen and order'd, as Muffet directs, it may be a service (as of old) for an Imperial Table. And all Commanders and Pursers at Sea are concern'd for good marinal pickles, &c.\n\nErrata in Numbr. 112.
