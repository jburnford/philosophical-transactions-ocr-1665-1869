Several autumnal flowers continued in blow all winter; the winter ones were early, and the spring ones forward; many anemonies, which are properly a spring flower, were blowing all winter, but had not then their full colours which they have in their season. This open winter was not a wet one, which was very convenient, as fodder was scarce, and turnips late and small, but were much mended by the mild autumn. The ground was green almost all winter; and there were very few NE winds in March and April, and there was pretty good grass in that last month, which was a great advantage when a colder season came on in May. Oaks began to be cut soon after the 20th of April, and the hawthorns to blow before the end of the month.\n\nWith May began a colder season, with frequent frosty mornings, blasting the fruit after it appeared set, and also the young leaves very much, and more northerly winds, especially toward the end of the month, and the former part of June; for they seldom fail of coming sooner or later in the spring; yet the weather was often fair, fine, and pleasant, but the ground getting too dry. The latter part of June and most of July was remarkably hot, and for the most part burning; but some single large rains in July, particularly toward the end of it, prevented its burning so much here as it did in the south of England, where the drought was greater, and lasted much longer; there they suffered very much by it; but from\nthe forwardness of the beginning of spring we were never without grass, though it was burnt. There were good crops of hay on some of the low moist meadows, but the uplands and late laid were light. The heat of June and July, and middle of August, brought things very forward. Harvest began about July 20, and was nearly finished in August: the crops did not look much amiss upon the ground, but disappointed people, for they yielded badly, especially beans and pease, of which there were very few; barley and oats were the best; but the scarcity of other things made them also dear. Myrtles flowered very fine this summer, because they began in July, which is sooner than usual; they are apt not to begin till the warm weather is almost over. The harvest was in general well got, but not so well at the end as at the beginning, for there were 18 inches of rain in five months, from July to November; great single rains in July, fits of wet in August and September, and almost daily in October and November, with floods and storms; this made great plenty of grass; but the ground became wet and soft, and much trodden, and the turnips were not so good as might have been expected. The crop of fruit was very uncertain; in some places it was very scarce, in other places there was a good deal; but in most the apples rotted extremely. The hedge fruits were in great abundance, excepting ash-keys, of which most people said there were none at all.\n\nThe autumn though wet, was mild; swallows and martins did not go away till about October 18; the autumnal flowers continued till December, anemonies were then in flower; winter and spring flowers were forward, and the leaves of the spring crocus appeared. But the latter half of December the\nscene altered, and the frost began; it was a mixture of severe and moderate frost, falling and melting snows, and floods, with hard frost and breaks; the beginning of a very severe winter, which lasted long into the next year.",
