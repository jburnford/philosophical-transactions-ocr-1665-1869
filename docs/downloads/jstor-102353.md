IV. Account of a BOOK.

ΛΥΚΟΦΡΟΝΟΣ ΤΟΥ ΧΑΛΚΙΔΕΩΣ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΑ,
Καὶ ἐις αὐλὸ τῆς ΙΣΑΚΙΟΥ τῇ ΤΖΕΤΤΖΟΥ ΕΞΗΓΑΜΑ.

Lycophronis Chalcidensis Alexandra, Cum Graecis Isacii Tzetzis Commentariis. Accedunt Versiones, Variantes Lectiones, Emendationes, Annotationes & Indices Necessarii. Curâ & opera Johannis Potteri, A. M. & Collegii Lincolniensis Socii. Oxonii, e Theatro Sheldoniano, An. Dom. 1697.

Lycophron's Cassandra is the only work that remains to us, out of the many Volumes of that Author: 'Tis a Poem the most intricate and obscure of any, that has ever appear'd in the Greek, or other Languages; but whose usefulness does sufficiently compensate for its Obscurity. The Design is thus; Cassandra, the Daughter of Priamus King of Troy, seeing her Brother Paris put to Sea, with an intent to fetch Helena from Greece, and being before instructed by Apollo in the Art of Divination, foretells the manifold Calamities, which that Voyage brought upon her Native Country; and having premis'd an account of the former taking of Troy by Hercules, she enumerates all the Miseries, which the Grecians and Trojans underwent during the long Ten Years Siege of that City, and at the Destruction of it, with the various Fortunes that befell them afterwards, and the numerous Colonies planted by them in Italy, Sicily, and other parts of the World. Then having related from their first Original the Causes of the continual Quarrels be-
between Europe and Asia, and describ'd the memorable Occurrences in Xerxes's Famous Invasion upon Greece, she draws out the Thread of her Discourse as far as the Successors of Alexander the Great, in a most Natural, yet Artful Method. All these Narrations are embellish'd with many pleasant Episodes, and so great variety of Poetical Histories, that by a thorough understanding of this Single Poem, the Reader will be furnish'd with a competent knowledge of the greatest part of the Ancient Mythology: And the Words and Phrases, in which all these are express'd, are such, that whoever has made himself Master of them, can scarce be at a loss in any, the most obscure Passages of other Authors, especially the Poets: So that a careful perusal of this Book, will be a considerable step to a perfect understanding of the Greek Language.

The present Edition is not only render'd more beautiful by a larger and better Character, but seems to be far more Correct and Compleat than any we have yet had of this Author; for it contains, beside a great many accessions, whatever is of Use, or Value in any of the former Impressions. The Text is Corrected as well by the help of the former Printed Editions, as of two Ancient Manuscript Copies in the Bodleian Library, which have been carefully Collated. On one side of it is plac'd the verbal Translation of Canterus; beneath are inserted the various lections faithfully collected out of the foremention'd Copies, which as they may be of use to the Accurate and Critical understanding of any Ancient Author, so are more especially requir'd here, where there are so many obscure passages, wherein Learned Men either do not agree, or are wholly at a loss. Beneath these you have the large Greek Commentaries of Isaac Tzetzes, which were heretofore very imperfect, and in many places so maim'd and corrupted, that they cou'd
could not be understood; but are now, by the assistance of Manuscripts, corrected and enlarged: and at the bottom of every Page is inserted a Brief Account of all the Additions, and principal Emendations made therein. At the end of these is annex'd the excellent Translation of Joseph Scaliger, in Iambick Verses, wherein he has not only faithfully express'd the Sense and Meaning, but the Diction and Style of the Author. After this follow the Annotations of Canterus and Meursius, more Correctly Printed than hitherto they have been. To these, beside necessary Indexes which all the former Editions have wanted, the Editor has added his own Commentaries, wherein several obscure Verses in Lycophron, never throughly understood before, are explain'd; many dark in other Authors are cleared, Corrected and render'd intelligible; and Customs of the Ancient Greeks, absolutely necessary for the Understanding of their Authors, are brought to light.
