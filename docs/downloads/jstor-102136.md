Arteriose blood, and of serum taken promiscuously from both sorts of blood; but it held one pound one ounce and half of grumose blood, clear'd of the serum.

The Author affirms that no Lacteals arise either from the stomach, or Intestina Graffa.

Valves are observ'd in the farther part of the Ductus Thoracicus, near its ending in the Subclavial Vein; contrary to what is affirm'd by some Anatomists.

The Valves, lying in pairs in the Ductus Thoracicus, are generally an Inch and half one pair from another. One Kidney has been found 8 times bigger and heavier, in a Dog, then the other.

The Author affirms that the Lacteals impart no Liquor to the Pancreas Asellii.

Their Origine has been traced as far as the Glandulose Tunic of the Intestines.

There are severall other observations mentioned, concerning the Lacteals, the Ductus Thoracicus, and the valve at the end of it; beside all which the Publisher of this book, Ernestus Gotfried Heyseus of Dantzig, affiures us, that the learned Author has a vast stock of Observations by him; which very much advance Physiological, and Pathological Physic, and as such cannot but be very welcome to the Curious Reader, when ever the Author shall think fit to present them to the world.

There follow severall Quæries de Semine Virili; de Fæmineis Ovis, vel in Ovario, vel extra; de Utero: to which are subjoyned some Corollarys concerning the Human Fætus, whom he will not allow to have a Allantois, or Urachus.
