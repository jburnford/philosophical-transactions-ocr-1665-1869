S. concerning Magnetical Sand.\n\nI send you a little of that Black Sand which in Italy they use instead of Dust to their Letters; it is found Six Miles from Genes near St. Pierre d'araine on the Sea-Shoar. It hath the Properties of the Loadstone, and I do believe that it is Loadstone or Powder of Loadstone, for it followeth the Loadstone; it sticketh to a Knife that is touched with the Loadstone; it draweth a Magnetick Needle; it doth not ferment with Aqua Fortis, as Iron Dust doth; it doth not rust with any Acide that can be put to it; it doth not sparkle in the Flame of a Candle, as Steel-dust doth when it is thrown into the said Flame. It is commonly found on the Sea-Shoar after great Storms.",
