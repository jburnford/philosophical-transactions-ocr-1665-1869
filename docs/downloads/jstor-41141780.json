Foster.\n\nIn the following tables are given the times of maximum and minimum diurnal variation, together with the instrumental range and value in arc of such daily change. In an adjoining column are placed indications of the relative position of the moon with respect to the sun; as there seems some reason to think that these bodies have each its influence on the needle: at all events it will be seen, that in every case the daily variation was always greater when the southern declination of the moon was greatest, and commonly a minimum when her declination was increasing to the northward.* The action of the sun, however, was much less equivocal, and its increasing effect on the daily variation was rendered very manifest as he advanced to the northward.\n\n* The following are the means of the maximum ranges of the needle, for every three days nearest to each quadrature, opposition and conjunction.\n\n| Months | 1st. Quadrature | Conjunction | 2d. Quadrature | Opposition |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|------------|\n| January| 0° 25'          | 0° 33'      | 0° 68'        |            |\n| February| 1° 50'         | 1° 45'      | 0° 57½'       | 0° 41'     |\n| March  | 2° 23'          | 4° 15'      | 1° 20½'       | 2° 53'     |\n| April  | 3° 20'          | 3° 20½'     | 3° 5'         | 2° 34'     |\n| May    | 3° 57'          | 4° 6'       | 4° 2'         | 1° 41'     |\n| Means  | 2° 35'          | 3° 5½'      | 2° 11'        | 2° 9'      |\n\nFrom these means it appears, that the maximum deviation about the time of conjunction, exceeds those at the quadratures, and opposition, in the ratio of 3 to 2 nearly.\nWith a view to placing in evidence the proportional part of the annual variation due to each month, the mean of the maximum west and east expressions, has been assumed as the daily zero, or magnetic meridian; but on reference to the column containing it, there appears such irregularities in its directions, as to render any conclusions drawn from it, very unsatisfactory.\n| Day | Time | Easternly Variation | Westernly Variation | Duration Daily Variations | Amount Daily Variations |

Parry and Lieut. Foster's Observations on magnetic intensity.\n\nAbstract of the Results given in the preceding Table of Intensities.\n\nThe following Table is an abstract of the preceding observations on the diurnal change of intensity of the horizontal magnetic needle, at Port Bowen, during the months of February, March, April, and May, in the year 1825.\n\nThe second, third, fourth, and fifth columns of this Table, have been formed by dividing the sum of the times of vibration at each hour, for every month, by the number of days, for the mean monthly intensity at each hour; and the last column is formed by dividing the sum of all the times, by the number of days, for a general mean result. In this, however, the observations made in May are not included, in consequence of the re-magnetising of the needle, as stated at the head of the Table of that month's observations.\n\nMonthly and general mean Intensities of the horizontal magnetic Needle for every hour.\n\n| Hour | February | March | April | May | General mean independent of May |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|-----|--------------------------------|\n| A.

M.; but the time of minimum intensity is not so well defined, although it seems to happen somewhat later in the morning.",
