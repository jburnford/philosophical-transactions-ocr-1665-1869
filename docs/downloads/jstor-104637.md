The Sun pass'd the Meridian.
A sensible Penumbra.
Eclipse begins.
Shadow touches Tycho.
Tycho half covered.
Tycho covered.
Tycho begins to be uncovered.
Tycho half uncovered.
Tycho quite uncovered.
Eclipse ends.
Penumbra gone.
Moon's Center pass'd the Meridian.
Sirius pass'd, his Mean Right Ascension being 98° 31' 38".
The Sun pass'd the Meridian.

The Appulses of the Shadow to the Spot Tycho were observed with a Reflecting Telescope, which magnified about 40 times, and may be serviceable for geographical Purposes. The Beginning and End of the Eclipse were estimated by the bare Eye, and a Refracting Telescope of a small magnifying Power; larger Powers being apt to dilute the Shadow too much, and thereby render these Phases more uncertain.

A Computation by Dr. Halley's Tables gave the Beginning

Apparent Time:

End: 9 14 58
