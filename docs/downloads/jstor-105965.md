XXXIX. Observations of the Sun's Eclipse, 16th of August, 1765, taken at Caen in Normandy. By Nathanael Pigott, Esquire, of Whitton, in Middlesex. Communicated by J. Bevis, M. D. F. R. S.

Tr. Time.

At 3 57 28 the seg. of the sun's illum. diam. meaf. 29 38 14
4 8 52 the distance of the horns ditto 14 47 37
4 18 39 the seg. of the illuminated diam. ditto 27 4 35
4 24 28 the distance of the horns ditto 16 20 24
4 35 47 the seg. of the illuminated diam. ditto 27 14 14
4 43 4 the distance of the horns ditto 14 26 6
4 52 38 the seg. of the illuminated diam. ditto 29 52 1
4 56 54 the distance of the horns ditto 7 46 4

Sun's incl. diam. meaf. at 3 19 38 31 45 11
Ditto at 3 22 10 31 42 58
Sun's horiz. diam. aft. at 5 31 33 31 41 29
the Eclipse 31 43 20
Sun's inclined diam. at 3 53 37 31 43 42
meaf. August 15th of the Sun's diam. meaf.

Eclipse
Eclipse beg. tr. time at 3 48 16 hence the mid. was at 4 24 36
end. at 5 0 56½ and greatest phase obs. at 4 18 39
mid. at 4 24 36 whence the ecl. incr. for 5 57 of
dur. at 1 12 40½ time, in which the Sun's diam. illum. decreased 36″ 14″; therefore from the Sun's diam. illuminated at 4 18 39 = 27 4 35 take the decrease in + 5 57 = 0 36 14
the diam. of the Sun at the middle 4 24 36 = 26 28 21

which taken from the mean diam. meas. 31′ 43″ 20‴ gives 5 14 59
the quantity of the eclipse, or segment of the diameter eclipsed, which is 1 digit and 59′,15 of a digit, or $1 \frac{59}{60} = 2$ digits nearly. This eclipse was observed with an achromatic refractor of 6 feet, and a micrometer made by Dollond. The weather very fine.

The times, as computed from the Tables at the end of M. De la Lande's Astronomy.

| h ′ ″ | h ′ ″ | difference |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Beginning at 3 48 24,6 observ. at 3 48 16 | 0 8,6 |
| Middle 4 25 11,0 | 4 24 36 | 0 35,0 |
| End 5 1 57,2 | 5 0 56,5 | 1 0,7 |
| Duration 1 13 32,6 | 1 12 40,5 | 0 52,1 |

Also the latitude of the Moon was, by observation, 16″ greater than the tables gave it.
