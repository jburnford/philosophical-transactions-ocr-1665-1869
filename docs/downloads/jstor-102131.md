Of the weight of a cubic foot of divers grains, &c. try'd in a Vessel of well season'd Oak, whose concave was an exact cubic foot. By the direction of the Philosophicall Society of Oxford.

The following bodies were poured gently into the vessel, and those in the first 12 first Experiments were weighed in scales turning with 2 ounces, but the last 7 were weighed in scales turning with one ounce. The pounds, and ounces here mention'd are Avoirdupois.

2. Wheat of the best sort (worth 6½ a bushell.) 48. 4

3. The same sort of Wheat measured a 2d time. 48. 2

Both sorts were red lammas Wheat of the last year.

4. White Oats of the last year. 29. 8
