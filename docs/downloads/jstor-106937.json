By Colonel Edward Williams, Captain William Mudge, and Mr. Isaac Dalby. Communicated by the Duke of Richmond, F.R.S.\n\nRead May 11, 1797.\n\nPART FIRST.\n\nPREAMBLE.\n\nAccording to the resolution expressed in the account of the Trigonometrical Survey, printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1795, we now communicate to the public, through the same channel, a farther relation of its progress.\n\nOn referring to the above paper, it will be found that, for the prosecution of this undertaking, a design was formed of proceeding to the westward, with a series of triangles, for the survey of the coast. This intention has been carried into effect; and as the small theodolite, or circular instrument, announced in our former communication as then in the hands of Mr. Ramsden, was finished early in the summer of 1795, we are enabled to give a series of triangles, extending, in conjunction with those before given, from the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, to the Land's End.\n\nIn the composition of the following account, we have adhered to the plan adopted in the last, of giving the angles of\nthe great triangles, with their variations; and we have, with as much brevity as possible, inserted a narrative of each year's operations. This will be found, however, to extend only to the First Part, or that containing the particulars of the survey in which the great instrument alone was used. The remaining contents of this portion of the work, are necessarily confined to the angles of the principal, and secondary triangles, with the calculations of their sides, in feet; and likewise such data as have no connection with the computations of latitudes and longitudes.\n\nPart the Second contains an account of a survey carried on in Kent, in the years 1795 and 1796, with the small instrument, by order of the Master General, for completing a map of the eastern and southern parts of that county, for the use of the Board of Ordnance, and the military commanders on the coast.\n\nIn Part the First will be found an article, for which we are indebted to Dr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal. It contains his demonstration of M. de Lambre's formula, in the Connoissance des Temps of 1793, for reducing a distance on the sphere to any great circle near it, or the contrary. The practical rule thence derived, for reducing the angles in the plane of the horizon, to those formed by the chords, is very useful, and will considerably abridge the trouble which must necessarily arise in computing the chord corrections by any former method.\nSECTION FIRST.\n\nARTICLE I. Of Particulars relating to the Operations of the Year 1795.\n\nIn an early part of this season, from the necessity which existed of completing the map of Kent, mentioned in the preamble, we had conceived that our former intentions, of continuing the survey towards the west, would for the present be relinquished; as it was not imagined that the telescope of the small circular instrument, then in the hands of Mr. Ramsden, could be applied, with good effect, in observing staffs erected on very distant stations.\n\nFrom the obvious importance, however, of adhering to the first resolution, it was determined that a trial should be made of the excellence of this instrument, in the construction of which extraordinary pains had been taken, by operating with it in Kent, and using it for those purposes to which, if the object before spoken of had not been in view, the great theodolite would have been necessarily applied.\n\nThis smaller theodolite, therefore, as a substitute, was in May taken into Kent by Mr. Dalby, and Mr. Gardner, chief draughtsman in the Tower; the assistance of the former being necessary, as the stations in the series of 1787 were for the most part unknown to the latter gentleman.\n\nAs the former paper, relating to the trigonometrical survey, could not be presented to the Royal Society before the 4th of June, the business did not commence till the 12th of the same month. The party then left London, and the instrument was taken to Bull Barrow, in Dorsetshire.\nOn a reference to the account of 1795, it will be seen, that a station was chosen near Lulworth, and observed both from Nine Barrow Down and Black Down. It was also intended to be observed from Bull Barrow; by which means the great triangle, formed by the stations Black Down, Nine Barrow Down, and Bull Barrow, would be divided into, and made to consist of, two smaller triangles. This, however, it was now found could not be done, as a signal house had been erected near the station at Lulworth, subsequent to the operations in 1794, which prevented that spot from being afterwards seen at Bull Barrow: but no consequences very injurious can have arisen from the impracticability of making use of this station in the manner originally proposed, since the stations formerly chosen in Portland, with which that of Lulworth was also intended to connect, have not been visited with the instrument. The stations in that island were selected with a view of observing from them, and Charton Common, some point in the vicinity of Torbay, which might be a proper station in the series intended to be carried along the coast. Such a situation, however, could not be conveniently found, as the view of Devonshire from Charton Common is much interrupted by trees and other obstacles; and it would have been highly improper to shorten the side between Pilsden Hill and the coast, by choosing a station more remote from the latter than Charton Common.\n\nAs from an inspection of the plan of the triangles annexed to this account, a doubt may be entertained as to the propriety of carrying on so very extensive a series from the short side connecting the stations on Black Down and Mintern Hill; it must be observed that, admitting the necessity of adopting Bull Barrow for a station, those on Pilsden and Mintern Hills were\nnaturally chosen; the first, because it connected with Dumpdon (a station that could not be dispensed with); and the second, because it was the point most remote from Black Down, being on the brow of the high land overlooking the general surface of Somersetshire.\n\nTo connect with the station formerly chosen near Maiden Bradley, two others were selected whilst the party were at Bull Barrow; one on Ash Beacon, near Sherborne, and the other on the Quantock Hills. Both these have very commanding views, and will hereafter easily unite with any stations which may be chosen to the northward.\n\nFrom Bull Barrow, the instrument was successively taken to the following stations, before any other new ones were chosen, vi. Mintern, Pilsden, and Charton Common; and whilst the party were at the latter, nearly all the stations were selected in Devonshire. In the choice of these, much difficulty occurred, as the face of this county is particularly unfavourable for operations of this kind. Around Honiton and Chard, there are several small ranges of hills, nearly of an equal height, running in parallel directions. Near the former are three, thus circumstanced; viz. Hembury Fort, Combe Raleigh, and Dumpdon. From the first and second of these, the station on Charton Common is not visible; and it is from the last only, that both Pilsden and the Quantock Hills can be seen. This station, however, has a disadvantage: Combe Raleigh, which is to the west of it, takes off all view round Tiverton and Silferton; so that it became indispensably necessary to select a spot on the northern extremity of Dartmoor, called Cawsand Beacon.\n\nTo those who are acquainted with the interior of Dartmoor,\nit will be unnecessary to assign the reason for not having chosen any station towards its centre. It may be sufficient to observe, that two spots were found on its circumference, which render the want of it trifling in its consequences.\n\nIndependent of the stations to which, as we have before observed, the instrument was taken this year, the following were visited, viz. Dumpdon, Little Haldon, Furland, and Butterton. From the latter, the party returned to London in the month of October.\n\n**ART. II.

III. Of Particulars relating to the Operations of the Year 1796.\n\nIn the account of this Survey, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795, page 473, it is stated, that large stones were sunk in the ground at the extremities of the base of verification on Salisbury Plain. To render these points permanent, two iron cannon (selected from among the unserviceable ordnance in Woolwich Warren) were, towards the end of February, sent to Salisbury, and in the beginning of March inserted at the ends of the base. The same methods were adopted, for the purpose of fixing these cannon in their proper positions, as those made use of when similar termini were sunk in the ground on Hounslow Heath. This operation having been completed on the 10th of March, the instrument was shortly after carried to Kit Hill, in Cornwall; a station, like that on Bindown, chosen rather for the purpose of a secondary, than a principal place of observation.\n\nIt would be tedious, and perhaps unnecessary, to enumerate the names of all the stations selected this year, as many of them do not form any part of the series now given to the public. We shall, therefore, confine ourselves to such remarks on the subject as may serve to abridge this article.\n\nWe have before stated, that a station was chosen on Cawsand Beacon, the northern extremity of Dartmoor, for the purpose of connecting with Dumpdon. It should have been observed, that to the westward of the former eminence, and near it, there is a hill considerably higher, which in point of situation has many advantages, but which cannot be made\nuse of on account of the ruggedness of its surface, which seems to render the carrying of the instrument to its top almost impossible. From this circumstance, and similar impediments, which the high lands remote from the circumference of Dartmoor offer to our operations, it results, that the body of this moor cannot have any great triangles carried over it: such stations were therefore selected this year as may serve, in conjunction with others, to include this tract of country in a polygon of a small number of sides.\n\nTo make observations for the purpose of hereafter determining the longitude and latitude of the Lizard, was a principal object in this year's operations; and as this headland seems to offer itself as very convenient for a station, it will be right to assign our reasons for not having chosen one upon it.\n\nAs no other spot but Hensbarrow Beacon could be found in that part of Cornwall proper for a station, it became necessary to fix on the Deadman, or Dodman, for another point in the series. From this place no part of the land within four miles of the Lizard can be seen, as the high ground about Black Head, which is to the eastward of the latter, is nearly in a line between them, and is also much higher than both. It will be perceived, however, that no evil can result from the want of such a station, as the light-houses and the naval-signal-staff at the Lizard, have been intersected from several stations. The precise spot on which Mr. Bradley made his observations in the year 1769, for ascertaining the longitude and latitude of this headland, was pointed out by the person having the care of the light-houses, who well remembered the common particulars relating to his operations: such measurements were made from the light-houses to this spot, as may enable us, at a future\nperiod, to compare the results from the data afforded by the trigonometrical operation, with those deduced from the astronomical observations made by the above gentleman. It may be also mentioned, that angles were at the same time taken at the western light-house and signal-staff, for the purpose of finding the situation of the Lizard Point.\n\nWe are now to speak of the most important business performed this year; that of making observations to determine the distance of the Scilly Isles from the Land’s End.\n\nTo do this as accurately as possible, it became necessary to find stations affording the longest base. The hill near Rosemergy, called the Watch, and the station near St. Buryan, are certainly the most advantageous places, because all the islands can be seen from both; but we could not avail ourselves of the former, as difficulties almost insuperable would have attended an attempt to get the instrument upon it. Another station was therefore selected, on Karnminnis, near St. Ives; a spot as well situated as the place spoken of, provided all the islands could be seen: this, however, does not prove to be the case, St. Martin’s Day-Mark being the only object in the Scilly Islands visible from Karnminnis.\n\nFrom the stations near the Land’s End (Sennen and Pertinney), as well as that above mentioned (St. Buryan), St. Agnes’ Light-house, and two objects in St. Mary’s, were observed; and as the means by which all their distances are determined, except those of the Day-Mark, from the shortness of the bases (which were, however, the longest that could be found) are exceptionable, it will be right to mention, that while we were engaged in that part of the operation now spoken of, the air was so unusually clear, that we could sometimes, with the\ntelescope of the great theodolite, discover the soldiers at exercise in St. Mary's island.\n\nUnder this article, it will be convenient to state, that we have endeavoured to find some spot to the westward, on which a base might be measured. Had we been fortunate in this respect, it undoubtedly would be eminently advantageous; as those triangles, now extended to the Land's End, would, in that case, be verified in some part of the new series. In Devonshire and Cornwall, however, no place has been discovered by any means fit for the purpose; so that our communicating this work, under the circumstances attending it, is a matter of necessity.\n\nIn the present and former seasons, such stations were selected and observed, as were judged to be proper for the future use of the small instrument; and as we had experienced, in the early stage of this Survey, much delay and disappointment from the white lights not being always seen when fired on distant stations, we have since substituted lamps and staffs in their stead. The operations of the present year were continued till October, when the party returned to London.\n\nART. IV.

To the constant logarithm \\(5,0134\\) add \\(L \\cdot t', \\frac{1}{2}a\\), and \\(L \\cdot vs, \\frac{1}{2}D \\sim d\\), the sum diminished by \\(20\\) in the index, is the logarithm of the second part in seconds, which is always affirmative. These two joined together, according to their proper signs, will give the approximate value of \\(da\\). To its logarithmic versed sine, add \\(L \\cdot t', a\\) and constant logarithm \\(5,3144\\), the sum, diminished by \\(20\\) in the index, will be the logarithm of the third part in seconds, which will be negative or affirmative, according as \\(a\\) is less or more than \\(90^\\circ\\). This applied according to its sign, to the...\"\nThe Account of a\n\n\"approximate value of \\(d_a\\), will give the correct value of \\(d_a\\).\n\"If the third part comes out considerable, it should be com-\n\"puted anew with the last value of \\(d_a\\). The value of \\(d_a\\),\n\"finally corrected, applied to \\(a\\), will give A, the angle between\n\"the chords.\"\n\nIn the application of the above rule, to the computation of\nsuch corrections as may be applied to the angles of any tri-\nangles in this survey, it is manifest that the last step may be\nentirely neglected on account of the smallness of the approxi-\nmate value of \\(d_a\\), whose versed sine is one of the arguments.\nBeing, therefore, confined to the use of the two first steps, the\noperation is very short. An example is here given in the com-\nputation of the correction for reducing the angle at Chancton-\nbury Ring in the 39th triangle, given in the last account (see\nPhil. Trans. for 1795, p. 492), to that formed by the chords.\n\nEXAMPLE.\n\n| Constant logarithm | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n|-------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Log. tang. \\(\\frac{1}{2}a = 78^\\circ 56'\\) | 10,7112 | Log. co. tang. \\(\\frac{1}{2}a\\) | - | - | - | - |\n| Log. vs. \\(\\frac{1}{2}H + b = 19' 53''5\\) | 5,2237 | Log. vs. \\(\\frac{1}{2}H - b = 5' 53''5\\) | 4,1669 |\n| 0,9483 + 8\",88 | - | 2,4690 + 0\",03 |\n\n1st correction = 8\",88\n2d correction + 0\",03\n\n= 8\",85 the correction required.\n**Trigonometrical Survey.**\n\n**SECTION SECOND.**\n\n*Calculation of the Sides of the great Triangles, carried on from the Termination of the Series, published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Year 1795, along the Coasts of Dorsetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall, to the Land's End.*\n\nDistance from Wingreen to Nine Barrow Down, 130224.5 Feet (see Phil.

from taking the means of the several observations: and the same rules have been adopted for their corrections, which were laid down in the account of the trigonometrical operation, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. The angle at Blackdown in the XLVII. triangle (for the triangles of the present series are numbered in order from those of the former), is considered to be nearly 2\" in defect, and has been augmented for calculation accordingly: the angle at that station was observed under circumstances less favourable, than those which attended the observations made on Pilsden, and Charton Common.\nSECTION THIRD.\n\nHeights of the Stations.

Reduce the elevations, or depressions, to the place of the axis of the telescope at each station, by adding, or subtracting, as the case may require, the angle at the place of observation, subtended by the vertical height between the object, whose elevation or depression was observed, and the axis of the telescope when at that station.*\n\n2. Then, if both are depressions, subtract their sum from the contained arc, and half the remainder is the mean refraction.\n\n3. If one is a depression and the other an elevation, take their difference. Then, if the depression is greater than the elevation, subtract the difference from the contained arc, and half the remainder is the mean refraction. But if the elevation is greatest, add the difference to the contained arc, and half the sum is the mean refraction.\n\nART. III.

At the station on Hensbarrow, the ground at Bodmin Down was depressed $31' 27''$: the distance of those stations is 47337 feet; and the axis of the telescope was $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet above the ground: therefore, as $47337 : \\text{radius} :: 5\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ feet} : \\text{tang. } 24''$ the angle subtended by $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet at that distance; which, taken from $31' 27''$, gives $31' 3''$ for the depression of the place of the axis, instead of the ground. Again, at Bodmin Down, the ground at Hensbarrow was elevated $23' 57''$, to which adding $24''$, we have $24' 21''$ for the elevation of the place of the axis.\n### Trigonometrical Survey\n\n| Stations          | Heights |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Butterton         | 1203 feet |\n| Maker Heights     | 402     |\n| Bull Barrow       | 927     |\n| Mintern Hill      | 891     |\n| Pilsden Hill      | 934     |\n| Dumpdon           | 879     |\n| Cawsand Beacon    | 1792    |\n| Bolt Head         | 430     |\n| Kit Hill          | 1067    |\n| Bindown           | 658     |\n| Carraton Hill     | 1208    |\n| Lansallos         | 514     |\n| Bodmin Down       | 649     |\n| Hensbarrow Beacon | 1026    |\n| The Deadman       | 379     |\n| St. Agnes' Beacon | 599     |\n| Karnbonellis      | 822     |\n| Karnminnis        | 805     |\n| St. Buryan        | 415     |\n\n**ART. IV. Remarks, &c. on the foregoing Table.**\n\nThe height of the ground at the station on Maker Heights, 402 feet, was determined by levelling down to low-water mark, near the passage house, below Mount Edgcumbe, on April 15, 1796. This, however, had been done several years before, by some officers of the Royal Engineers, who found it to be 401 feet. The height of the station near Dunnose, in the Isle of Wight, was also found by levelling; of which an account is given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. It therefore\nmay be considered as the least exceptionable mode of procedure, to deduce the intermediate heights from both those stations; for which purpose, the following comparison was made, exhibiting the height of the station on Charton Common, both ways.\n\nHeight of Nine Barrow Down (Phil. Trans. 1795, p. 582) 642\nof Black Down - - - - 825\nof Charton Common, deduced from the height of Dunnose - - - - 597\n\nHeight of Butterton - - - - 1201\nof Rippin Tor - - - - 1545\nof Furland - - - - 585\nof Haldon - - - - 811\nof Charton Common, deduced from the height of Maker - - - - 568\nfrom that of Dunnose 597\n\ndifference 29\n\nThose are the heights resulting directly from the observations. Now, supposing the difference, or the errors, to arise from the mean refractions, and those errors to be nearly the same between every two stations, we shall obtain the corrected heights in the following manner:\n\nNine Barrow Down 642 - 4 = 638\nBlack Down 825 - 8 = 817\nCharton Common 597 - 15 = 582\nButterton - 1201 + 2 = 1203\nRippin Tor 1545 + 4 = 1549\nHaldon - 811 + 7 = 818\nCharton Common 568 + 14 = 582\n\nas in the table.\nFrom those corrected heights, the others to the northward have been deduced. The heights to the westward of Butterton were determined from that of Maker. A mean of two or three results, by using $\\frac{1}{15}$ of the contained arcs for refraction, is taken for the height of the station on Mintern Hill.\n\nWe subjoin the following elevations and depressions, for the use of those who may wish to examine the tables of heights and refractions, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. And here it is to be noted, that the axis of the telescope was always about $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the ground, unless the contrary is specified.\n\n**At Hanger Hill.**\n\nThe ground at St. Ann’s Hill *depr.* $4^{\\circ}36'$\n\nat Banstead *elev.* $10^{\\circ}39'$\n\n**At St. Ann’s Hill.**\n\nThe ground at Bagshot Heath *elev.* $11^{\\circ}23'$\n\nat Banstead *elev.* $10^{\\circ}2'$\n\nat Hanger Hill *depr.* $6^{\\circ}13'$\n\nThe top of the flagstaff near Hampton Poor House *depr.* $12^{\\circ}54'$\n\nN.

It may be proper to observe, that the Eddystone Light-house is nearer to the Rame-head than to any other point on the coast.\n\n**ART. III.

Computing with this distance, and also that from the Western Light-house to the same station, with the observed angle 0° 31' 8'', we get 1857 feet for the distance between those objects.\nFor the purpose of ascertaining the situation of the Lizard Point, two angles in the following triangle were observed with a sextant, viz.\n\n| Naval-Signal-staff | - | 77° 4' |\n|-------------------|---|--------|\n| Western Light-house | - | 60° 50' |\n\n**Lizard Point**\n\nThese, with the computed distance from the Signal-staff to the Light-house, give the distance of the Lizard Point from the Signal-staff \\(2419\\) feet. Hence, the distance of the point from the station on Karnbonellis is \\(81085\\) feet, the angle at that station, between the Lizard Point and Western Light-house, being \\(1° 53' 47''\\). With respect to the means by which the situation of the spot, on which Mr. Bradley erected his observatory in 1769, may hereafter be determined, it will be readily understood from the following diagram; where E is the Eastern Light-house, W the Western Light-house, F the Signal-staff, P the Lizard Point, and O the place of the Observatory.

We may presume, therefore, that had not the Day-Mark been seen from Karnminnis, but from Sennen and Pertinney alone, the observations from which the angles of the 311th triangle are derived, would have afforded the means of computing the distance with sufficient precision. In like manner the 312th and 313th triangles seem to prove, that the observations made to St. Agnes’ Light-house were sufficiently accurate, as there is a difference only of 16 feet between the distances of the Light-house from Pertinney. The ball on the top of the Light-house was the object always observed; and the Day-Mark being pyramidal, we had the means of making the observations at the different stations to the same point of this building.\nART. V. Of the Distances of the Objects in the Scilly Isles, (intersected from the Stations in the West of Cornwall) from Sennen Steeple; the Stone near the Land’s End; and the Longship’s Light-house.\n\nAs the observations made to the Day Mark, and St. Agnes’ Light-house, may be supposed sufficiently accurate; and the ball on the top of the Longship’s Light-house was also observed under favourable circumstances, it will be proper to apply the corrections to the horizontal angles, in order to obtain those formed by the chords. Taking, therefore, Pertinney as the angular point, and computing with the following data, viz.\n\nStation on Pertinney from - \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Day-Mark} & = 154551 \\text{ Feet.} \\\\\n\\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 182207 \\\\\n\\text{Longship’s Light-house} & = 27883\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthe angle at Pertinney, augmented for calculation, between the Longship’s Light-house and the Longship’s Light-house from -\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{the Day-Mark} & = 12° 17' 30'' \\\\\n\\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 6° 15' 25''\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe get the distance of\n\nCalculating also, with the distances of the two other objects in the Scilly Isles, and likewise those of Sennen Steeple, and the Stone near the Land’s End from Pertinney, with the included angles at the same station, we get\n\nSennen Steeple from -\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Day Mark} & = 139521 = 26,43 \\text{ Miles.} \\\\\n\\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 166255 = 31,49 \\\\\n\\text{Flagstaff in St. Mary’s} & = 157912 = 29,95 \\\\\n\\text{Windmill in St. Mary’s} & = 155299 = 29,41\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nStone near the Land’s End from -\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Day Mark} & = 135343 = 25,63 \\\\\n\\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 162100 = 30,7 \\\\\n\\text{Flagstaff in St. Mary’s} & = 153744 = 29,11 \\\\\n\\text{Windmill in St. Mary’s} & = 151138 = 28,63\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nOf the Scilly Isles, Menawthen is the nearest to the Land's End, being about $1\\frac{2}{15}$ miles eastward of the Day-Mark; and the cluster of rocks, called the Bishop and his Clerks, the most remote, being $3\\frac{1}{3}$ miles west of St. Agnes' Light-house. Combining, therefore, the above particulars with those distances, we may conclude, that the nearest part of the Scilly Isles is about $24.7$ miles from the Land's End, and the farthest nearly $34$.\n\nPART SECOND.\n\nSECTION I.\n\nAccount of a Trigonometrical Survey carried on in Kent, in the Years 1795, and 1796, with the small circular Instrument.\n\nARTICLE I. Particulars respecting the Instrument.\n\nThe instrument used in this survey was announced in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795, p. 590. It was made by Mr. Ramsden; and is about half the size of his large theodolite, or circular instrument, with which we take the horizontal angles, but nearly similar to it in all its parts; consequently a very brief description will be sufficient.\n\nThe most material variations in the construction are,\n\n1. The levelling or feet screws. These are below that horizontal movement which serves to direct the lower telescope to any particular object. By this position of the screws, the horizontal circle being once made level, the whole instrument may be moved round without disturbing its horizontality; the levelling screws remaining stationary during that operation,\nwhich cannot be done in the large instrument, because the screws are carried round with it.\n\n2. The diameter of the horizontal circle being only half that of the larger one, it follows, that the space between any two dots on the limb, gives double the number of minutes that are contained in the same space on the greater circle: on this account, each revolution in the micrometer screw in the microscope answers to $2'$; and the circle on the microscopic micrometer being divided into 60 parts, each division becomes equal to $2''$, but for the conveniency of notation, they are numbered at every 5th, with 10, 20, &c. to 50, the 60th being marked 1, to denote $1'$: the number of seconds then commencing as before, the whole revolution becomes $2'$. The revolutions are counted by means of notches on one side of the field in the microscope, in the same manner as in those of the large instrument.\n\n3. This instrument not being intended for determining the direction of the meridian, a vertical semicircle for directing the telescope to the pole star became unnecessary; yet some apparatus was required, whereby small elevations or depressions from the horizon might be ascertained with a tolerable degree of precision. For this purpose, a moveable index, of about four inches long, is made to turn on the horizontal axis of the upper telescope, and so constructed, that by means of a finger screw, it can be fixed firmly in any position. The lower end of this index is furnished with a steel micrometer screw, having a circle on its head, divided into 100 parts, for shewing the fractional parts of a revolution, while other divisions, on a chamfered edge of the index which marks the fractional parts, give the number of revolutions made by the micrometer screw.\nThe method of finding the value of a revolution of the micrometer head in parts of a degree, &c. was as follows:\n\nA rod, 14 or 16 feet long, was placed horizontally about three quarters of a mile off, and the angle subtended by its ends measured with the instrument in the usual way: the rod was then set up perpendicular at the same place, and the cross wires in the telescope directed to one of its extremities: the telescope was then moved in the vertical plane, by means of the micrometer screw, till the cross wires coincided with the other extremity. In this manner, by counting the number of revolutions, &c. necessary to move the telescope from one position to the other, an angle was measured vertically with the micrometer screw, equal to the former horizontal angle. From repeated trials, the value of a revolution was found equal to $10' 27''$.\n\nThis instrument, on account of its portable size, may very readily be taken to the tops of steeples, towers, &c. and is, therefore, extremely well adapted to the uses for which it was intended.\n\nART. II. Situations of the Stations on which Observations were made with the small circular Instrument, in the Summer of the Year 1795.\n\nFolkstone Turnpike, the station made use of by General Roy in 1787.\n\nHawkinge, about three quarters of a mile from Folkstone Turnpike. This station was chosen for the purpose of having a view of the Belvidere in Waldershare Park, which cannot be seen from the station of 1787.\nThe Account of a\n\nDover Castle.\n\nPaddlesworth; about 400 feet from the station of 1787. This new spot was selected, because Hardres Steeple is not visible from the old station.\n\nWaldershare; on the Belvidere in the Earl of Guilford's Park.\n\nOn Ringswold Steeple.\n\nOn a sand hill near the sea shore, between Deal and Ramsgate: this station is denominated Shore.\n\nNear Mount Pleasant House, Isle of Thanet.\n\nOn a rising ground near Wingham.\n\nOn Chislet Steeple.\n\nIn Beverley Park, near Canterbury.\n\nOn Upper Hardres Steeple.\n\nART. III. Triangles for determining the Distances of the Stations.\n\nAs the station on the Keep of Dover Castle, in 1787, was directly over the steps of the Turret, a new point was chosen about $6\\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the former, where the instrument could stand conveniently: this new point is about 2,8 feet farther from Folkestone Turnpike, and 1 foot farther from Paddlesworth, than the point marking the old station.\n\nFrom General Roy's Account of the Trigonometrical Survey in 1787, we have\n\nDover Castle from Folkestone Turnpike $31554_{6}$ feet.\nfrom Paddlesworth $42561_{2}$ feet.\n\nNow, augmenting those distances in the proportion of 141747 to 141753 (see Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX, p. 595, and the Vol.\nfor 1795, p. 508), we get 31556, and 42563 feet; to which adding 2,8, and 1, respectively, we have\n\nThe new point on Dover Castle from Folkstone\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Turnpike} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 31558.8 \\\\\n\\text{from Paddlesworth} & \\quad 42564\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nfeet.\n\nIn order to obtain the distance between Waldershare and Dover Castle from those new sides, or distances, the three angles of the following triangle were very carefully taken.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 \\quad \\text{Dover Castle} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 3 \\quad 49 \\quad 16 \\quad 3 \\quad 49 \\quad 15 \\\\\n\\text{Folkstone Turnpike} & \\quad 36 \\quad 6 \\quad 31 \\quad 36 \\quad 6 \\quad 30 \\\\\n\\text{Hawkinge} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 140 \\quad 4 \\quad 16 \\quad 140 \\quad 4 \\quad 15\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nfor computation.\n\nThe third angles of the two next triangles were not observed:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 \\quad \\text{Hawkinge} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 44 \\quad 23 \\quad 30 \\\\\n\\text{Dover Castle} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 73 \\quad 53 \\quad 44 \\\\\n\\text{Waldershare} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 61 \\quad 42 \\quad 46\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3 \\quad \\text{Dover Castle} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 62 \\quad 24 \\quad 7 \\\\\n\\text{Paddlesworth (the station of 1787)} & \\quad 32 \\quad 36 \\quad 9 \\\\\n\\text{Waldershare} & \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad - \\quad 84 \\quad 59 \\quad 44.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBy the two first triangles, Dover Castle from Waldershare\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Feet.} & \\quad 23019.4 \\quad 23020.5 \\quad \\text{mean distance.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom the latter\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\quad 23021.5\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd Hawkinge from\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Dover Castle} & \\quad 28976 \\\\\n\\text{Waldershare} & \\quad 31616\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nN.

V. Triangles carried over another Part of Kent in 1795; with Remarks.\n\nOn account of the high woody lands to the westward of Hardres and Paddlesworth, the triangles could not be extended in that direction, and therefore the following may be considered as a detached part of the Survey this year.\n\nThe Stations were,\n\nWestwell Down,\nWye Down,\nBrabourn Down,\nAllington, or Aldington Knoll, the station of 1787.\n\nAllington Knoll from Tenterden, according to General Roy's account, is 61775.3 feet, which increased in the proportion of 141747 to 141753 becomes 61778 feet. The centre of the top of Tenterden Steeple is about 4 or 4½ feet farther from Allington Knoll than the point marking the station in 1787; therefore the distance of the centre from Allington Knoll will be 61782 feet, which is used in the following computations; because, as a flagstaff of moderate height.\ncannot be easily distinguished among the pinnacles at any considerable distance, it was thought it might be sufficiently accurate for the present purpose, to intersect the steeple itself.\n\n**Triangles for determining the Distances of the Stations.**\n\n| No. | Stations          | Observed angles | Distances                  | Feet. |\n|-----|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------|\n| 62  | Allington Knoll   | 61° 37' 46\"     | Westwell D. from Tenterden | 58629 |\n|     | Westwell Down     | 68° 0' 16\"      | Allington K.               | 51316 |\n|     | Tenterden         | 50° 21' 58\"     |                            |       |\n| 63  | Allington Knoll   | 34° 37' 37\"     | Wye Down                   | 37363 |\n|     | Westwell Down     | 45° 54' 19\"     | Allington K.               |       |\n|     | Wye Down          | 99° 28' 5\"      | Westwell D.                | 29562 |\n|     |                   | 180° 0' 1\"      |                            |       |\n| 64  | Allington Knoll   | 96° 15' 23\"     | Wye Down                   | 37360 |\n|     | Wye Down          | 54° 19' 24\"     | Allington K.               |       |\n|     | Tenterden         | 29° 25' 13\"     | Tenterden                  | 75603 |\n| 65  | Wye Down          | 45° 8' 41\"      | Westwell D. from Wye D.    | 29566 |\n|     | Westwell Down     | 113° 54' 35\"    |                            |       |\n|     | Tenterden         | 20° 56' 44\"     |                            |       |\n| 66  | Allington Knoll   | 116° 49' 40\"    | Brabourn D.                | 26437 |\n|     | Brabourn Down     | 45° 25' 31\"     | Allington K.               |       |\n|     | Tenterden         | 17° 44' 49\"     | Tenterden                  | 77397 |\n| 67  | Allington Knoll   | 55° 11' 54\"     | Brabourn D.                | 42233 |\n|     | Brabourn Down     | 93° 52' 23\"     | Westwell D.                |       |\n|     | Westwell Down     | 3° 55' 43\"      | Allington K.               | 26435 |\n## ART.

Section I.\n\nPart Second.\n\nSilver Hill, near Robertsbridge. The station is 22 yards S.W. of the Windmill.\n\nBoughton Malherb Steeple.\n\nART. II. Triangles for finding the Distances of the Stations.\n\nFrom the 5th Article in the last Section, we get the distance from Westwell Down to the new station on Tenterden Steeple = 58629.4 feet. This used in the following triangle,\n\n| Boughton Malherb | 81 55 9 |\n|------------------|---------|\n| Westwell Down    | 63 44 8 |\n| Tenterden        | 34 20 43 |\n\ngives the distance from Boughton Malherb to Westwell Down 33409 feet. Also in the following triangle, using 54376.9 feet for the distance from Tenterden to Goudhurst,\n\n| Goudhurst       | 52 5 44 |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Boughton Malherb| 53 54 20 |\n| Tenterden       | 75 59 56 |\n\nMDCCXCVII.\nwe get $33404.5$ feet for the distance between the same stations; hence the mean, $33406.8$ feet, may be taken for the true distance between Boughton Malherb and Westwell Down. From this latter triangle also, we obtain the distance from Boughton Malherb to Tenterden $53097.6$ feet.\n\n| No. | Triangles | Observed angles | Distances |\n|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------|\n|     |           |                 | Feet.    |\n| 86  | Goudhurst | $6^°\\ 29'\\ 7''$ |          |\n|     | Silver Hill| $70^°\\ 32'\\ 26''$ | Silver Hill from Goudhurst | $40043.1$ |\n|     | Tenterden | $43^°\\ 58'\\ 27''$ |          |\n\nFairlight Down from Tenterden $71637.7$ feet.\n\n| No. | Triangles | Observed angles | Distances |\n|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------|\n|     |           |                 | Feet.    |\n| 87  | Fairlight Down | $46^°\\ 34'\\ 5''$ |          |\n|     | Silver Hill | $82^°\\ 25'\\ 8''$ | Silver Hill from Fairlight D. | $56174.2$ |\n|     | Tenterden | $51^°\\ 0'\\ 47''$ |          |\n\nBy the two last triangles, we get $52472.4$ and $52481.4$ feet for the distances of Tenterden from Silver Hill; the mean of which, $52476.9$, we shall hereafter use in determining the distances of the objects, intersected from those stations.\n\nThe distance of Goudhurst from Tenterden, and that of Tenterden from Fairlight Down, are derived from those given by General Roy, in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LXXX. augmented in the proportion of $141747$ to $141753$. The distances also, hereafter made use of, between Lydd, and the stations on Fairlight Down, Tenterden Steeple, Allington Knoll, and High Nook, together with that of High Nook from Allington Knoll, are obtained by increasing the distances, found in the same work, in the above proportion. It is proper to\nremark, that it has not been thought necessary to reduce the distance between the station on Westwell Down, and the new station on Tenterden Steeple, to that between the former, and the old point at Tenterden, from the trifling difference of those distances.\n\nDuring the operation of this year, the instrument was also taken to the following stations, viz.\n\nBidenden Steeple,\nHartridge,\nWarehorn Steeple,\nStone Crouch,\nIden Steeple.\n\nTo determine the distances between these objects, and the stations from whence they were observed, we have the following triangles.\n\n| No. | Triangles.          | Observed angles. | Distances of the stations from the intersected objects. |\n|-----|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| 88  | Goudhurst -        | 18° 16' 4\"       | Bidenden Steeple {                                    |\n|     | Tenterden -        | 40° 0' 12\"       | Feet.                                                 |\n|     | Bidenden Steeple   |                  | 41100                                                  |\n|     |                    |                  | 20040                                                  |\n| 89  | Goudhurst -        | 27° 21' 34\"      | Hartridge {                                            |\n|     | Tenterden -        | 13° 14' 13\"      | Feet.                                                 |\n|     | Hartridge          |                  | 19134                                                  |\n|     |                    |                  | 38404                                                  |\n| 90  | Allington Knoll    | 44° 16' 25\"      | Stone Crouch {                                         |\n|     | Lydd -             | 73° 7' 50\"       | Feet.                                                 |\n|     | Stone Crouch       |                  | 51569                                                  |\n|     |                    |                  | 37627                                                  |\n| 91  | Allington Knoll    | 15° 46' 51\"      | Warehorn {                                             |\n|     | Stone Crouch       | 17° 18' 22\"      | Feet.                                                 |\n|     | Warehorn           |                  | 28100                                                  |\n|     |                    |                  | 25690                                                  |\n| No. | Triangles,          | Observed angles. | Distances of the stations from the intersected objects. |\n|-----|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|     |                    |                  | Feet.                                                  |\n| 92  | Tenterden -        | 28° 55' 46\"      | Iden Steeple                                           |\n|     | Fairlight Down -   | 20° 42' 7\"       |                                                        |\n|     | Iden Steeple       |                  |                                                        |\n|     |                    |                  | 33239                                                  |\n|     |                    |                  | 45483                                                  |\n|     |                    |                  |                                                        |\n| ART.

Bearings and Distances, 1795.\n\nAt Folkstone turnpike, the bearing of the station on Dover Castle in 1787, from the parallel to the meridian of Greenwich is $65^\\circ 52' 46''$ N E (See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX, page 603). The new point on the Keep is $6\\frac{1}{2}$ feet north-eastward from the old one, which will subtend an angle at Folkstone turnpike of about $38''$; therefore the new station bears $65^\\circ 52' 8''$ N E. The bearing of the centre of Tenterden Steeple from Allington Knoll, is nearly the same as that of the station in 1787, or $85^\\circ 47' 25''$ S W.: but the distances of those stations (Folkstone turnpike and Allington Knoll, see page 232 of the same Volume), from the meridian of Greenwich, and its perpendicular, are augmented in the proportion of $141747$ to $141753$, for obtaining the distances in the 3d and 4th columns of the following table: Folkstone turnpike being $274979$ and $137220$; and Allington Knoll $219935$ and $144038$ feet, respectively, from the meridian, and its perpendicular.\n\nMDCCXCVII.\n### Bearings and Distances of the Stations\n\n| Bearings from the Parallels to the Meridian of Greenwich | Distances from merid. | Distances from perp.

|\nCONCLUSION.\n\nThe account contained in the foregoing pages is presented in its present form, agreeable to the resolution expressed in our last communication. It is there stated, or rather implied, that, as materials are collected, details will meet the public eye through the medium of the Philosophical Transactions. The publishing of these particulars at periods not very remote from each other, will prove convenient, as we shall be enabled to communicate many data, which would be necessarily withheld, were these disclosures less frequent. It is on this account, that the particulars in Part the First do not contain the latitudes and longitudes of the stations, and objects intersected, as sufficient data have not yet been obtained for making the computations in an unexceptionable manner: but the contents of the Second Part are more complete, that Survey having been carried on in a country sufficiently near the meridian of Greenwich to give the necessary arguments with precision.\n\nIt is perhaps scarcely necessary to observe, that the design intended to be answered by an admission of the plans of the triangles annexed to this account, is to enable the reader to comprehend with ease the state of the operation, and to apply, without difficulty, the materials found in the body of the work to future Surveys. We have therefore, not attempted to delineate any varieties of ground in the plan of the western triangles (Tab. XI.): and it may, in this place, be proper to mention,\nthat the ranges of hills expressed in the plan found in our last account, were copied from authorities of the late Major General Roy. The map now given, of the operations performed in Kent (Tab. XII.), has the ground depicted in as accurate a manner as the scale will admit of, Mr. Gardner, from the minuteness of this Survey, being enabled to do it with accuracy.\n\nOn adverting to a principal object of this undertaking, that of preparing materials for correcting the geography of the country, it may be expected something should be said, respecting the accuracy of the maps of those counties in which our operations have been carried on. It is almost unnecessary to observe, that great correctness cannot result from the methods commonly taken in large surveys, which are usually made with an apparatus altogether unfit for measuring angles or bases with a sufficient degree of accuracy: and it will evidently appear, on applying the distances given in this, and our former paper, to those maps, that they are, generally, very defective. We must, however, observe, that Linley's and Crossley's Map of Surry, and Gardner's Map of Sussex, are the best which have yet fallen under our notice: the first is, in some measure, indebted for its excellence to the Trigonometrical Operation in 1787; and the latter to our own; as the distances between many stations, and the situations of many churches, in the southern, and western parts of Sussex, were given to Mr. Gardner prior to the publication of our last account. The geography of Devonshire and Dorsetshire is found particularly erroneous, as may be easily discovered by an application of our distances to the best maps of those counties.\nN. B. In Tab. XI. the triangles connecting the three principal objects in the Scilly Isles, and the stations from whence they were intersected, are laid down in that detached position to shorten the plan.\n\nErrata in the Account of the Survey, Philos.
