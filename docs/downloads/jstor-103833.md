3 Inches perpendicular Height, above the horizontal Plane on which the Meridian Line was drawn.

Mr. Wheeler, at Otterden-Place, near Lenham in Kent, observed the Beginning at $5^h\ 49'\ 0''$, and the End at $7^h\ 31'\ 49''$. His Observations were made with a Telescope of 15 Feet in length, and his Time was also rectified by a Meridian Line; but it was done by a Transit of the Rays through an Hole at a much greater Height. For the Brass Plate in which the Hole was made was fix'd to a Window in the Roof of his Hall, at the Height of 27 Feet above the Meridian Line on the Floor.

With my humble Duty to the Royal Society, I remain,

Sir,
Your humble Servant,
Stephen Gray.
