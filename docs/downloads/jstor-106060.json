It is migratory, arriving near Severn River in May, breeding on the coast, and then retiring to a warmer climate in autumn. It feeds on small birds; and, on the approach of any person, will fly in circles, making a hideous shrieking noise. The breast\nand belly are yellowish, with brown streaks, which are not mentioned by the ornithologists, though their descriptions answer in other respects. It weighs six ounces and a half, its length is $10\\frac{1}{2}$, the breadth $22\\frac{1}{2}$. Catesby's figure is a very indifferent one.\n\n**Falco**, 2. *Spadiceus*. New Species. Chocolate Falcon.

Its irides are yellow, and the legs blue. It comes nearest the *Sacre* of Brisson, Buffon, and Belon; but Buffon says it has black eyes, which is very indistinct; for the irides are black in none of the falcons, and in few other birds; and the pupil, if he means that, is black in all birds. It is said, by Belon, to come from Tartary and Russia, and is, therefore, probably a northern bird. It is very voracious and\nand bold, catching partridges out of a covey, which the Europeans are driving into their nests. It breeds in April and May. Its young are ready to fly in the middle of June. Its nests, as those of all other falcons, are built in unfrequented places; therefore, the author of the account from Severn River could not ascertain how many eggs it lays; however, the Indians told him it commonly lay two. It never migrates, and weighs $2\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds; its length is 22 inches, its breadth 3 feet.\n\n2. Strix, 14. Brachyotos. The short-eared Owl. Owl. Brit.

It answers the description and figure in the British Zoology; but its ears or long feathers do not appear. The smallness of the head has, probably, given occasion to call it a hawk, though it does not fly about in quest of prey, like other hawks (as the account from Severn River says); it sits quiet on the stumps of trees, waiting mice with all the attention of a domestic cat, being an inveterate enemy of those little animals. It migrates southward in autumn; and breeds along the coast. Its irides are yellow. Its weight is 14 ounces; its length 16 inches, the breadth 3 feet.\n\nStrix.\nStrix, 5. Nyctea. 132. 6. Snowy Owl.

The male, which in the class of birds of prey is generally smaller, is, however, in this species, larger than the female, according to the account from Severn River. Its colour is likewise much blacker, and the spots more distinct. The eyes are large and prominent; the irides of a bright yellow. The weight is 12 ounces; its length 17 inches, the breadth 2 feet. It has only two young at one hatching.\n\nStrix, 7. Passerina. 133. 12. Little Owl. Brit. Zool. Faun. Am.

Their eyes are black, and their feet of the same colour. Their characters correspond with the Linnean description. They breed early in spring; their nests are made of sticks and grass,\ngrafs, and built in pine trees; they have two, rarely three, young ones at a time; their eggs are blue; they fly in pairs; the male and female are perfectly alike; they feed on black moss, worms, and even flesh. When near habitations or tents, they are apt to pilfer every thing they can come at, even salt meat; they are bold, and come into the tents to eat victuals out of the dishes. They watch persons baiting the traps for martins, and devour the bait as soon as they turn their backs. These birds lay up stores for the winter, and are seldom seen in January, unless near habitations; they are a kind of mock-bird; when caught, they pine away and die, though their appetite never fails them.\n\nCorvus, 11.

It is a bird of passage; visits the neigh-\nneighbourhood of Albany Fort in April, leaves it in September; lays from four to six eggs in hollow trees, feeds on small worms and other insects.

The descriptions of Linneus and Brisson agree; only the two middlemost feathers are black, the next are of the same colour, but have a white rhomboidal spot near the tip; the next are black, with the upper half obliquely white, the very tip being black; the next after that are white, with a round black spot on the inner side close to the base, and the lower part of the shaft is black, the outermost feathers are quite white, the shaft only at the base being black.\n\n14.

Woodpartridge.\n\nThese birds are all the year long at Hudson’s Bay, and never change the colour of their plumage. The accounts from Hudson’s Bay say, there is no material difference between the male and female; which must be a mistake, as they are really very different. Linneus’s descriptions of the Tetrao Canadensis, and Canace, both answer to the specimens sent over, so that, after comparing them, I find they are only one and the same species. I suppose the dividing them into two, was occasioned by Briffon’s and Edwards’s descriptions, being taken from specimens sent from different parts of the continent of America, and perhaps caught at different seasons. Mr. de Buffon has, I find, the same opinion with me, and by comparing the drawings of Edwards, with those of the Planches enluminées, it is put beyond a doubt. These birds are very stupid, may be knocked down with a stick, and are frequently caught by the natives.\ntives with a stick and a loop. In summer they are good eating; but in winter they taste strongly of the pine spruce, upon which they feed during that season, eating berries in summer. They live in pine woods, their nests are on the ground; they generally lay but five eggs.\n\n*Tetrao, 16. Lagopus, 274. 4. White Grouse. Faun. Am. Sept. 10. Ptarmigan. Br. Zool.

Willow-partridges.\n\nThe Hudson’s Bay ptarmigan has been separated from the European in the British Zoology, and afterwards by M. de Buffon: however, I must own, I cannot yet find the differences which they assign to these species. They contend that the Hudson’s Bay bird figured by Edwards is twice as big as the European ptarmigan; Mr. Edwards, I think, does not intimate this, when he says, the bird is of a middle size, between partridge and pheasant; he on the contrary supposes them to be the same species. The British Zoology, after Willoughby, says, the ptarmigan’s length is $13\\frac{3}{4}$ inches. The account from Severn River says it is $16\\frac{1}{4}$ inches. The breadth in the British Zoology is said to be 23 inches. The breadth in the Hudson’s Bay birds, according to the accounts from Severn River, is 23 inches. Willoughby’s ptarmigan weighed 14 ounces; that in the British Zool.\nZool. illustr. t. 13. 19 ounces; that from the Hudson's Bay (1½ lb) 24 ounces. These differences are of little consequence, and far from increasing the Hudson's Bay bird to double the size of the European. The British Zoology says, there is a difference in the summer colours; but Mr. Edwards informs us, that he compared the Hudson's Bay bird with the descriptions of former ornithologists, and found them to answer; he likewise assures us he had the same bird from Norway. Therefore I cannot help dissenting from the British Zoology, in this one particular, and thinking with Linneus and Brisson, that the European and Hudson's Bay ptarmigans are the same, especially as the colours vary very much in the different sexes and at different seasons. To this we may add the testimony of a gentleman well versed in natural history, who, having had opportunities of comparing numbers of Hudson's Bay and European ptarmigans, assured me that he did not see any difference between them. They go together in great flocks in the beginning of October, living among the willows, of which they eat the tops (whence they have got the name of willow partridges): about that time they lose their beautiful summer plumage, and exchange it for a snowy white dress, most providently adapted by its thickness to screen them against the severity of the season, and by its colour against their enemies.\nthe hawks and owls, against whose attacks they would otherwise find no shelter. Each feather is double, that is, a short one under a long one, to keep them warm. In the latter end of March, they begin again to change their plumage, and have got their full summer dress by the end of June. They breed everywhere along the coast, and have from nine to eleven young at a time; making their nests on the ground, generally on dry ridges. They are excellent eating, and so plentiful that ten thousand have been taken at Severn, York, and Churchill Forts. The method of netting or catching them, is as follows: a net made of jack-twine, twenty feet square, is laced to four long poles, and supported in front with the sticks, in a perpendicular situation; a long line is fastened to these supports, one end of it reaching to a place where a person lies concealed; several men drive the ptarmigans (which are as tame as chickens, especially on a mild, snowy day), towards the net, which they run to, as soon as they see it. The person concealed draws the line, by which means the net falls down, and catches 50 or 70 ptarmigans at once. They are sometimes rather wild, but grow better humoured (as Mr. Graham says) by being driven about, for they seldom forsake those willows which they have once frequented.\n\nTetrao.\nTetrao. 17.

Albany Fort 1 and 2.\n\nThis bird answers the descriptions given of it by the ornithologists in all respects, and perfectly resembles the figure in Brisson, and in the Planches enluminées. It differs from Edwards's ruffed heathcock, t. 248. or Linneus's Tetrao umbellus, as the latter has not the shining black axillar feathers, or shoulder-knot, but a ferruginous one, is much less, and has brighter colours. M. de Buffon, however, thinks they are the same, and suspects at the same time, that the bird which he calls la grosse Gelinotte du Canada (and which is the same with the Society's specimens) is the female of Mr. Edwards's bird, t. 248. This conjecture is destroyed by the specimens now sent from Hudson's Bay, which by the accounts from thence are expressly said to be males. The shoulder-knot grouses bear the Indian name of Pufkee, or Puspufkee, at Hudson's Bay, on account of the leanness and dryness of their flesh, which is extremely white, and of a very close texture, but when well prepared is excellent eating. They are pretty common at Moose Fort and Henly House, but are seldom seen at Albany Fort, or to the northward of the above places. In winter they feed upon juniper.\nniper tops, in summer on gooseberries, raspberries, currants, cranberries, &c. They are not migratory, staying all the year at Moose Fort; they build their nests on dry ground, hatch nine young at a time, to which the mother clucks, as our common hen does; and on the least appearance of danger, or in order to enjoy a comfortable degree of warmth, the young ones retire under the wings of their parent.\n\nN. B. A specimen, which is supposed to be either a young bird or a female, wants the blueish black shoulder-knot; but it is the same in all other respects.\n\nTetrao, 18. Phasianellus. Linn. Syst. Nat. Ed. X. p. 160. n. 5. Edw. 117. Longtailed Grouse. Faun. Am. Septentr. 10.\n\nSevern River, No 6 and 7. Albany Fort, No 3.\n\nThis bird, which Mr. Edwards has drawn plate 117, was by Linneus in the tenth edition of his System, ranged as a new species of grouse or tetrao, by the specific name of Phasianellus (alluding to the name of Pheasant which it bears at Hudson's Bay, and likewise to its pointed tail). He afterwards in the new or twelfth edition of the System, p. 273, makes it a variety of the great Cock of the Wood, or Tetrao Urogallus, probably from the account in Mr. Edwards, that the male struts very upright, is in general of a darker colour than the female, and has a glossy neck. These circumstances, however, are not sufficient to bring\nbring them under the same species, for it is known that the males of all the grouse tribe, and indeed of most of the gallinaceous birds, are used to strut in a very stately manner, and that the colours of their plumage are much more distinct than those of the females. But the specific difference alone, which Linneus assigns to the cock of the wood, absolutely excludes our Hudson's Bay species; he calls it Tetrao pedibus hirsutis, cauda rotundata, axillis albis. Whoever examines Mr. Edwards's figure, and the specimens now in the Society's possession, will find the tail very short, but pointed, the two middle feathers being half an inch longer than the rest, (Mr. Edwards says two inches) and the axillæ, or shoulders, by no means white: besides this difference, the colour and size of the Hudson's Bay bird are likewise vastly different from those of the cock of the wood. Its length is 17 inches, its breadth 24, and, as Mr. Edwards justly says, it is somewhat bigger than the common pheasant. The great cock of the wood is as big as a turkey; and its female, which is much less, however far exceeds our bird, it being 26 inches long, and 40 broad. See British Zool. octavo, p. 200. The figures given of the female of the T. Urogallus, or great cock of the wood, in the Br. Zool. folio, plate M*, and the Planche enlumineé 75, will serve upon comparison as a convincing proof of the vast difference there is between the Hudson's Bay pheasant grouse and the Europeancock\nof the wood. The figure, which Mr. Edwards has given of the former bird, does not exactly correspond with the Society's specimen, as he has represented the marks on the breast half-moon shaped, though they are heart-shaped as those on the belly in the dried bird; that is, they are white spots, with a pale brownish yellow cordated brim. Nor can I agree with Mr. Edwards, when he calls this bird the long-tailed grouse from Hudson's Bay; for its tail is really very short, in comparison with that of other grouse, and its smallness and acuteness afford one of the most distinguishing characters of the species.\n\nThe native Indians call these pheasant grouse, Oc-kif-cow: they are found all the year long, amongst the small juniper bushes, of which the buds are their principal food, as also the buds of birch in winter, and all sorts of berries in summer. They never vary their colours; nor is there any great difference between the male and female, except in the caruncula or comb over the eye, which in the male is an inch long, and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of an inch high. The account from Albany Fort adds, that the colour of the male is somewhat browner, and almost a chocolate on the breast. Their flesh is of a light brown, exceeding juicy, and they are very plump. They lay from 9 to 13 eggs; their young can run almost as soon as they are hatched; they make a piping noise somewhat like a chicken. The cock has a shrill crowing note, not very loud; but\nbut when disturbed, or whilst flying, he makes a repeated noise of cuck, cock. They are most common in winter at Albany Fort.\n\nBefore I leave the genus of grouses, I must observe that their feet have a peculiarity, taken notice of by few authors; the toes, in several species, have on each side a row of short flexible teeth, like those of a comb; so that the toes appear pectinated. The species, which are known to have such pectinated toes, are,\n\n1. The great Cock of the Wood, *Tetrao Urogallus*, Linn.\n2. The Black Cock, *T. Tetrix*, Linn.\n3. The Spotted Grous, \\{ *T. Canadenfs*, \\\\\n   *T. Canace*, Linn.\\}\n4. The Ruffed Grous, *T. Umbellus*, Linn.\n5. The Shoulder-knot Grous, *T. Togatus*, Linn.\n6. The Pheasant Grous, *T. Phasianellus*.\n7. The Hazel Hen, *T. Bonasia*, Linn.\n8. The Pyrenæan Grous, *T. Alchata*, Linn.\n\nThis is a circumstance, which ought to be attended to in all other species of grouses, as it may in time afford a distinguishing character for a division in this great genus; the ptarmigan, or *T. Lagopus*, Linn. is without these teeth.\nIV. {Columbae.\n{Columbine. Faun. Am. Sept.\n\n7. Columba,} 19. Migratoria. 285. 36. Migratory Pigeon. } Pigeon. Catefb. I. 23. Kalm II. p. 82. t.

Their common food are berries and juniper buds in winter; they fly about in great flocks, and are reckoned good eating. This account is confirmed by Kalm in his travels (English edition) Vol. II. p. 82 and 311. They hatch only two eggs at a time, and their nests are built in trees. Their eyes are small and black, the irides yellow, the feet red; the neck finely glossed with purple, brighter in the male. They weigh 9 ounces.\n\nV. {Passeres.\n{Passerine. Faun. Am. Sept.\n\n8.

Albany Fort, N° 6.\n\nThis species is indifferently described by Linneus, who says that all the tail-feathers on their inner web are white, (restrictibus dimidio interiori albis); though it does not appear that he saw a specimen of it himself. Both the quill\nquill and tail-feathers are dusky, and in both\nthe outermost feather only has a white exte-\nrior margin. The coverts of the tail are of\na pale ferruginous colour, and two of them\nare nearly as long as the tail itself. The sca-\npulars are ferruginous; in the male, the head\nand whole back have a tinge of the same co-\nlour, marked with dusky streaks; in the fe-\nmale, the back is grey, and the dusky stripes\nof a darker hue. The crown of the head is\nblack in the male, dusky in the female; the\nforehead is yellow, the bill and feet are black,\nthe belly of a dirty reddish white. These\nlarks are migratory, they visit the environs\nof Albany Fort in the beginning of May,\nbut go further northward to breed: they feed\non grass-seeds, and buds of the sprig-birch;\nrun into small holes, and keep close to the\nground, from whence the natives give them\nthe name of Chi-chup-pi-sue.\n\n9.

Albany Fort, 7, 8, 9.\nThe descriptions of these birds in various authors\ncoincide with the specimens; at Severn River\nthey appear at the beginning of May, and\nleave the environs before the frost sets in.\nAt Moose Fort, in the north latitude 51°,\nthey build their nest, lay their eggs, and hatch\ntheir young in the space of fourteen days;\nbut at York fort and Severn settlement this is\ndone\ndone in 26 days: they build their nests in trees, lay four beautiful light-blue eggs, feed on worms and carrion: when at liberty they sing very prettily, but confined in a cage, they lose their melody. There is no material distinction between the male and female. Their weight is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ ounces, the length 9 inches, and the breadth 1 foot; they are called red birds at Hudson's Bay; their Indian name is Pee-pee-chue.\n\nTurdus, 22.\n\nSevern River, No 54 and 55, male and female.\n\nFrom the striking similarity with our blackbird, the English at Hudson's Bay have given this bird the same name. However, upon a close examination, I find the difference very great between our European blackbird, and the Hudson's Bay or American one. The plumage of the male, instead of being deep black without any gloss, as in ours, has a shining purple cast, not unlike the plumage of the Gracula Quiscula, Linn. or shining Gracule, Faun. Am. Sept.; or the Maize thief, of Kalm. The female indeed is very like our female blackbird, being of a dusky colour on the back, and a dark grey on the breast. The feet and bill are quite black in both sexes; the former have the back claw almost as long again as any of the other claws. There are no vestiges of yellow palpebrae in either the male or the female; the bill in both is strong, smooth, and subulated; the upper\nupper mandible being carinated, but very little arched, and without any tooth or indenture whatever, on the lower side. The nostrils are as in other thrushes. This bird has no bristles at the base of its bill, its feet have such segments as Scopoli in the Annus I. Historico-Naturalis attributes to the stares. Instead of being solitary and living retired like the European blackbirds, these American ones come in flocks to Severn River in June, live among the willows, build in all kinds of trees, and return to the southward in autumn. They feed on worms and maggots; their weight is $2\\frac{1}{4}$ ounces, and they are nine inches long, and one foot broad. One that was kept twelve months in a cage pined away, and died. Notwithstanding these circumstances, I cannot help remaining undetermined with regard to this bird, which at first sight is like the blackbird, has the bill of a thrush, and the feet and gregarious nature of a stare. It is to be hoped, that future accounts from Hudson's Bay may inform us further, of the nature of this bird, its time of incubation, the number of eggs it lays, and the colour of those eggs, together with the note of the bird, the difference and characteristick marks of both the male and female, and other circumstances, which may serve to determine to what genus and species we are to refer this bird.\n\nVL.

The description of the snowflake, or the same bird in winter dress, ibid. vol.

They are the first of the migratory birds, which come in spring to Severn settlement; in the year 1771 they appeared April the 11th, stayed about a month or five weeks, and then proceeded further northward in order to breed there; they return in September, stay till the cold grows severe in November, then retire southward to a warmer climate. They live in flocks, feed on grass-seeds, and about the dunghills, are easily caught under a small net, some oatmeal being strewed under it to allure them; they are very fat, and fine eating.

It is very difficult to procure, and therefore it could not be determined whether the specimen was a male or female. It frequents the plains, and lives on grass-seeds; it weighs \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) an ounce, is 6\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches long, and 9 inches broad: it has a small blue eye, and a whitish bill faintly tinged with red; the whole body is blackish, or of a foot colour, the belly alone with the two outermost tail feathers on each side being white.

These birds stay at Albany Fort all the year, yet seem most numerous in the coldest weather; probably being then more in want of food, they come nearer the settlements, in order to pick up all remnants.

The specimen sent answers in some particulars to the description of the Martin, Hirundo Urbica, Linn. but seems to be smaller, and has no white on the rump.

Mr. Edwards's measurements and drawings correspond very well with the specimen.\n\nThis bird appears at Severn river the latter end of May, lives chiefly among the swamps and willows, where it builds its nest, and lays only two eggs at a time; it is very indolent, and, when roused, removes only to a short distance.\n\n18.

It agrees in other respects perfectly well with the descriptions: it comes to Albany fort in April or beginning of May, and leaves it the latter end of September.

They visit Severn river first in the middle of May, on their journey northward, where they breed; return in the beginning of September, with their young, staying at Severn settlement about a fortnight each time. The Indian name is *Way-way*, at Churchill river. Linneus has not taken notice of this species.\n\n**Anas.** 46. Canadensis. 198. 14. Canada Goose. Faun. Am. Sept. 16. Edw. 151. Catesby I. 92, &c.\n\nSevern River, No 42.\n\nThe Canada geese are very plentiful at Hudson's Bay, great quantities of them are salted, but they have a fishy taste. The specimen sent over agrees perfectly with the descriptions and drawings. At Hudson's Bay this species is called the *Small Grey Goose*. Besides this, and the preceding white goose, Mr. Graham, the gentleman who sent the account from Severn settlement, mentions three other species of wild geese to be met with at Hudson's Bay; he calls them,\n\n1. The large Grey Goose.\n2. The Blue Goose.\n3. The Laughing Goose.\nThe first of these, the large grey goose, he says, is so common in England, that he thought it unnecessary to send specimens of it over. It is however presumed, that though Mr. Graham has shewn himself a careful observer, and an indefatigable collector; yet, not being a naturalist, he could not enter into any minute examination about the species to which each goose belongs, nor from mere recollection know, that his grey goose was actually to be met with in England. A natural historian, by examination, often finds material differences, which would escape a person unacquainted with natural history. The wish, therefore, of seeing the specimens of these species of geese, must occur to every lover of that science. Mr. Graham says, the large grey geese are the only species that breed about Severn river. They frequent the plains and swamps along the coast. Their weight is nine pounds.\n\nThe blue goose is as big as the white goose; and the laughing goose is of the size of the Canada or small grey goose. These two last species are very common along Hudson's Bay to the southward, but very rare to the northward of Severn river. The Indians have a peculiar method of killing all these species of geese, and likewise swans. As these birds fly regularly along the marshes, the Indians range themselves in a line across the marsh, from the wood to high water mark, about musket shot from each other,\nso as to be sure of intercepting any geese which fly that way. Each person conceals himself, by putting round him some brushwood; they likewise make artificial geese of sticks and mud, placing them at a short distance from themselves, in order to decoy the real geese within shot: thus prepared, they sit down, and keep a good look out; and as soon as the flock approaches, they all lie down, imitating the call or note of geese, which these birds no sooner hear, and perceive the decoys, than they go straight down towards them; then the Indians rise on their knees, and discharge one, two or three guns each, killing two or even three geese at each shot, for they are very expert. Mr. Graham says, he has seen a row of Indians, by calling round a flock of geese, keep them hovering among them, till every one of the geese was killed. Every species of goose has its peculiar note or call, which must greatly increase the difficulty of enticing them.\n\nAnas. 47. Albeola. 199. 18. The Red Duck. Faun. Am. Sept. 17. Edw. t. 100.

Upon the whole it is\nalmost without a doubt that the bird repre-\nsented by Edwards, plate 280, and Br.

Linneus says, that the\ntemples are black; in the specimen now sent\nover, and in Mr. Edwards's figure, which\nLinneus quotes, they are white; the breast,\nback, and wings, are not black as he says,\nbut rather brown and dusky. A further\nproof, that Linneus's Anas Glacialis and Hye-\nmalis are the same, is that the feet in both\nt. 156 and 280 of Edwards are red, and the\nbill black, with an orange spot.\n\nAnas.\nAnas. 51.
