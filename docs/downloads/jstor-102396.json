Part of a Letter of Mr. Robert Tredwey, to Dr. Leonard Plukenet, Dated Jamaica, Feb. 12. 1696, giving an Account of a great piece of Ambergriese thrown on that Island; with the Opinion of some there about the way of its Production.\n\nI shall only at present let you know the Account I received from Ambergriese Ben, for so the Man is called from the vast Quantity of that valuable Commo-\ndity he found Two Years ago; viz. One Hundred and Fifty Pound Weight dashed on the Shoar at a Place in these Parts called Ambergrise Point, where the Spaniards usually come once a Year to look for it. This vast Quantity was divided in Two Parts; supposed by rolling and tumbling in the Sea; but that which I have to inform you, is the Way how 'tis produced; viz. from a Creature, as Honey or Silk; for I saw in sundry Places of this Body, the Beaks, Wings, and part of the Body of the Creature which I preserved some time by me, and this ignorant Fellow (for so you would term him if you knew all) has seen the Creature alive; and he adds, That he believes they swarm as Bees, on the Sea-Shore or in the Sea. This account is very different from what I ever met with, so I thought fit to Communicate it. We have lately discover'd Two hot Springs. One to Windward, which seems Sulphurous: The other to Leeward is very Salt; but as I am told does not partake of Brimstone, and both very much magnify'd for the Endemick Diseases of these Parts, the dry Belly-ach, Pains of the Nerves, and Yaws.\n\nERRATA.
