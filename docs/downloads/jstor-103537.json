  "text": "the spermatick Vessels; \\( e, e \\), a Branch of the spermatick Vessels along the Side of the Intestin, compressed by the transversal Fibres, and inflected through its whole Extent in an uniform Manner; \\( f, f, f \\), the Windings and Turnings of the spermatick Vessels; \\( g, g \\), the transversal Fibres; \\( h \\), the cartilaginous Membrane surrounding the Anus; \\( i \\), the small Slit in its Middle; \\( k \\), the very fine capillary Process; \\( m, m \\), the small Bladders covering the Skin.\n\nFig. 7. A Male Worm inverted, and dissected about the Anus, in Order to see with Ease the Duct lying under the alimentary Canal; \\( a \\), the wrinkled alimentary Canal; \\( b \\), the whitish Duct under the wrinkled Canal; \\( c \\), the spermatick Vessels.\n\nFig. 8. \\( a \\), the vermicular Process of the spermatick Vessels; \\( b, b \\), the Branches of the spermatick Vessels, freed from their Windings; \\( c, c \\), the same Branches dissected.\n\nV. Some material Observations upon dissecting an Ostrich, made lately by Mr. Ranby, Surgeon to his Majesty's Household, and F. R. S.\n\nAbout five Years ago, I laid before the Society some Observations made in an Ostrich dissected, by Order of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. to which Account I beg Leave to add two or three more Observations which escaped my Notice in my former Dissection. And First, the Eye, the Figure of which, when taken\ntaken out of the Orbit, I think particular, being almost triangular, with some little Variation in the Bony Scales, from that in Phil. Trans. No. 386. The Contents of the Stomach were of such a Kind, that they were hardly capable (without very great Alteration) of passing the lower Orifice, which is very small.\n\nThe Diameter of the Duodenum much smaller than any of the Intestines, and free from Valves, as are the Jejunum and Ileum, except the latter, which has a few Valves, as it approaches near the Colon. The Colon was uneven, with very regular Cells: These Cells were formed by Valves, which were on the Inside, and transversely situated, each making more than half a Circle.\n\nThe Parts in other Respects answer the Description given by the several curious Gentlemen that have dissected this Animal.",
