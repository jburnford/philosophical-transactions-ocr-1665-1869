into which, he said, they crawled down as worms do into the ground. The same puppy was again applied, and it was then (at the second taking off of the puppy) that I made the visit, and saw only one worm got out into the puppy, but a very live and stirring one. Many were afterwards kill'd by injections. These worms I affirm, according to my best knowledge, (and I had the opportunity of comparing them) were of the very Species of the Lumbrici teretes, which Children familiarly void from the Guts. They were betwixt three and four inches long; all, about the matter, of an equal bigness, as of one brood; something thicker than a Ducks quill; very sharp at both ends; stiff, and exactly round; without incisures, visible at least, and yet could move and twist themselves readily enough. All the difference was in the colour, these being much whiter than any I have seen from the Guts. Vid. Barthol. in Hist. 60 Cent. 5, where near twenty worms, as long as my finger, were found in a Lady's arm, probably of this Species too.

I beg your pardon for my, &c.

The Undertakings of Mr. Henry Bond Senior, a famous Teacher of the art of Navigation in London, concerning the Variation of the Variation of the Magnetical compass and the Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle; as the Result and Conclusion of 38 years Magnetical Study.

THE said Mr. Bond can shew the Cause of the Variation of the Variation of the Magnetical Needle or Compass by the Motion of two Magnetical Poles; how these Poles are found; and what their Distance is from the Poles of the Earth; what their Annual Motion is, and from whence it proceeds.

By Calculation he finds all the Variations that have been observed at or near London for above 90 years past, and so by consequence it may be found at London to the end of the World.

He hath calculated a Table to every five minutes of the Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle; so that by the Needles Incli-
Inclination, and that Table, and the Latitude of the place, he can find the Longitude of any place in world.

By that Table also he finds Mr. Rob. Normans Inclination, which he found A. 1576; and can shew what will be the greatest and least Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle in any Latitude in the world.

He hath four Examples of finding the Longitude by the help of the Inclinatory Needle; one at Balora in East-India in the year 1657. Another at Cape Charles, on the coast of Virginia before that time. The third, at the Cape of Good Hope. The fourth, at the Straights of Magellan.

So far He: who, 'tis hoped, will shortly by the generosity of some Noble Virtuoso or other, recompensing his studies and pains, be induced to discover to others this his knowledge.

An Extract of a Letter written by Mr. John Templer June 16. 1673. containing some Observations upon a pleasant way of catching Carps.

On Thursday last, Sir Justinian Isham invited me to walk with him to his Fish-ponds, and to see a boy throw out Carps with his hands at any time in the heat of the day. I saw four very large ones, that the boy took. His way was this: He waded into the Pond, and then returning to the sides, he would grope them out in the Sedg or weeds, and, tickling them with his fingers under the belly, quickly remove his fingers to their gills, and throw them out upon the land. And this he did not in a narrow but large pond, of half an Acre of ground, or rather an Acre. In which practice I must note two or three things, that seem observable to me;

1. Carps (and I suppose all other fish that keep near the bottom) keep always in a shoal, although happily there may be more than one company, answerable to the difference of their Sexes; as in Deer at some seasons.

2. When they move from one place to another, they raise the mud in the heat of the day; and you may easily observe, what
