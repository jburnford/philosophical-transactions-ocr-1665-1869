Paris Rain is $16.4\frac{1}{2}$ Lines, and the Barometrical Range $2\frac{1}{2}$ Lines more than the Padua.

The last Thing which the illustrious Marquis takes notice of is the Magnetical Declination, which he faith is $13$ Degrees West, and hath decreased in the six Years $\frac{1}{60}$ths; that every Day there is a small Alteration in the Declination, so that it doth not continue the same a whole Day together; that the Declination of all needles (especially if touched by different Magnets) is different a few Sexagesims. But these Niceties I recommend to the Enquiry of the Curious, because they disagree with the Observations of Gilbert, and most of the Magnetic Writers.
