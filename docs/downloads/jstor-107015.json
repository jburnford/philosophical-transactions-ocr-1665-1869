It was in general a calm frost, with vast quantities of snow coming and going; so that though it was pretty thick at times, it never lay so deep as it sometimes does. But perhaps some of the deep pits of snow and beds of ice were not entirely gone at the end of March.\n\nAfter the frost broke, there came near a fortnight of wet weather, not without some snow and frost; this made the spring seed time begin very late; but when it did come, it was very favourable and quick, cool but not frosty, and the grain came up well. The beginning of the summer was dry and cool; a hot week about May 20; suddenly turned cold, with frosty mornings for some days, and then mild again. The former part of the year, both in spring and summer, was remarkably cloudy, and a great deal of cold weather and frosty mornings in May and June, and perhaps some in July; yet a few hot days at times; a week of such weather with rain at the beginning of June, brought on things very much.\n\nA showery beginning of hay time, though not in great quantities, was some hindrance to the first got hay, but it increased the quantity of the later cut, which was also better\ngot; and the harvest was very fine, and as sunny as the season before had been cloudy: and it continued dry, calm, sunny, and burning much till the end of September; and then at a very suitable time, the harvest being in, and still warmth enough to make the grass grow, a wet and warm October made plenty of it against winter. The season being fine, the leaves continued long upon the trees, and the winter was very open and warm, and no considerable frost at all, but mild and warm, and the ground still green; and December was warmer and freer from frost than November. But it was a remarkably stormy winter, both for frequency and violence, doing much mischief among the shipping; and almost continual south and west winds made the passage down the Channel difficult.",
