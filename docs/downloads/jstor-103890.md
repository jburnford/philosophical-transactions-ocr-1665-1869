Parhelion was once so bright, that, taking the Advantage of a Place where a Chimney shaded the true Sun, it cast a very visible Shadow: The white and luminous horizontal Tail also, that went from this Parhelion, was much longer than that of the other, reaching at one Time beyond the outer of the two concentric Circles. The Parhelia themselves, tho' very luminous, were, however, never defin'd with any Exactness as to their Discs, but look'd as we sometimes see the Sun through a thin whitish Cloud, and they were themselves of a reddish Colour on that Side next the true Sun. About Eight the Phenomenon was sensibly decreas'd, and had entirely disappear'd by 20 Minutes after.

quidem prodiect, nullum tamen vulnus infligeretur. Postero die circa meridiem praeter omnem expectationem supremum spiritum duxit homo satis robustus. Aperto abdomine cadaveris ingens ruptura in intestino ileo deprehendebatur, ita ut tantummodo a tergo ceteris cohaeret & contenta in cavitatem abdominis effusa ingenitem foetorem naribus afflarent. Hepar pallebat nativo suo colore prorsus destitutum, ipsique etiam pulmones a statu naturali receferant, colore naturali amissio. Ex macula livida abdominis colligebam, saxum angulo acuto impegisse in ventrem & intestinum nimia tensione disruptum suisse, quemadmodum incurvata rumpuntur in convexitate superiori.

XIII. An Account of some new Statical Experiments, by J. T. Desaguliers, LL.D. F.R.S.

WHEN a long and heavy Body lying on the Ground is to be rais'd up at one End, (like a Leaver of the second Kind) while the other End keeps its Place and becomes the Centre of its Motion; the Prop, that is made use of to support it at any Point in its whole Length, sustains a certain Pressure from the Beam. Now the Experiments which I shall make are to shew, by a Force drawing always in the Direction of the Prop, what is the Quantity of the Pressure on the Prop, according to the Length of the Prop, the Angle which it makes with the Beam, or with the Horizon, and the Distance from the Centre of Motion of the Beam at which the Prop is applied. For when the
