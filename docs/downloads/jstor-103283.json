An Extract of another Letter from Mr. James Yonge, upon the same subjects as the former.\n\nHonoured Sir,\n\nThe Anomalous Blackness of the Girl's Face, of which I sent the History, is now divided into a few dark, cloudy Specks; which appear but seldom, and nothing so livid as formerly.\n\nI am told by a Gentleman Hunter, that he lately found in the Paunch of an Hare, two full grown young Ones among the Bowels; but almost rotten: And three Immature Embryo's in the Uterus. The former were certainly Fetus broke out of the Womb, &c.\n\nPlimouth, Nov. 1.\n1709.\n\nMost Worthy Sir,\n\nYours, &c.\n\nJames Yonge.",
