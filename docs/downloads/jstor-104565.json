Lucius Vitellius Maximiniani filius Titus Ancinus, * civis Hispanus Cauriensis & equitum alae Vettonum curator, annos XLVI stipendii XXVI. hic sepultus est.\n\nVII. Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Dr. Stephen Hales F.R.S. to the Rev. Mr. Westly Hall, concerning some Electrical Experiments.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTeddington, Feb. 23, 1746-7.\n\nThe favour of yours of Jan. 27. I should have answer'd sooner, but have been prevented by Variety of Business, especially\n\n* Like nubes, labes, sepes. § Of the City of Coria in Spain.\ncially the being much in London; where I saw last Week some electrical Experiments; in which new Field of Researches there are daily new Discoveries made: The active electric Fluid seems to be a great Agent, in Conjunction with the Air, in the Production of Fire.\n\nA warm thick Piece of Iron being suspended by two silk Lines, had a warm very thick Piece of Brass laid on it, on which was placed a common Hen's Egg: When electrified, the Flashes from the Iron were of a bright silver light Colour; from the Brass (especially near it) the Flashes were green; and from the Egg of a yellowish Flame Colour; which seems to argue, that some Particles of those different Bodies were carried off in the Flashes, whence these different Colours were exhibited.\n\nIt is suspected that great Degrees of electrifying have occasion'd some Women to miscarry; and no Wonder that such sudden Shocks should do it. I wrote to Mr. King the Experimenter to electrify a Frog, while the Circulation of its Blood was viewed with a Microscope, to see if it accelerated its Motion, which he has not yet done.\n\nHe observes, that a Piece of Linen that has never been washed, will soon give a good Degree of Electricity to a large warm glass Tube; viz. on account of the mealy Paste, which Weavers dress the Linen with; and therefore any Piece of Linen thus dressed will do.\n\nI gave an Account in the General Evening Post of September last of the great Benefit of Ventilators in Newgate, and in the Success Frigate for Georgia, which lay five Months wind-bound in our Chanel with the Transports for Cape Breton, the rest of which were all\nall very sickly; but in the Georgia Frigate, in which were about 300 Men, all were in good Health; and last Week I was informed that they got all in Health to Georgia.\n\n* * *\n\nYour obliged and\n\naffectionate humble Servant,\n\nStephen Hales.\n\nVIII. Extract of a Letter from Tho. Aery M. D. to Cromwell Mortimer M. D. Secret. R. S. containing the Particulars of the Cure of a Wound in the Cornea, and a Laceration of the Uvea in the Eye of a Woman.\n\nWhitehaven, June 14. 1748.\n\nS I R,\n\nRead June 30. Your laudable Endeavours to promote the Art of Medicine, make me willing to hope you will pardon the Freedom I take of acquainting you with the following Case, tho' I have not the Happiness of your Acquaintance; and I beg the Favour of you to lay it before the Royal Society, to publish, if you approve of it; which will oblige, Sir,\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\nThomas Aery.",
