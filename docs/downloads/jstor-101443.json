  "text": "so as to shew by the Effects the practicableness of the Invention, mentions thereupon, That he intends very shortly to try something in that kind, of the success whereof he declares to have good hopes.\n\nMonsieur du Son, that excellent Mechanician, doth also at this very present employ himself in London, to bring Telescopes to perfection, by grinding Glasses of a Parabolical Figure, by the means whereof he hopes to enable the Curious to discover more by a Tube of one Foot long, or thereabout, furnished with Glasses thus figured, then can be done by any other Tubes of very many times more that length: The success hereof will (its thought) shortly appear.\n\nAn Advertisement of a way of making more lively Counterfaits of Nature in Wax, then are extant in Painting: And of a new kind of Maps in a low Relievo; both practised in France.\n\nThis was communicated by the Ingenious Mr. John Evelyn, to whom it was sent from Paris in a Letter, as followeth:\n\nHere is in our Neighborhood a French-man, who makes more lively Counterfeits of Nature in Wax, then ever I yet saw in Painting, having an extraordinary address in modelling the Figures, and in mixing the Colours and Shadows; making the Eyes so lively, that they kill all things of this Art I ever beheld: He pretends to make a visit into England with some of his Pieces.\n\nI have also seen a new kind of Maps in low Relievo, or Sculpture: For example, the Isle of Antibe, upon a square of about eight Foot, made of Boards, with a Frame like a Picture: There is represented the Sea, with Ships and other Vessels Artificially made, with their Cannons and Tackle of Wood fixed upon the surface, after a new and most admirable manner. The Rocks about the Island exactly form'd,\nas they are upon the Natural Place; and the Island it self, with all its Inequalities, and Hills and Dales; the Town, the Fort, the little Houses, Platform, and Canons mounted; and even the Gardens and Platforms of Trees, with their green Leaves standing upright, as if they were growing in their Natural Colours: In fine, Men, Beasts, and whatever you may imagine to have any protuberancy above the level of the Sea. This new, delightful, and most instructive form of Map, or Wooden Country, you are to look upon either Horizontally, or sidelong, and it affords equally a very pleasant object.\n\nSome Anatomical Observations of Milk found in Veins, instead of Blood; and of Grass, found in the Wind-pipes of some Animals.\n\nA curious Person wrote not long since from Paris, that there they had, in the House of a Physician, newly open'd a Mans Vein, wherein they found Milk, instead of Blood. This being imparted to Mr. Boyle at Oxford, his Answer was, That the like Observation about white Blood, had been made by a Learned Physician of his acquaintance, and the thing being by him look'd upon as remarkable, he was desirous to have it very circumstantially from the said Physician himself, before he would say more of it. The next Moneth may bring us in this Account.\n\nThe other Particular, mention'd in the Title of this Head, came in a Letter, sent also by Mr. Boyle, in these words:\n\nI shall acquaint you, That two very Ingenious Men, Dr. Clark, and Dr. Lower, were pleas'd to give me an account of a pretty odd kind of Observation: One of them assuring me, That he had several times, in the Lungs of Sheep, found considerable quantity of Grass in the very Branches of the Aspera Arteria: And the other relating to me, That a few Weeks since, He, and a couple of Physicians,",
