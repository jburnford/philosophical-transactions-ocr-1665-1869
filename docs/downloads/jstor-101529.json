  "text": "Percolation of the blood of Animals, whereby that of the one should be changed into the nature of the other.\n\n3. The most probable use of this Experiment may be conjectured to be, that one Animal may live with the blood of another; and consequently, that those Animals, that want blood, or have corrupt blood, may be supplied from others with a sufficient quantity, and of such as is good, provided the Transfusion be often repeated, by reason of the quick expense that is made of the blood.\n\nNote.\n\nIn the last Transactions was also promised an Account by the next, of Monsieur Hevelius his accurate Calcul. of the late Solar Eclipse & Duration, Quantity, &c. But this being to be accompanied with a Scheme, the Graving whereof met with a disappointment, it must be still referred to another Opportunity.\n\nAn account of some Sanative Waters in Herefordshire.\n\nThis account was communicated by Dr. B. in these words.\n\nThere are two Springs in Herefordshire, whereof one is within a Bolt, or at least Bow-shoot of the top of the near adjoining lofty Hill of Malvern, and at great distance from the Foot of the Hill; and hath had a long and old fame for healing of eyes. When I was for some years molested with Tetters on the back of one and sometimes of both my hands, notwithstanding all endeavours of my very friendly and skilful Physicians, I had speedy healing from a neighbouring Spring of far less fame. Yet this Spring healed very old and Ulcerous sores on the Legs of a poor Fellow, which had been poisoned by Irons in the Gaol, after other Chirurgery had been hopeless. And by many tryals upon my hands, and the Tetters, I was perswaded, that in long droughts, and lasting dry Frosts, thole waters were more effectually and more speedily healing, than at other times. And not to omit this circumstance, I did hold this water in my mouth till it was warm, and perchance somewhat intermingled with fasting Spittle, and\nand so dropping it upon the Teter, I there could see it immediately gather a very thin skin upon the raw flesh, not unlike that which is seen to gather upon Milk over a gentle fire. This skin would have small holes in it, through which a moisture did issue in small drops, which being wip'd away, and the water continued to be dropp'd warm out of the mouth, the holes would diminish, and at last be all quite healed up.\n\nFor the Eye-waters, I conceived them more strongly tensive, and clearing the Eyes; and they had a rough smartness, as if they carryed Sand or Gravel into the Eye.\n\nI have known and try'd three or four healing Fountains of late discovery, or of no old fame that I could hear of.\n\nI did once put rich pearl for some days in a vessel of water, to try whether the water would acquire a healing vertue; but my Experiments were interrupted. I had in my thoughts many other ways of Tryal; which I may resume hereafter.\n\nA farther Accompt of the Vitriolate-water, mention'd Num. 18 p. 323. Together with some other Particulars touching Waters.\n\nThis comes from the same hand as follows;\n\nI formerly mention'd to you, that, if that Pool of Mr. Philip's, which seems to be of Vitriolate-water, were on my ground, I would drain it, and search the head of the Spring, pursuing the source, till I could well discern, through what lay of Earth or Gravel it does pass. Now I shall tell you, that I have taken order for the further tryal of the said Water, by boiling a greater quantity in a Furnace, &c. But just as we were in readiness for the tryal, a stream of Rain-water fell into the Pool, and so discourag'd us for the present. I have also taken a course to turn the falling Waters aside, and to drain the Pool, that we may see, what the Native Springs (whether one or more) may be. Of which more hereafter.\n\nI wish (so he goes on) we had a full Accompt of our Salt-springs at Droft-wych near Worcester, and at Nant-wych in Chester (what other Salt-Springs we have in England, I know not;)",
