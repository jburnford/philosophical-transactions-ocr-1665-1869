  "text": "come in a Fortnight to the Bigness of Fig. 5. and are very lively and active, and if they have any Fear, or if they be touched, they suddenly roll themselves up, and make as it were a Ball. A little after they come to creep after the manner of the Silk-Worms that have no Legs, with a brisk and very swift Motion. When they are come to their usual Bigness they hide themselves the most they can, and bringing out of their Mouths the Silk, they make round themselves a small Bag, white within as Paper, but without always dusty and foul'd with Dust. The Bags are to the Natural Eye of the Bigness of Fig. 6. without magnifying. In other Two Weeks in the Summer-time, the Flea is perfectly form'd, without that the Worm quits its Exuviae in its Bag, as do the Silk worms, and as do all Caterpillars; which leave in the same their Exuviae. The Flea, so long as it is inclosed in the Bag, is Milk white, although it has its Legs, but Two Days before it comes out, it becomes coloured, grows hard, and gets Strength, so that coming speedily out, it straight leaps away.\n\nHereunto annexed are the Figures of the Eggs, Fig. 1. the Worm Fig. 2. the Bag Fig. 3. and the Flea Fig. 4. but all of them magnified by the Microscope.\n\nII. A Way to make Two clear Spirituous Inflammable Liquors, which differ very little in Taste and Smell, and being mixed together, do give a fine Carnation Colour, without either sensible Fermentation or Alteration. Communicated by Monsieur Geoffroy, F. R. S.\n\nTo make the first of these Liquors, put a small Handful of dried red Roses into a Glass Bottle, pour on them rectified Spirit of Wine till it cover them an Inch. Let them infuse in the Cold all together in the Bottle for Four or Five Hours, then pour off the Spirit of Wine, which will be clear and have no Colour.\n\nThe Second Liquor is made by putting into some good Spirit of Wine some Drops of good Spirit of Vitriol, or Oyl of Sulphur, so that scarce can the Acid or Sour be discovered by the Tongue.\nIf you put a little of this last Liquor into the first, it will give a fine redish Colour, without making it troubled or causing any other sensible Alteration.\n\nIf instead of this Wine mixed with Acids, you put to the first some Drops of any volatile Alcali's, as of Spirit of Sal Armoniack, or other, it will give a Green Colour to the Infusion.\n\nThe Two first mentioned Liquors were brought to a Meeting of the Royal Society by Monsieur Geoffrey, one of their Members, where the first Experiment above-recited being made, it succeeded according to Expectation.\n\nIII. A further Account of the China Cabinet, by Hans Sloane, M.D.\n\nSEEDS to clarify Water, (vid. Fig. 8.) These Seeds I have seen come several times heretofore from the Coast of Coromandel and Malabar, where they are used for the clarifying Water. They are about the Bignets of a small Pea, only broader and flatter, having Striae run from their Center after the manner of the common Nux Vomica. The best Account I have had of the way of using them was from Dr. Brown, who lived in the East-Indies some time, he says they rub or grate them on the bottom of a small Earthen Basin, wherein is contained some Water. This Water and Powder is put into a large Quantity of muddy, or foul Water, which is by this clarified.\n\nNux pepita seu faba sancti Ignatii. This is figured No. 7, being about the bigness of a Nutmeg, and Triangular. This Fruit is very much esteemed in the Philippine Islands for the Cure of many Distempers, as will be more at large seen in the next Transaction, wherein is design'd to be published from Mr. Buckley, a further Account of it, and the Description and Figure of its Leaves, Flower, &c. drawn and sent from the Philippine Islands, where it grows, by Father Kamelli, to Mr. Ray and Mr. Pettiver, Fellows of the Royal Society.\n\nIV.
