  "text": "wards we opened it, and a great blast of Wind rushing out, it sunk down again immediately; neither was there any more than six ounces of a whitish Liquor in it. The Lungs were so distended with Wind as to fill up the whole Cavity of the Thorax; we pricked, and cut into them, but not a drop of Water came from them. The Man had the Character of a poor honest harmless Fellow, and therefore could not well be suspected of being murder'd, and the posture of his standing made every one conclude that it was the darkness of the Night that occasioned his losing his Way and Life at the same time. And as we have all the reason in the World to believe that this person was stifled alive under Water, so we may see how fallacious that standing Rule of the Antients is, who allowed no person to be drowned, without considerable quantities of Water, both in the Lungs, Stomach and Intestines.\n\nAfter the Author hath given us these Experiments, he proceeds to answer the Objection that was made, of persons recovering by being set upon their Heads; and afterwards to show why it happens, that in drowned persons the Water is seldom found either in the Lungs or Stomach. For which we refer you to the Book itself, containing besides twelve uncommon Observations of different Cases.\n\nPrinted by Sam. Smith and Benj. Walford, Printers to the Royal Society, at the Princes Arms in St Paul's Churchyard, 1706.\n\nERRATA,\nIn Philosoph. Transact.
