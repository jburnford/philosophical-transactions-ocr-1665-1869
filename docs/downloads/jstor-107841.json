In a letter addressed to Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, Bart. K.C.B. late Governor of New South Wales. Presented to the Royal Society by John Frederick William Herschel, Esq. Vice President.\n\nRead December 20, 1827.\n\nThe following nebulæ and clusters of stars in the southern hemisphere were observed by me at my house in Paramatta, situated about $6''$ of a degree south and about $1^{\\circ}.78$ of time east of the Brisbane Observatory. The observations were made in the open air, with an excellent 9-feet reflecting telescope, the clear aperture of the large mirror being nine inches. This telescope was occasionally fitted up as a meridian telescope, with a strong iron axis firmly attached to the lower side of the tube nearly opposite the cell of the large mirror, and the ends of the axis rested in brass Y's, which were screwed to blocks of wood let into the ground about 18 inches, and projecting about 4 inches above the ground; one end of the axis carried a brass semicircle divided into half degrees and read off by a vernier to minutes. The position and index error of the instrument were ascertained by the passage of known stars. The eye end of the telescope was raised or lowered by a cord over a pulley attached to a strong wooden post let into the ground about two feet: with this apparatus I have observed a sweep of eight or ten degrees in breadth with very little deviation of the instrument from the plane of the meridian, and the tremor was very little even with a considerable magnifying power. I made drawings or representations of a great number of the nebulæ and clusters at the time of observation, several of which are annexed to this paper; and also very correct drawings of the Nebulæ major and minor, together with a representation of the milky nebulosity surrounding the star $\\eta$ Robur Caroli. The places of the\n\nMDCCCXXVIII.\nsmall stars in the Nebulæ major and minor, and also those accompanying the η Robur Caroli, I ascertained by the mural circle in the year 1825, at which time I was preparing to commence a general survey of the southern hemisphere. These stars being laid down upon the chart, enabled me to delineate the nebulosity very accurately.\n\nThe nebulae are arranged in the order of their south polar distances to the nearest minute for 1827, and in zones for each degree in the order of their right ascension. The column on the right hand shows the number of times the object has been observed.\n\nThe reductions and arrangement have been principally made since my return to Europe; and I trust this catalogue of the nebulae will be found an acceptable addition to that knowledge which the Brisbane observatory has been the means of putting the world in possession of, respecting that important and hitherto but little known portion of the heavens.\n\n| No. | RA | S.P.D. | Description of the Nebulæ and Stars. | No.of Obs. |\n|-----|-----|--------|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| 1   | 4° 13' 0\" | 12° 14' | A very small faint round nebula, about 12'' diameter, with a very minute star south following dist. 1' ........................................... | 1 |\n| 2   | 0° 33' 6\" | 15° 41' | A faint nebula, about 1½' long, irregular figure, rather branched.

The ray is about 7' in length, and nearly 2' in breadth at the broadest part, near the southern extremity. With the sweeping power this appears like a star with a very faint milky ray south following, the ray gradually spreading in breadth from the star, and rounded off at the broader end. But with a higher power it is not a star with a ray, but a very faint nebula, and the star is not involved or connected with it: I should call it a very faint nebula of a long oval shape, the smaller end towards the star; this is easily resolvable into extremely minute points or stars, but I cannot discover the slightest indications of attraction or condensation towards any part of it. I certainly had not the least suspicion of this object being resolvable when I discovered it with the sweeping power, nor even when I examined it a second time; it is a beautiful object, of a uniform faint light.

There are many similar small stars scattered in the field with a power of 170; the nebulosity is extremely faint. This precedes the 49 Centauri, Bode, which is a star of the 4th or 5th magnitude, and not of the 6th as given in Bode's catalogue. |\n| 291 | 11 56 9 | 29 45 | A cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes, irregular figure, about 6' long and 4' broad. |\n| 292 | 12 15 0 | 29 2 | A pretty cluster of extremely small stars, resembling a pretty large faint nebula, about 6' or 7' diameter; the compression is very gradual to the centre; a pretty bright star is in the following side of the cluster, round figure. |\n| 293 | 15 49 5 | 29 3 | A very faint small nebula, about 10'' diameter, with a small star near the south margin, but not involved. |\n| 294 | 17 42 18 | 29 4 | A very small round nebula, with a small star at the north edge, not involved. |\n| 295 | 18 54 3 | 29 45 | A pretty large and very bright nebula, 5' or 6' diameter, irregular round figure, easily resolved into a cluster of small stars, exceedingly compressed at the centre. The bright part at the centre is occasioned by a group of stars of some considerable magnitude when compared with those of the nebula. I am inclined to think that this may be two clusters in the same line; the bright part is a little south of the centre of the large nebula. |\n| 296 | 4 42 11 | 30 40 | A faint ill-defined nebula, with a small bright point in the preceding side, which I suspect to be a star; there are several similar small stars in the field. |\n| 297 | 9 56 0 | 30 50 | A beautiful cluster of stars, arranged in curvilinear lines intersecting each other, about 40' diameter, extended south preceding, and north following. |\n| 298 | 10 47 9 | 30 10 | A very faint nebula, of an oblong rectangular figure, extended in the direction of the meridian. |\n| 299 | 11 22 36 | 30 14 | An extremely faint ray of nebula, about 2' in length, with a very small star at the following extremity; three pretty bright small stars distant about 1', and a star of the 7th magnitude south preceding. |\n| 300 | 12 19 50 | 30 51 | A triangular group of very small stars, about 3' long, resembling faint nebulae.

No particular nebula exists in this place. A group of about twenty stars of mixt magnitudes, forming an irregular figure, about 5' or 6' long, answer to the place of the λ. This is in the milky way; and there is no nebula in the group of stars except what is common in the neighbourhood. |\n| 305 | 17 29 30 | 30 27 | A very small round nebula, with a minute bright point near the following side. The bright point is not in the centre of the nebula, a pretty bright small star following distance 1' of arc. |\n| 306 | 4 9 8    | 31 38 | A small round pretty well defined nebula, 10\" or 12\" diameter, slightly bright to the centre, a bright star in the field south following. |\n| 307 | 4 49 12  | 31 37 | An extremely faint round nebula, 30\" or 40\" diameter. |\n| 308 | 10 15 48 | 31 10 | A very small round nebula, about 25\" diameter, bright at the centre, nearly in a line between two very small stars.

Figure 14. is a very correct representation of it; the circle A B is about 1° and 37' diameter, with the star η in the centre. I can count twelve or fourteen extremely minute stars surrounding η in the space of about 1'; several of them appear close to the disk: there is a pretty bright small star about the 10th magnitude north following the η, and distant about 1'. The nebulosity is pretty strongly marked; that on the south side is very unequal in brightness, and the different portions of the nebulosity are completely detached, as represented in the figure. There is much nebulosity in this place, and very much extensive nebulosity throughout the Robur Caroli, which is also very rich in small stars. |\n| 310 | 10 47 0  | 31 42 | A faint nebula, about 1½' or 2' diameter, with a small bright star near the preceding side; this is resolvable into exceedingly minute stars. |\n| 311 | 12 50 30 | 31 15 | A very faint pretty large nebula, about 6' or 8' diameter, round figure, resolvable into very minute stars. Several stars of some considerable magnitude appear scattered among the minute stars of the nebula, but they are only the continuation of a branch of small stars which run over the place where the nebula is; the stars in the nebula are very gradually, but not much, compressed to the centre. |\n| 312 | 13 16 7  | 31 38 | A pretty large faint nebula, about 5' diameter, irregular branched figure, resolvable, with considerable compression of the stars towards the central point. This precedes a star of the 7th magnitude, and a group of small stars follow, about 10' north of the nebula. |\n| 313 | 14 16 14 | 31 5  | A very minute group of small stars, about 2' long, extended in the parallel of the equator. |\n| 314 | 15 9 —   | 31 29 | (16 Circini, Bode) described in the Connaissance des Tems as nebula, with two small stars in it.

This is described as two small stars in nebula. I can find no nebula in this place; but there are three small stars forming an obtuse triangle, which answers to the place of 47 Indi. There is also an angular line of very minute stars, about 1' in length, following about 2' or 3' in time, and 30' south, which would have a nebulous appearance through a small telescope. |\n| 330 | 9h 22m 30s | 33° 46' | A faint cluster of small stars of mixed magnitude, with two or three pretty bright stars in it. This answers to 485 Argus (Bode), and is described as a small star surrounded by nebula. This precedes 492 Argus, about 3' in RA, and 3' or 4' north of the star, and is probably the object intended; the cluster is about 5' diameter, irregular figure, no nebula. |\n\nMDCCXXVIII.\n| No. | RA h m s | S.P.D. °′″ | Description of the Nebulæ and Stars. |\n|-----|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|\n| 331 | 5 12 30 | 33 37     | A rather bright nebula about 1' diameter, very faint at the margin, gradually bright to the centre; a small star north, and another south, both involved in the margin of the nebula.

Its position is oblique to the equator, south preceding and north following; and its form is nearly that of a parallelogram about two degrees long and fully one degree broad, and may be arranged according to its natural general appearance, into bright, faint, and very faint nebulosity. The bright nebula forms the south extremity and the preceding side, and is equal to the breadth of the nebula at the south end, and gradually diminishing in breadth and brightness till it terminates in an accumulation of the nebulous matter in the north extremity. The bright portion of the nebulous matter is not uniformly bright, but has something the appearance of small cumular clouds, although not very decidedly marked, and which I cannot well delineate. The faint nebula which is on the following side, is broad at the north extremity and gradually diminishing in breadth to where, with the other faint shade, it joins the following side of the brighter portion of the nebula, near the south extremity. The very faint shade is also on the following side, and extends from the northern to the southern extremity of the nebula, and is rather more strongly marked at what I would call its terminating border, than where it joins or blends with the faint shade; and I suspect it is faintly connected with a patch of faint nebula which follows at a little distance, and is represented in the figure.\n\nThere are two pretty bright small nebulae situated in the following margin of the bright shade, and a considerable number of faint nebulae and accumulations of the nebulous matter variously situated throughout, and also in the patch which follows; but they are described in the general catalogue.\nThe figure of the Nebula Major is so irregular, and divided into so many parcels, that without the assistance of letters of reference it will be impossible for me to attempt a description. However, the appearance and construction of the different nebulæ which compose it, are more minutely described in the general catalogue. I will here only attempt to describe the apparent connection of one portion or branch of the nebulous matter with another. I find the existence of extensively diffused faint nebulosity throughout a great portion of this quarter of the heavens, from the Robur Caroli to the Nebula Major, and I can even trace its existence in the vicinity of Nebula Minor.\n\nThe Nebula Major is situated between $4^h\\ 46'$ and $6^h\\ 3'$ in right ascension, and between $66^\\circ\\ 30'$ and $71^\\circ\\ 30'$ of south declination; but the body or principal portion of the nebula is situated between $5^h\\ 7'$ and $5^h\\ 40'$ in right ascension, and between $69^\\circ$ and $71^\\circ$ of south declination, and is composed of very strong bright nebula, very rich in small nebulæ and clustering stars of all the variety of small magnitudes: I compared this portion of the nebula with Sobieski's Shield, which in this latitude is near the zenith. The observation says, \"The Nebula Major very much resembles the brightness in Sobieski's Shield; it is scarcely so large, but I think it is equally bright.\" Another observation says, \"The ridge or brighter portion of Nebula Major is more condensed than the Shield.\" Plate V. is a correct representation of Nebula Major.\n\nThe bright ridge or body of the nebula is extended obliquely to the equator, north preceding and south following, and the following extremity breaks off rather suddenly, faint, decreasing in brightness in a south following direction to the distance of fully a degree and a half towards the star $\\beta$, which is slightly involved in the narrow extremity: preceding the star marked $\\gamma$, a considerable increase of the brightness of the nebulous matter takes place; another accumulation takes place at $\\delta$ about $15'$ diameter. There is a small star north with a small nebula preceding, but neither of them are involved in the accumulation of the nebulous matter. $\\delta$ and $\\varepsilon$ are connected by streams of unequal brightness, $\\varepsilon$ is pretty large and is rich in small stars and nebulæ: opposite $\\delta$ and $\\varepsilon$, towards the principal body of the nebula, the nebulous matter is very faint and of unequal brightness; $\\varepsilon$ is south following a beautiful group of nebulæ of various forms and magnitudes, on a ground of strong nebulosity common to all, with the 30 Doradûs (Bode) in the centre,\nSouth of the 30 Doradûs a pretty bright accumulation of the nebulous matter takes place, extended, preceding and following, and is joined by pretty strong nebula to the arm \\( z \\), which proceeds in a northerly direction from the body of the nebula; the bright star near the north extremity of the arm is not involved in the bright nebula. Between the arms \\( z \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) the nebula is very faint, and the bright accumulations of the nebulous matter on the north side are all connected together by nebulosity of various brightness, and are connected to the main body by the arms \\( z \\) and \\( \\lambda \\); and I strongly suspect the nebula at \\( \\phi \\) is connected by very faint nebula with the group surrounding the 30 Doradûs.\n\nThe accumulation of the nebulous matter at \\( \\xi \\) is connected with the preceding extremity of the body of the nebula, by nebula increasing in brightness towards the neck of the body, but I cannot say that the \\( \\psi \\) is connected with the \\( \\xi \\).\n\nTwo arms proceed from the neck towards the south, which are connected by faint nebula between them, which gradually increases in brightness towards the junction of the arms; between the arm \\( \\eta \\) and the body the nebulosity is faint, of various shades of brightness, and from the arms \\( \\eta \\) and \\( \\nu \\), to the head \\( \\xi \\), the nebulosity is of various degrees of brightness.\n\nI have made a very good general representation of the various appearances of the milky way, from the Robur Caroli to where it crosses the zenith in Scorpio. Plates VI. VII. and VIII. This was generally made by the naked eye, except in particular places where I suspected an opening or separation of the nebulous matter, when I applied the telescope. However, the dark space on the east side of the Cross, or the black cloud as it is called, is very accurately laid down by the telescope: the darkness in this space is occasioned by a vacancy or want of stars; it contains only two or three of the 7th magnitude, and very few of the 8th or 9th magnitude. I may here remark that the Nebula Minor is not so bright as the Nebula Major.\n\nNeither of the two nebulæ, Major and Minor, are at present in the place assigned to them by Lacaille; and it has been suspected that nebulous appearances change their form and also their situation. Yet, although the situation of these nebulæ, as given by Lacaille and compared with their present situation, would be favourable to such a surmise, still we must consider the dimensions of the instruments with which he made his observations, and make a reasonable allowance.\nHowever, the 30 Doradûs is at present involved in pretty strong and pretty bright nebula, and is also situated very near the brightest part of the Nebula Major; and it would be singular if its relative situation was the same when Lacaille observed it as it at present is; that he should have assigned to it a place in the Dorado and not in the Nebula Major, to which, from its nature, it was not only nearly allied, but in which it was actually involved. This circumstance, it must be confessed, is favourable to the conjecture; and the 47 Toucani is similarly situated, with respect to distance, from the Nebula Minor, although it is not involved in nebulosity or connected with the nebula.\n\nWhen reflecting on these circumstances, I was led to examine the present state of these nebulæ, and find that scarcely any nebulæ exist in a high state of condensation, and very few in a state of moderate condensation towards the centre. A considerable number appear a little brighter towards the centre, and several have minute bright points immediately at the centre. Others have small or very minute stars variously situated in them, but many of those bright points in, or near, the centre may be stars, for the Nebula Major in particular is very rich in small stars. But the greater number of the nebulæ appear only like condensations of the general nebulous matter, into faint nebulæ of various forms and magnitudes, generally not well defined; and many of the larger nebulous appearances are resolvable into stars of mixed small magnitudes; and a great portion of the large cloud is resolvable into innumerable stars of all the variety of small magnitudes with strong nebula remaining, very similar to the brighter parts of the milky way. And whether the remaining nebulous appearance may not be occasioned by millions of stars disguised by their distance, is what I cannot say.\n\nBut a critical examination of these nebulæ would not only be a valuable treasure for the present generation to possess, but an invaluable inheritance for them to transmit to posterity. For it must be by the comparison of observations, made at distant periods of time, that we can draw any satisfactory conclusions concerning the breaking up or the greater condensation of the nebulous matter. It seems beyond a doubt that stars must assume a nebulous appearance when situated at immense distances; but whether all nebulous appearances are occasioned by stars, is a problem apparently beyond the reach of man to resolve, without the assistance of analogy, which ought not to be\ntrusted too freely, especially with objects almost equally beyond the reach of our hands and telescopes. Several of the very faint and delicate nebulæ can be resolved into stars, and also many of the brighter nebulæ are composed of stars: but there are a greater number which have not yet been resolved or shown to consist of stars; and it is not improbable, that \"shining matter may exist in a state different from that of the starry.\"\n\nJames Dunlop.\n\nP.S. Plate IX. has been added, at the suggestion of Mr. Herschel, to illustrate the distribution of the Southern Nebulae. The nebulæ are laid down without any regard to their form, magnitude, brightness, or nature; and but little to their strict places, only so far as to cause every rectangular space on the map, which occupies one degree in Polar distance and one hour in Right ascension, to contain the same number of nebulæ as actually occur in the heavens, according to the observations detailed in this paper; the object of the plate being solely to give an idea of their arrangement generally in the heavens.",
