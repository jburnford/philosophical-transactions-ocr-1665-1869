Read April 25. THE Boy was regular as other Children, till about a Year ago, when this extraordinary Craving of Appetite first began; which afflicts him to such a Degree, that (they tell us) if he was not fed as he called out for it, he would gnaw the very Flesh off his own Bones; so that, when awake, he is constantly devouring; it can hardly be said eating, because nothing passes his Stomach, all is thrown up again.
