III. Part of a Letter from Mr N. Regnart, concerning a Pin found in the Gizzard of a Fowl.

Sir,

I cannot but take notice to you of a particular accident, that seems to deserve your Observation: Which is, that in cutting the Stomach or Gizzard of a Fowl, finding something refisted my Knife, upon examining it farther, I discover'd it to be a Pin, which the Pullet had swallowed,
and in all probability had lain in her some time: For it had pierced thro the Membrane on the inside, and made a passage into the thick part, where it had form'd itself a Bed. It is observable, that the head of the Pin had past thro the first shrive'l'd Membrane, but stopt at the second, which seem'd more thick and Nervous; so that the Head remain'd inclosed between the two Membranes, the Body of it having made its way into the fleshy Muscular part. At the point there was form'd a Callus, of the bigness of a small Pea, which seem'd a defence, that Nature had made to oppose it, as it was working itself farther.

It is not in the least strange that a Pin should lye in the fleshy parts, since we see a Musquet-Ball will lye there a considerable time, without much injuring the part; but how it should pass thro the Membranes of the Stomach, without obstructing its functions, and the Pullet thrive well after it, I leave you to determine.
