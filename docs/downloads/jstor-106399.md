ADDENDA.

At the end of page 386 add,

In fig. 4, draw a circle through the points N, M, T; and at the maximum where TP² = PM × NP this circle will touch CA produced in T. From E the center of this circle draw EF perpendicular to NM, also the radii EN and EM; and FN is the sine of NEE, or half NEM, or of its equal MTN, to the radius EN. But EN = ET = FF = \(\frac{PN + PM}{2}\), and FN = \(\frac{PN - PM}{2}\). Therefore PN + PM is to PN - PM, or CD + CB is to CD - CB, or CA + CB is to CA - CB, as radius is to the sine of the greatest angle of deviation, which is therefore equal to \(\frac{CA - CB}{CA + CB}\), radius being unity.
