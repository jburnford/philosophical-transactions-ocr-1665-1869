And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued.\n\nBut the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable that a Committee of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752. And the grounds of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgement of their respective authors.\n\nIt is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body, upon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore the\nthanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communications. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions, and curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors whereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report and even to certify in the public newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation. And therefore it is hoped that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports and public notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited, to the dishonour of the Society.\n\nThe Meteorological Journal hitherto kept by the Assistant Secretary at the Apartments of the Royal Society, by order of the President and Council, and published in the Philosophical Transactions, has been discontinued. The Government, on the recommendation of the President and Council, has established at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, under the superintendence of the Astronomer Royal, a Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory, where observations are made on an extended scale, which are regularly published. These, which correspond with the grand scheme of observations now carrying out in different parts of the globe, supersede the necessity of a continuance of the observations made at the Apartments of the Royal Society, which could not be rendered so perfect as was desirable, on account of the imperfections of the locality and the multiplied duties of the observer.\nA List of Public Institutions and Individuals, entitled to receive a copy of the Philosophical Transactions of each year, on making application for the same directly or through their respective agents, within five years of the date of publication.\n\nObservatories.\n\n| Armagh | Kew |\n|--------|-----|\n| Cape of Good Hope | Liverpool |\n| Dublin | Madras |\n| Edinburgh | Oxford (Radcliffe) |\n| Greenwich | |\n\nInstitutions.\n\n| Barbadoes | Library and Museum. |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| Calcutta | Asiatic Society. |\n| | Geological Museum. |\n| Cambridge | Philosophical Society. |\n| Cape Town | South African Library. |\n| Dublin | Royal Dublin Society. |\n| | Royal Irish Academy. |\n| Edinburgh | Royal Society. |\n| London | Admiralty Library. |\n| | Chemical Society. |\n| | Entomological Society. |\n| | Geological Society. |\n| | Geological Survey of Great Britain. |\n| | Horticultural Society. |\n| | Institute of British Architects. |\n| | Institution of Civil Engineers. |\n| | Linnean Society. |\n| | London Institution. |\n| | Queen's Library. |\n| | Royal Asiatic Society. |\n| | Royal Astronomical Society. |\n| | Royal College of Physicians. |\n| | Royal Geographical Society. |\n| | Royal Institution of Great Britain. |\n| | Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. |\n| | Royal Society of Literature. |\n| | Society of Antiquaries. |\n| | Society of Arts. |\n| | The Treasury Library. |\n| | United Service Museum. |\n| | Zoological Society. |\n| Malta | Public Library. |\n| Manchester | Literary and Philosophical Society. |\n| Oxford | Ashmolean Society. |\n| | Radcliffe Library. |\n| Swansea | Royal Institution. |\n| Sydney | University Library. |\n| Woolwich | Royal Artillery Library. |\n\nBelgium.\n\n| Brussels | Académie Royale de Médecine. |\n| | Royal Academy of Sciences. |\n\nDenmark.\n\n| Altona | Royal Observatory. |\n| Copenhagen | Royal Society of Sciences. |\n\nFrance.\n\n| Montpellier | Academy of Sciences. |\n| | Faculté de Médecine. |\n| Paris | Academy of Sciences. |\n| | Dépôt de la Marine. |\n| | École des Mines. |\n| | Geographical Society. |\n| | Geological Society. |\n| | Jardin des Plantes. |\n| | Société d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale. |\n| Toulouse | Academy of Sciences. |\n\nGermany.\n\n| Berlin | Royal Academy of Sciences. |\n| | Society of Experimental Philosophy. |\n| Jena | Cesarean Acad. of Naturalists. |\n| Frankfort | Natural History Society. |\n| Giessen | University. |\n| Göttingen | University. |\n| Hamburg | Naturwissenschaftlicher-Verein. |\n| Königsberg | Königlichen Physikalisch Ökonomischen Gesellschaft. |\n| Leipzig | Royal Saxon Society of Sciences. |\n| Mannheim | Observatory. |\n| Munich | Royal Academy of Sciences. |\n| Prague | Bohemian Society of Sciences. |\n| Vienna | Imperial Academy of Sciences. |\n| | Geologische Reichsanstalt. |\n| Würzburg | Physico-Medical Society. |\n\nHungary.\n\n| Pesth | Hungarian Academy of Sciences. |\n\nItaly.\n\n| Catanea | Accademia Gioenia di Scienze Naturali. |\n| Milan | Institute of Sciences, Letters and Arts. |\n| Modena | Italian Society of Sciences. |\n| Naples | Institute of Sciences. |\n| Palermo | Academy of Sciences and Letters. |\n| Rome | Academy de' Nuovi Lincei. |\n| | Collegio Romano. |\n| Turin | Royal Academy of Sciences. |\n| Venice | Institute of Sciences, Letters, and Arts. |\n\nJava.\n\n| Batavia | Batavian Society of Sciences. |\n\nNetherlands.\n\n| Amsterdam | Royal Institute. |\n| Haarlem | Dutch Society of Sciences. |\n| Rotterdam | Batavian Society of Experimental Philosophy. |\n\nPortugal.\n\n| Lisbon | Royal Academy of Sciences. |\n\nRussia.\n\n| Kazan | Imperial University. |\n| Moscow | Imperial Society of Naturalists. |\n| Pulkowa | Observatory. |\n| St. Petersburg | Imperial Academy of Sciences. |\n\nSpain.\n\n| Cadiz | Observatory. |\n| Madrid | Royal Academy of Sciences. |\n\nSweden and Norway.\n\n| Christiania | Royal University. |\n| Drontheim | Royal Society of Sciences. |\n| Gottenburg | Kongl.
