VIII. Extract of a Letter from Bombay, dated January 23. 1743-4. communicated by Francis Woolaston, Esquire, F. R. S. of a Porcupine swallowed by a Snake.

Read Jan. 31. SOME time ago there was found, on an Island adjacent to this, a large Snake, dead, with a Porcupine in its Belly. Perhaps you may not know, that a Snake always sucks in its Food by degrees. This had seized the Porcupine by the Head; and had so sucked it in. When it was quite in, the Quills, which were flatted down whilst it was going in, rose; ran through the Snake's Belly; and killed it: So that there was a monstrous large Snake dead, with the Quills of a Porcupine sticking out of it in many Places.
