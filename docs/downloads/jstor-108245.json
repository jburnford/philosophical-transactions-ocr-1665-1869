Graves, Esq., A.M., F.R.S., of the Inner Temple.\n\nReceived January 14,—Read February 11, 1841.\n\nThe principal object of the calculations contained in the following paper, is to investigate the figure which a fluid, consisting of portions varying in density according to any given law, would assume, when every particle is acted upon by the attraction of every other and by a centrifugal force arising from rotatory motion. To what extent this may have been the original condition of the earth, is a doubtful question; and although observation does not fully warrant this supposition of the regular arrangement of parts, it has necessarily been made the foundation of most of the mathematical calculations connected with the investigation. Before proceeding to this problem, it is necessary to calculate the attraction of a body of any given figure, and consisting of strata, varying in their densities according to any given law; and it is in this problem that the principal difficulty lies. The elegant method of solution discovered by Laplace is well known; and I have followed his steps as far as the point where the equation, known by his name, first appears. In order to illustrate the nature of the deviation which I have there made, it will be necessary to mention some of the principal steps of the two methods.\n\nBy means of a theorem, which Laplace laid down as true of all spheroids that differ but little from spheres, and the properties of the integral of the equation referred to, he was enabled to substitute the easy rules of differentiation for the more complicated inverse processes, and thus to compute the attraction of that class of figures. It has, however, been since discovered by Mr. Ivory, that this theorem is true only of spheroids of a particular kind; and, consequently, to this kind the solution of the problem is restricted. This defect, and the indirectness of his analysis, led other mathematicians to consider the question; and, in 1811, Mr. Ivory published his method, which has the great advantage of being more direct, though equally limited.\n\nThe method given in the following paper does not appear to be confined in its operation to any particular class of spheroids; since the coefficients of the series, into which the required function is developed, are determined absolutely, without any reference to the form of the spheroid to which they are about to be applied. The principal change consists in the different manner of treating this partial differential equation. Laplace and the subsequent writers on this equation, both as applied to the\ncalculation of attractions and the mathematical theory of electricity, suppose the coefficients of every term of the series to be expanded into another series of the sines and cosines of multiple arcs; and they avail themselves of the property which these terms possess of vanishing, in certain cases, when integrated between certain limits. The success of this plan, however, depends upon the restricting hypothesis above referred to, that the radius vector of the surface of the body is capable of expansion in a series of terms, each of which satisfies Laplace's equation. The following method shows that the coefficient of the general term of the first series is independent of one of the variables, and thus dispenses with the second series of expansions. This result I have arrived at, by first obtaining the integral of Laplace's equation in its most general form, and deducing the arbitrary functions introduced therein, from considerations which enter previous to the equation of the surface of the attracting body. These coefficients being known, it is evident that the attraction of any homogeneous body on a point within or without it may be immediately found when the equation of its surface is given, since it then depends only on a series of explicit and definite integrations of known functions, which can always be effected, at least approximately. From this, the attraction of a heterogeneous body, similarly circumstanced, may be found by the usual method of dividing it into concentric layers, and summing the several attractions of these, deduced as above.\n\nBy substituting the attraction so obtained, in the equation of equilibrium of a fluid body, Clairaut's theorem is immediately deduced; and, from a peculiarity in the functions representing the attraction, it will be seen, that the same principles with longer processes may be carried on indefinitely, without the necessity of actually determining the precise form of those functions.\n\nThe restricted species of spheroid above referred to, comprises all surfaces of revolution; so that it is sufficiently extensive for most practical purposes; but the integration of Laplace's equation renders the analysis more direct, and the theory more complete.\n\nOn the General Problem of Attractions.\n\n1. Let $\\rho$ represent the density of a body at the point $(x, y, z)$; and let $f, g, h$ be the coordinates of a particle attracted by the body, parallel respectively to the axes $x, y, z$; then, if the power of attraction be inversely as the square of the distance, the resolved part of the attraction of the body, parallel to\n\n$$x \\text{ is } \\iiint \\frac{\\rho (f - x) dx dy dz}{\\{(f - x)^2 + (g - y)^2 + (h - z)^2\\}^{3/2}},$$\n\n$$y \\text{ is } \\iiint \\frac{\\rho (g - y) dx dy dz}{\\{(f - x)^2 + (g - y)^2 + (h - z)^2\\}^{3/2}},$$\n\n$$z \\text{ is } \\iiint \\frac{\\rho (h - z) dx dy dz}{\\{(f - x)^2 + (g - y)^2 + (h - z)^2\\}^{3/2}},$$\nthe limits of integration being determined by the equation to the surface of the body.\n\n2. Let $V$ represent the sum of the products of each particle by the reciprocal of its distance from the attracted point.\n\nThen $V = \\iiint \\frac{\\varrho \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz}{\\{(f-x)^2 + (g-y)^2 + (h-z)^2\\}^{1/2}}$; and, by differentiating $V$, we obtain the well-known property $\\frac{d^2 V}{df^2} + \\frac{d^2 V}{dg^2} + \\frac{d^2 V}{dh^2} = 0$, or $-4\\pi \\varepsilon'$, according as the attracted particle is not or is within the attracting mass; $\\varepsilon'$ being in the latter case the density of the attracted particle*. By transforming these equations to polar coordinates, we obtain\n\n$$\\frac{d^2 V}{dr^2} + \\frac{2}{r} \\frac{dV}{dr} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d^2 V}{d\\theta^2} + r^2 \\cot \\theta \\frac{dV}{d\\theta} + \\frac{1}{r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta} \\frac{d^2 V}{d\\phi^2} = 0,$$\n\nor $-4\\pi \\varepsilon'$,\n\nand\n\n$$V = \\int_0^r \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\varrho \\, r'^2 \\, dr' \\, \\sin \\theta' \\, d\\theta' \\, d\\phi'}{\\{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'(\\cos \\theta \\cos \\theta' + \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta' \\cos (\\phi - \\phi'))\\}^{1/2}},$$\n\nwhere $r^2 = f^2 + g^2 + h^2$, $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{f^2 + g^2 + h^2}}$, $\\tan \\phi = \\frac{g}{f}$; and similar expressions are true of $r'$, $\\theta'$, and $\\phi'$ in terms of $x$, $y$, $z$.\n\nPut $\\cos \\theta = \\mu$, and $\\cos \\theta' = \\mu'$, and they become\n\n$$r \\frac{d^2 (r \\, V)}{dr^2} + \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left( (1 - \\mu^2) \\frac{dV}{d\\mu} \\right) + \\frac{1}{1 - \\mu^2} \\frac{d^2 V}{d\\phi^2} = 0,$$\n\nor $-4\\pi \\varepsilon' r^2$†.\n\n3. Expansion by the binomial theorem shows that\n\n$$\\{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'(\\mu \\mu' + \\sqrt{(1 - \\mu^2)} \\sqrt{(1 - \\mu'^2)} \\cos (\\phi - \\phi'))\\}^{1/2}$$\n\nmay be expressed either in powers of $r$ or of $r'$; thus\n\n$$P_0 \\frac{1}{r^j} + P_1 \\frac{r}{r^2} + \\ldots + P_n \\frac{r^n}{r^{n+1}} + \\ldots,$$\n\nor $P_0 \\frac{1}{r} + P_1 \\frac{r}{r^3} + P_2 \\frac{r^2}{r^5} + \\ldots + P_n \\frac{r^n}{r^{n+1}} + \\ldots,$\n\nwhere $P_n$ is a symmetrical function of $\\mu$, $\\sqrt{(1 - \\mu^2)} \\cos \\phi$, $\\sqrt{(1 - \\mu^2)} \\sin \\phi$ on the one part, and $\\mu'$, $\\sqrt{(1 - \\mu'^2)} \\cos \\phi'$, $\\sqrt{(1 - \\mu'^2)} \\sin \\phi'$ on the other.\n\nBy substituting the first expansion in (2.), and the value of $V$ so obtained in (1.), we have a series of equations\n\n$$\\int_0^r \\int_{-1}^1 \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\varepsilon' \\left\\{ \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left( (1 - \\mu^2) \\frac{dP_n}{d\\mu} \\right) + \\frac{1}{1 - \\mu^2} \\frac{d^2 P_n}{d\\phi^2} + n(n+1) P_n \\right\\} \\frac{dr' \\, d\\mu' \\, d\\phi'}{r'^{n-1}} = 0,$$\n\nexcept when $n = 2$; and in all cases\n\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left( (1 - \\mu^2) \\frac{dP_n}{d\\mu} \\right) + \\frac{1}{1 - \\mu^2} \\frac{d^2 P_n}{d\\phi^2} + n(n+1) P_n = 0,$$\n\nwhich is the equation of Laplace's coefficients.\n\n* Vide Pratt. Mec. Phil., § 168. Laplace, Méc. Cél. liv. iii. † Vide Pratt. Mec. Phil., § 169.\n4. This equation was not integrated; but by a skilful use of its properties, the problem of attractions was greatly simplified by Laplace. He laid down a theorem, respecting the surfaces of all spheroids of small deviation, that their radii vectors might be developed into series, every term of which would satisfy the above equation; and he also gave a method of expansion. By means of this theorem, the problem could be solved for spheroidal bodies which differ but little from spheres; but its generality has been greatly restricted by the researches of subsequent writers*, by whom it has been shown that it is true only for bodies whose radii are expressible in rational and integral functions of $\\mu'$, $\\sqrt{(1 - \\mu'^2)} \\cos \\phi'$, $\\sqrt{(1 - \\mu'^2)} \\sin \\phi'$. Among these are the ellipsoid and elliptical spheroid, and a large class of other spheroids. In these papers I have adopted a different proceeding; I integrate the equation itself generally, and determine the arbitrary functions contained in the integrals by the circumstances of the problem itself. In consequence of the peculiar form which $P_n$ then takes, $V$ may be found by effecting the operations indicated, which are only explicit integrations.\n\n5. I shall now proceed to integrate this equation.\n\nConsider $\\mu$ and $\\phi$ as functions of two new variables $X$ and $Y$, to be determined from the equations,\n\n$$dX = \\frac{dX}{d\\phi} (d\\phi + k d\\mu)$$\n\n$$dY = \\frac{dY}{d\\phi} (d\\phi + k' d\\mu),$$\n\nwhere $k$ and $k'$ are the roots of the equation $(1 - \\mu^2) k^2 + \\frac{1}{1 - \\mu^2} = 0$.

Let $\\psi \\varphi = \\frac{c}{2}$, then\n\n$$P_n = c \\left( \\ldots \\int \\cos^{-2} \\frac{Y-X}{2} \\int \\cos^{-2} \\frac{Y-X}{2} \\int \\frac{1}{2} \\cos^{-2} \\frac{Y-X}{2} dY dY \\ldots (n \\text{ times}) \\right).$$\n\nEffecting these integrations, we find that $P_n$ consists of a series of powers of\n\n$$\\ast \\text{ The common differential equation } (1-\\mu^2) \\frac{d^3 P_n}{d \\mu^3} - 2\\mu \\frac{d P_n}{d \\mu} + n(n+1) P_n = 0 \\text{ will illustrate this point.}$$\n\nLet $P_n = \\frac{d^n z}{d \\mu^n}$, and after substitution, differentiate $n$ times; then $(1-\\mu^2) \\frac{d^3 z}{d \\mu^3} - 2(n+1)\\mu \\frac{d z}{d \\mu} = 0$, whence\n\n$$z = \\int \\frac{k d \\mu}{(1-\\mu^2)^n+1} + m.$$ It is clear that no more arbitrary constants than $k$ and $m$ can be introduced; and yet if the integrals were left indefinite, we might obtain an integral of an expression which should differ from the integral of the same expression obtained by a slightly different process, by a constant.
