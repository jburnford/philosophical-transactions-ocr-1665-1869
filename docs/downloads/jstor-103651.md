on the Ends of the Bones are chiefly fastened to them by the Periosteum; which being taken off, they easily fall asunder. 'Tis a Mistake, that we vulgarly think this is done by means of an intermediate Cartilage: The Truth is, both the Epiphyses and Ends of the Bones, at first, are cartilaginous; but in Time become bony, and then are only joined by the Periosteum.
