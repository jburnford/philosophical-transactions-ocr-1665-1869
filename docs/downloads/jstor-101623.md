sages between the medullar Filaments be open'd, or shut, and that more or less; or lastly, whether it be, that the Spirits are variously disposed, whilst the Medulla of the Brain remains in the same state? 7. Discourseth of Sleep and Waking; where he very curiously observeth, first, How far there is in Sleep a Cessation of Sense and Motion; and how Night-walkings and Respiration (two very strong Motions) are performed in Sleep: Secondly, What is the immediate cause of that Cessation, viz., a scanty and alter'd influx of the Spirits into the Organs of outward Sense. 8. Affirbeth the exact knowledge of the Medulla Spinalis to that excellent English Physitian and Anatomist Dr. Willis. 9. Explains the order in which the several Combinations of the Nerves do proceed, out of the Medullar Mass of the Brain, into and through the whole Body. 10. Concludeth the whole with an Explication of the Affections and Diseases of the Brain; and shews, first, How the various Head-aches are caused by the various qualities of the parts that compose the Blood, which being either bilious, sulphureous, salin, aqueous, or terrestrial, do accordingly cause lacera ting, pricking, vellicating, or heavy pains: Secondly, How the Dropsy of the Brain is caused by the copious ferocities gather'd between the Membrans of it. Thirdly, How Ulcers, Obstructions, and Inflammations are produced. Fourthly, How those many Perturbations and Symptoms are occasioned in the Brain, as Sadness, Fear, sleepiness, Madness, Forgetfulness; Epilepsy's, Apoplexy's, among which two last he finds this difference, that an Epilepsy is not necessarily preceded by any Obstruction; an irritation and an offensive afflux to the Sensible parts, being able to produce it alone; whereas an Apoplexy never comes without an Obstruction of the Spirits. Fifthly, How Palpy's are caused, viz. by an influx of impure Spirits from the Origine of the Nerves into the beginnings of the same. Sixthly, How overmuch Watching is occasioned, namely by over-hot Spirits; as an Un-natural Sleep is produced by thick, torpid and cold vapors, intermingled with the Spirits, &c.

In Numb.65,p.2014.l.17.del.first,and read, were started. Besides, the Reader is desired, not to be offended at the oversight of the Printer, who in this same Tract of N 65, when he should have numbered page 2107, did print 2007; whereby some confusion would arise in the Index, that is to follow, if therein the Publisher did not intend to prevent it in some measure by quoting as well the Number of these Tracts as the page. In this Numb.67,p.2040.l.17. del. Farewell.
