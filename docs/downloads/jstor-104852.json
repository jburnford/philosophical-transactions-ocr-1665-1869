It was in a horizontal Direction North of the Sun, and from it projected a long luminous Ray, which terminated in a Point.—It continu'd very strong for more than half an Hour after I saw it, and then vanish'd away by degrees.\n\nP.

Extract of a Letter from Mr. Benjamin Cooke F.R.S. to Mr. Peter Collinson F.R.S. concerning the Property of new Flanel sparkling in the dark.\n\nNewport, Isle of Wight, Jan. 13. 1746-7.\n\nRead March 19.
