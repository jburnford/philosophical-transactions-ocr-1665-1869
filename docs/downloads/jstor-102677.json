  "text": "Town: The Waves came rolling down, like long Swarms of Grass, one upon another, to use the Metaphor of the Relater, who had never seen the Sea. Several Houses were utterly ruin'd, and others wreckt up to the Chamber Windows; one particularly so covered, that a great piece of the Rock was left upon the top of the Chimney. These things my Neighbour was an Eye-Witness of, and had many a weary day in clearing some part of his Land. His House was, for some time, full of Neighbours, who were harbourless by this sudden Accident.\n\nLeeds, August 20, 1705.\n\nV. Observations of the Solar Eclipse, May 1st, 1706\nAt the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, &c. communicated by the Reverend Mr John Flamsted, Math. Reg. & F. R. S.\n\nThe Morning was Cloudy and Moist till about eight a clock, when the Clouds began to break, and we had sometimes a sight of the Sun through the spaces betwixt them. A Sevenfoot Telescope was fitted up with a Scene to receive the Species of the Sun cast through it, and on which it was about seven inches diameter, divided into digits by six concentrick Circles. But Clouds coming, the Sun frequently rendered this way of observing inconvenient, and therefore laying aside the Apparatus of the Scene, I viewed him through the same Telescope with Smoaked Glasses, to save my Eyes, and Noted:\n\n1706.\n1706.

And I take notice of it to you, because it infers that the Moon has an Atmosphere; and its short continuance of only 6 or 7 Seconds of Time, tells us that its height is not more than the 5 or 6 hundredth part of her diameter.\n\nVI. An Abstract of a Letter written from Geneva, May the 31st, 1706. N. S. by Monsieur J. Chr. Facio Duillier, R. S. S. to his Brother Mr Nic. Facio, R. S. S. Containing some Observations of the Sun's Eclipse, on the 12th of May, 1706. N. S.\n\nThe total Eclipse of the Sun, which happened on the 12th of May, 1706. N. S., did present to the Inhabitants of Geneva a magnificent and surprizing Sight. The more Learned did observe that Eclipse with much Satisfaction: But it did strike many of the Common People with a great deal of Terror. A little after the Sun's rising, the Sky did seem clear; tho the Air was thick already with some Vapours. Many little Clouds did afterwards arise here and there, and the Vapours did much increase. For want of a Pendulum Clock, in a convenient place, the Moment of the total Immersion, the Moment of the first Emersion, and that of the End of the Eclipse, could not be accurately observed. Tho the Sky was somewhat overcast, the Heat of the Sun was already felt, when the Eclipse did begin: But a very sensible Coldness took place, as the Moon did, by degrees, cover",
