The people of that Countrey are so very careful, to have the Corn well dried, before they put it into those Subterraneous Granaries, that, when the weather of that Northern Climat serves not to dry it sufficiently, they heat their Barns, by the means of great Ovens, and thereby very well drying their Corn, supply the deficiency of their short Summer.\n\nInquiries For Hungary and Transylvania.\n\nIn prosecution of the Engagement, published Numb. 23. p. 414, 422. we now subjoyn some other Inquiries, and first these, that were very lately recommended to a studious and inquisitive Transylvanian, who from London returned to his Countrey, and promised to procure good Answers to the following particulars, Viz.\n\n1.

To observe how deep these Salt-mines lie from the surface of the Ground? How deep they are digg'd hitherto; and what Damps are met within them, &c?\n\n7. To inquire after the Veins of Gold and Quick-silver at Cremnitz in Hungary; and the Vein of Silver at Schemnitz in the same Kingdom: And to send over some of the best Ores of them?\n\n8. To inquire, Whether the Waters of the Therme, that pass by Schemnitz, depose a certain sediment, which in time turns into a yellow Stone?\n\n9.

Whether there be Springs about Buda or Alba Regalis, that rise at the bottom of the River so hot, that those who go to bathe, dare not put their feet so low as the Sand, for fear of having them parboyled?\n\n15. Whether there be in Hungary an Avernus, that exhaleth almost always such poisonous Steams, that Birds flying over it, do often-times fall down, either stupified, or quite dead?\n\n16.

Whether it rain there at any time, and if so, what time of the Year? Whether Rain make the Air wholesome, or pestilential, or otherwise unhealthful?\n\n2. To consider the Niter that is commonly sold there, and what affinity there is betwixt that, and our common Saltpeeter: to try by dissolving it in warm water, filtering it well, then boiling almost half away, and putting the remainder in an earthen Pan, and setting it in a cool place for two days, to see whether it will shoot into Crystals of Peeter.
