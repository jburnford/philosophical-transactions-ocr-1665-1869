The latter part of February was stormy, and wet; but, from thence to the beginning of May, there was a great deal of fine weather, dry, and a very good seed time; and the grain came up very friendly: yet the dryness of the season, and several frosty mornings, even till near the middle of May, made the grass, and other things, very backward.\n\nThe beginning of May many were apprehensive of a drought, and the first rains were very acceptable; but so exceedingly wet a fortnight followed, with great floods, and the fens drowned, that all were as much tired of rain, as before they desired it, and the crops of grain never recovered it. In the rest of the year there were many fits of great wet, but intermixed with fits of fair and fine. The wet of May was beyond example at that time of year. Just the end of May, and almost half June, were pretty fine; but then came wet again, till the beginning of July. The longest fine season was the chief part of July and August, and in that time the great crop of hay was well got, as also the first part of harvest; and some rains, at times, kept things in a growing state. The latter part of harvest, in September, was wet, but not so bad as last year, and the harvest was more hindered than hurt by it. The wheat seed-time, in the middle of October, was good; but most part of the autumn was wet, especially the latter part of October, and first half of November. Toward the latter part of November, there was a smart, but short, frost; and another longer, but more broken, the beginning of December.\nber; and, by the middle of that month, the ground was got considerably drier than it had been; but it grew very wet again, and misty, till three sharp frosty days concluded the year.\n\nThis year was much too wet for corn; the barley was almost everywhere bad; the wheat and beans looked better in the field; but most sorts of grain, when they came to be threshed, this year yielded less corn, than was expected; and it continues to be dear, and is too likely to be so, while the seasons are so wet as they have of late years been.",
