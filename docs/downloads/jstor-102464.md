I had the Curiosity to try whether I could find any Blood in them, but did not; which makes me think they feed of the same Humour they are bred of.

V. Part of a Letter from Mr. Edw. Lhwyd, to Dr. Lister; giving some farther Account of the Fiery Exhalation in Merionydh-shire.

Honoured Sir,

I Discoursed with an Intelligent Sober Person, that lives near Harlech in Merionydh-shire, who assured me the Fire still continues there; that it is observed to come from a place called Morva bychan in Caernarvonshire, about Eight or Nine Miles off, [over part of the Sea.] That Cattle of all sorts, as Sheep, Goats, Hogs, Cows, and Horses, still dye apace; and that for certain, any great Noise, as Winding of Horns, Drums, &c. does repel it from any House, or Barn, or Stacks of Hay; upon account of which Remedy, they have had few or no Losses in that kind since Christmas. That it happened during this Summer, at least one Night in a Week, and that commonly either Saturday or Sunday; but that now of late it appears something oftner. The place whence it proceeds is both Sandy and Marshy. This is all I could gather from him, material.
