This was done for the Concerns of a Private Family; but because it may be of some use to the Naturalist, Dr. Lister was willing to part with it. It was twice as long again, but scarce any thing but Repetitions of the same things in Nature, and therefore he Transcribed no more; but this is as it were a Specimen.\n\nIII. Situs",
