  "text": "XIX. On a New Method of Approximation applicable to Elliptic and Ultra-elliptic Functions.—Second Memoir*. By Charles W. Merrifield. Communicated by W. Spottiswoode, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nReceived March 20,—Read April 3, 1862.\n\nSince my first memoir on this subject was read before the Society, Mr. Sylvester has published a method, more general than mine, of applying rational approximation to facilitate the computation of the integrals of irrational functions. This method, at which he had arrived independently, included, à majori, the one which was the subject of my memoir. Aided by his papers, my subsequent studies have enabled me to view the method with more generality, as well as with more precision and completeness of detail, and I am now able to present it in a sufficiently finished and practical form for the immediate use of the computer. I have also computed auxiliary Tables, to render its application easier in certain cases.\n\nAny rational formula, which gives approximately the value of a function to be integrated, may be integrated in lieu of it, and the result will in general be an approximate value of the integral sought. But for such a process to be of any practical utility, the convergence of the formula must be excessive, for the complexity of the integral forms is so great that the labour would be enormous, unless the terms were very few in number. In the discovery of formulæ sufficiently convergent for the purpose, lies the success of the method.\n\nWe are by no means restricted to functions under a square root, or even to pure radical forms at all. The principle applies with equal generality to functions which are given implicitly as roots of equations, and thus to a class of differential equations; and Mr. Sylvester has well remarked that these formulæ not only afford facilities for computation, as by a method of quadratures, but also enable us to assign superior and inferior limits to an integral, without losing its generality of form.\n\nI shall begin with the approximation to the square root, giving it in its general form, and explaining its exact analytical signification. I shall then show its application to Elliptic Functions, and how, in the ordinary cases, certain simple reductions can be effected, which greatly lessen the labour of computation; and I shall give these reductions for the cases more commonly occurring, with some examples and working formulæ. I shall then add a short account of the extension of the method.\n\nThe paragraphs in the first two sections of this paper bear a consecutive number for convenience of reference.\n\n* For the First Memoir, see the Philosophical Transactions for 1860, p. 223.\nSection I.—Approximants to the Square Root.\n\n1. Mr. Sylvester gives, for the approximants to the square root, the following statement:\n\n\"Let \\( r \\) be an approximate value of \\( \\sqrt{N} \\); then by that mode of application of Newton's method of approximation to the equation \\( x^2 = N \\), which is equivalent to the use of continued fractions, we may easily establish the following theorem, viz., that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r^2 + N}{2r}, \\quad \\frac{r^3 + 3rN}{3r^2 + N}, \\quad \\frac{r^4 + 6r^2N + N^2}{4r^3 + 4rN}, \\quad \\frac{r^5 + 10r^3N + 5rN^2}{5r^4 + 10r^2N + N^2},\n\\]\n\nwill be successive approximations to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\).\"\n\n2. Their general form is\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(r + \\sqrt{N})^i + (r - \\sqrt{N})^i}{(r + \\sqrt{N})^i - (r - \\sqrt{N})^i} \\sqrt{N},\n\\]\n\nwhich is always rational. In this form the approximation to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) as \\( i \\) increases is obvious. The method of my previous memoir is simply the particular case of \\( i = 2k \\).\n\n3. If we wish to approximate to \\( N^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\), we may take the reciprocal of (1.), or, what is simpler, we may divide (1.) by \\( N \\), thus obtaining\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(r + \\sqrt{N})^i + (r - \\sqrt{N})^i}{(r + \\sqrt{N})^i - (r - \\sqrt{N})^i} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}.\n\\]\n\nBefore we can integrate these formulae, we must reduce them by means of the method of rational fractions; the simplest and most general way is as follows:\n\n4. Let \\( \\varepsilon \\) be an \\( i \\)th root of unity; then, obviously,\n\n\\[\n\\log (1 - x^i) = \\log (1 - \\varepsilon x) + \\log (1 - \\varepsilon^2 x) + \\ldots + \\log (1 - \\varepsilon^{i-1} x).\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the differential coefficient of this by \\(-x\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{i x^i}{1 - x^i} = \\frac{\\varepsilon x}{1 - \\varepsilon x} + \\frac{\\varepsilon^2 x}{1 - \\varepsilon^2 x} + \\frac{\\varepsilon^3 x}{1 - \\varepsilon^3 x} + \\ldots + \\frac{\\varepsilon^i x}{1 - \\varepsilon^i x};\n\\]\n\nand since \\( \\frac{1}{1 - x^i} = 1 + \\frac{x^i}{1 - x^i} \\) and \\( \\frac{1 + x^i}{1 - x^i} = 1 + \\frac{2x^i}{1 - x^i} \\),\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 - x^i} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon x} + \\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon^2 x} + \\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon^3 x} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon^i x};\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + x^i}{1 - x^i} = \\frac{1 + \\varepsilon x}{1 - \\varepsilon x} + \\frac{1 + \\varepsilon^2 x}{1 - \\varepsilon^2 x} + \\frac{1 + \\varepsilon^3 x}{1 - \\varepsilon^3 x} + \\ldots + \\frac{1 + \\varepsilon^i x}{1 - \\varepsilon^i x}.\n\\]\n\nMaking \\( x = \\frac{r - \\sqrt{N}}{r + \\sqrt{N}} \\), we may thus divide \\( N^{\\pm \\frac{1}{2}} \\) into \\( i \\) fractions, each of the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{i} \\left( \\frac{(r + \\sqrt{N}) + \\varepsilon^k (r - \\sqrt{N})}{(r + \\sqrt{N}) - \\varepsilon^k (r - \\sqrt{N})} \\right) N^{\\pm \\frac{1}{2}},\n\\]\n\n\\( k \\) being any integer not exceeding \\( i \\).\n\n5. If we add the pairs \\( k \\) and \\( i - k \\), we obtain for the sum of the pair,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(r + \\sqrt{N})^2 - 2(r - \\sqrt{N})^2}{(r + \\sqrt{N})^2 + (r - \\sqrt{N})^2 - (\\varepsilon^k + \\varepsilon^{i-k})(r^2 - N)} N^{\\pm \\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{8rN}{2(r^2 + N) - (\\varepsilon^k + \\varepsilon^{i-k})(r^2 - N)} \\text{ or same denominator},\n\\]\naccording to whether the upper or lower sign be taken. Now, because \\( \\varepsilon \\) is an \\( i \\)th root of unity, \\( \\varepsilon^k + \\varepsilon^{i-k} = 2 \\cos \\frac{2k\\pi}{i} \\), and the sum of the pair reduces itself, for \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), to\n\n\\[\ny_k = \\frac{1}{i} \\left( \\frac{4rN}{(r^2+N)-\\cos \\frac{2k\\pi}{i}(r^2-N)} - \\frac{2rN}{r^2\\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}+N\\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFor \\( N^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\) we have the simpler forms,\n\n\\[\nz_k = \\frac{1}{i} \\left( \\frac{4r}{(r^2+N)-\\cos \\frac{2k\\pi}{i}(r^2-N)} - \\frac{2r}{r^2\\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}+N\\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nAll that remains is to integrate these terms, and sum them.\n\n6. Our grouping the terms in pairs has limited the value of \\( k \\) to range from \\( i \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2}(i-1) \\) when \\( i \\) is odd. There is an odd term which, however, presents no difficulty, being simply \\( \\frac{r}{i} \\) in the case of \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), and \\( \\frac{r}{iN} \\) in the case of \\( N^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\). When \\( i \\) is even, \\( k \\) is limited to range from 1 to \\( \\frac{1}{2}i-1 \\), and the odd term becomes \\( \\frac{r^2+N}{ir} \\) in the case of \\( \\sqrt{N} \\), and \\( \\frac{r^2+N}{iNr} \\) in the case of \\( N^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\). It is important to bear in mind that the term just mentioned is an odd term, and therefore not affected with the coefficient 2, which appears in the terms composed of pairs corresponding to imaginary roots.\n\n7. The value of \\( i \\), which I consider to be most useful for general purposes, is \\( i=8 \\): in this case the odd term becomes \\( \\frac{r^2+N}{8r} \\) or \\( \\frac{r^2+N}{8Nr} \\), and the other values of \\( \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\) are three in number, viz. 22°30', 45°, 67°30'. With proper precautions \\( i=8 \\) will almost always give seven or more figures correct.\n\n8. If we now give infinite values to \\( k \\) and \\( i \\) and pass from the summation to the definite integral, we have (putting \\( \\lambda=\\frac{k}{i} \\))\n\n\\[\nz=N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi} \\frac{2rd\\lambda}{r^2+(N-r^2)\\cos^2 \\lambda\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi}{1+\\frac{r^2-N}{N}\\sin^2\\phi}\n\\]\n\nand since\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi}{1+p\\cdot\\sin^2\\phi} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi}{\\sqrt{1+p}}\n\\]\n\nthis is an identical equation, as it ought to be.\n\n9. This use of approximants, therefore, is simply the application of the method of\nquadratures to a definite integral, which we substitute for the surd proposed for evaluation.\n\n10. It would appear at first sight that a full application of the method of quadratures in the ordinary way, with the help of differences, would give better results than the mere summation of the ordinates. But this is not the case; for the differences diverge immediately. If we use differential coefficients for the quadrature, instead of differences, we have an opposite anomaly, namely that the correction of the summation appears to be absolutely nil, inasmuch as the differential coefficients which appear in the series are all of odd order, and the numerator of each of them contains the factor $\\sin \\phi \\cos \\phi$, which vanishes at both the limits $0$ and $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi$. Legendre has discussed this point. See the Appendix to the second volume of his 'Fonctions Elliptiques,' p. 578.\n\n11. The application of the method to integrations, then, lies in the substitution for\n\n$$\\int_0^t \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{N}} dt \\text{ of } \\int_0^t \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi} \\frac{2Mr}{r^2 + (N-r^2) \\cos^2 \\lambda \\pi} d\\lambda \\cdot dt,$$\n\nin which, since $\\lambda$ and $t$ are perfectly independent of each other, we may change the order of integration, thus obtaining\n\n$$\\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi} \\left\\{ \\int_0^t \\frac{2Mr}{r^2 + (N-r^2) \\cos^2 \\lambda \\pi} dt \\right\\} d\\lambda ;$$\n\nand the rest of the operation depends upon our being able to perform the integration generally, and then to determine the integral in $\\lambda$ by quadratures. The great advantage of the method turns upon the easy application of the method of quadratures, in consequence of our not requiring to difference the ordinates.\n\n12. One way of exhibiting generally the degree of convergence is as follows: $N^{\\pm \\frac{1}{2}}$ always lies between\n\n$$N^{\\pm \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{(r+\\sqrt{N})^i + (r-\\sqrt{N})^i}{(r+\\sqrt{N})^i - (r-\\sqrt{N})^i} \\text{ and } N^{\\pm \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{(r+\\sqrt{N})^i - (r-\\sqrt{N})^i}{(r+\\sqrt{N})^i + (r-\\sqrt{N})^i},$$\n\nand the error of either is therefore always less than their difference,\n\n$$N^{\\pm \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{4(r^2-N)^i}{(r+\\sqrt{N})^{2i} - (r-\\sqrt{N})^{2i}}.$$\n\n13. There is another mode, by which, in any given case, we may see how far it is necessary to carry our work in order to obtain a given number of decimals correctly in the result. Let $\\theta_m$ be determined by the equation\n\n$$\\int_0^{\\theta_m} \\frac{d\\theta_m}{\\cos \\theta_m} = m \\int_0^{\\theta_1} \\frac{d\\theta_1}{\\cos \\theta_1},$$\n\nand let $\\sin \\theta_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{r}$ or $\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{N}}$, whichever may be less than unity; then the $m$th approximant will be $\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{\\sin \\theta_m}$. This is easily seen from the general term of the approximant, since\n\n$$\\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left( \\frac{1+\\sin \\theta}{1-\\sin \\theta} \\right).$$\n14. A table of meridional parts, such as is given in the books on Navigation, if carried far enough, would solve this equation. I have calculated an auxiliary Table for the purpose, as follows:\n\nLet cosec $\\varphi - 1 = z$, $\\log_t \\tan \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\pi + \\frac{1}{2} \\varphi \\right) = y$, then\n\n$$y = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_t \\frac{2 + z}{z} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\log z + \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} z \\right)$$\n\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\log z + \\frac{z^2}{4} - \\frac{z^3}{16} + \\frac{z^4}{48} - \\frac{z^5}{128} + \\ldots \\ldots .$$\n\nTo bring this formula to the same unit as the common Table of meridional parts, we must multiply it by the number of minutes in the arc equal to unity, or by $L = 3437.74677 \\ 07849 \\ 4$, whence we have $\\frac{1}{2} L \\log_2 2 = 1191.43224 \\ 08243 \\ 2$, and $\\frac{1}{2} L \\log_{10} 10 = 3958.85223 \\ 39129 \\ 100$. These data give the following Table, the argument being the common logarithm of $z$ with its sign changed; that is, the number of places which are correct:\n\n| $-\\log z.$ | $y.$ |\n|-----------|------|\n| 1         | 5234-14859 |\n| 2         | 9117-70966 |\n| 3         | 13068-84816 |\n| 4         | 17026-92712 |\n| 5         | 20985-70200 |\n\n| $-\\log z.$ | $y.$ |\n|-----------|------|\n| 6         | 24944-54650 |\n| 7         | 28903-39796 |\n| 8         | 32862-25012 |\n| 9         | 36821-10235 |\n| 10        | 40779-95458 |\n\n| $-\\log z.$ | $y.$ |\n|-----------|------|\n| 11        | 44738-80681 |\n| 12        | 48697-65905 |\n| 13        | 52656-51128 |\n| 14        | 56615-36352 |\n| 15        | 60574-21575 |\n\n15. As a simple example, let $N = 3$, $r = 2$; $\\therefore \\sqrt{\\frac{N}{r}} = \\sin 60^\\circ$: the meridional parts for $60^\\circ = 4527$; and in order that the error may not exceed unity in the tenth place of figures, we must have $m$ or $i = \\frac{40780}{4527} = 9$; so that we must make $i = 9$ at least, for the 10th figure to be correct.\n\n16. These methods of course only exhibit the degree of approximation on the surd itself. The proportionate approximation is generally greater on the integral than on the simple surd, because the first approximant is usually so chosen as to be identical with the surd at one of the limits, and it is only near the other limit that the discrepancy tells.\n\n**Section II.—Details of Reduction and Computation.**\n\n17. The chief assistance, which can be provided *à priori* for the computer, consists in the exhibition and discussion, for the ordinary forms, of the integral\n\n$$\\int_0^t \\frac{2Mrdt}{r^2 + (N - r^2) \\cos^2 \\lambda \\pi}$$\n\nand of the auxiliary functions which present themselves in its reduction.\n\n18. In applying these methods to elliptic integrals, the radical and the first approximant $r$ must both be of a simple form, and it is advisable that $r^2 - N$ or $N - r^2$ should be\nof a square form. For the common form of the elliptic radical $\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi}$, our choice is practically limited to\n\n(1) $r = 1$,  \n(2) $r = \\cos \\phi$,  \n(3) $r = \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\cos \\phi$,  \n(4) $r = \\cos \\theta$,  \n(5) $r = \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\sin \\phi$.\n\nAnd on these suppositions I now proceed to the integration of the general form of the reduced approximant for $\\int_0^\\infty (1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} d\\phi = \\int z d\\phi$. I omit mention of the constants of integration, because very slight changes in the function may alter them. The first of our three cases require, as they stand, no constant, and these are the most useful cases.\n\n(1) $r = 1$, $r^2 - N = \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi$,\n\n$$z_k = \\frac{2}{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi},$$\n\n$$\\int z_k d\\phi = 2 \\left(1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tan^{-1} \\left(\\left(1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\tan \\phi\\right).$$\n\n(2) $r = \\cos \\phi$, $r^2 - N = -\\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi$,\n\n$$z_k = \\frac{2 \\cos \\phi}{\\cos^2 \\phi + \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi} = \\frac{2 \\cos \\phi}{1 - \\left(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right) \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi},$$\n\n$$\\int z_k d\\phi = \\left(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\log \\left\\{\\frac{1 + \\sin \\phi \\left(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{1 - \\sin \\phi \\left(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right\\}.$$\n\n(3) $r = \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\cos \\phi$, $r^2 - N = -\\cos^2 \\theta$,\n\n$$z_k = \\frac{2 \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\cos \\phi}{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi},$$\n\n$$\\int z_k d\\phi = \\left(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\log \\left\\{\\frac{\\left(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} + \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\sin \\phi}{\\left(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\sin \\phi}\\right\\}.$$\n\n(4) $r = \\cos \\theta$, $r^2 - N = -\\sin^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi$,\n\n$$z_k = \\frac{2}{\\cos \\theta \\cdot \\tan^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\cdot \\cos^2 \\phi},$$\n\n$$\\int z_k d\\phi = 2 \\left(1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tan^{-1} \\left\\{\\cos \\theta \\cdot \\tan \\phi \\left(1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\}.$$\n\n(5) $r = \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\sin \\phi$, $r^2 - N = -\\cos^2 \\phi$,\n\n$$z_k = \\frac{2 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\sin \\phi}{\\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi + \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\cdot \\cos^2 \\phi}.$$\n\\[ \\int z_k d\\varphi = 2 \\left( \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} - \\cos^2 \\theta \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tan^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{\\cos \\varphi} \\left( \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} - \\cos^2 \\theta \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\right\\} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\left( \\cos^2 \\theta - \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\log_i \\left\\{ \\frac{1 - \\cos \\varphi}{1 + \\cos \\varphi} \\left( \\cos^2 \\theta - \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right\\}. \\]\n\n(6) If we make \\( t = \\tan \\frac{1}{2} \\varphi \\), we obtain\n\n\\[ (1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\varphi)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} d\\varphi = 2(1 - 2 \\cos 2 \\theta \\cdot t^2 + t^4)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} dt. \\]\n\nTaking \\( r = 1 - t^2 \\), the terms which we have to integrate are of the form\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{4(1-t^2) dt}{(1-t^2)^2 + 4 \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\cdot t^2}. \\]\n\nPutting \\( q^2 = 1 - \\cos^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\), we have\n\n\\[ \\int z_k d\\varphi = \\frac{1}{q} \\log_i \\left( \\frac{t^2 + 2qt + 1}{t^2 - 2qt + 1} \\right). \\]\n\nThe same expression serves for the integral\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{2dt}{\\sqrt{(1 + 2 \\cos 2 \\theta \\cdot t^2 + t^4)}}, \\]\n\nif we put \\( q^2 = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\).\n\n19. It will be observed that the first four cases, and the sixth, depend upon a radical of the form \\( \\sqrt{(1 - \\sin^2 A \\cdot \\sin^2 \\omega)} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is restricted to the selected values of \\( \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\).\n\nAssuming the modulus \\( \\sin A \\) not to vary, it would therefore in general be better to begin by computing the radical for the selected values. I have computed, and I append to this paper, a Table of this radical, the selected values of \\( \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\) being 22° 30', 45°, and 67° 30', while \\( A \\) ranges by whole degrees from 1° to 90° inclusive. Every entry but the last in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns of the Table was computed by myself in duplicate with Vega's ten-figure logarithms, by the help of two or more of the following formulae, some of which are from Legendre.\n\n20. Putting \\( \\Delta \\) for \\( \\sqrt{(1 - \\sin^2 A \\cdot \\sin^2 \\omega)} \\),\n\n(1) Make \\( \\sin A \\cdot \\sin \\omega = \\sin M \\); then \\( \\Delta = \\cos M \\),\n\n\\[ \\log \\sin M = \\log \\sin A + \\log \\sin \\omega, \\log \\Delta = \\log \\cos M; \\text{ or else} \\]\n\n(2) Make \\( \\tan A \\cdot \\cos \\omega = \\tan M \\); then \\( \\Delta = \\cos A \\cdot \\sec M \\),\n\n\\[ \\log \\tan M = \\log \\tan A + \\log \\cos \\omega, \\log \\Delta = \\log \\cos A + \\ar. co. \\log \\cos M. \\]\n\nMoreover, let \\( L \\) be the tabular angle nearest to the angle \\( M \\): it is not necessary to obtain the value of \\( M \\): so that we have simultaneously,\n\n\\[ \\log \\sin M = \\log \\sin L \\pm s, \\]\n\\[ \\log \\tan M = \\log \\tan L \\pm t, \\]\n\\[ \\log \\cos M = \\log \\cos L \\pm c; \\]\nthen we shall also have, and with great approximation,\n\n\\[\n\\log s = \\log (t \\cdot \\cos^2 L) \\mp (t - t \\cdot \\cos^2 L)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\log (c \\cdot \\cot^2 L) \\mp (c + c \\cdot \\cot^2 L),\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log c = \\log (s \\cdot \\tan^2 L) \\pm (s + s \\cdot \\tan^2 L)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\log (t \\cdot \\sin^2 L) \\pm (t - t \\cdot \\sin^2 L),\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log t = \\log (s \\cdot \\sec^2 L) \\mp (s - s \\cdot \\sec^2 L)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\log (c \\cdot \\cosec^2 L) \\mp (c - c \\cdot \\cosec^2 L).\n\\]\n\nI have given the whole set of six, but my Table was computed with the pair for log \\(c\\). By way of example, I add a specimen copy of one of my working sheets. The use of so many as ten figures is not altogether unnecessary, because otherwise, when \\(\\Delta\\) is nearly equal to unity, the value of \\(\\log (1 - \\Delta)\\) or of \\(\\log \\frac{1 - \\Delta}{1 + \\Delta}\\) cannot be had with exactness.\n\n21. The following formulæ will also be found in many cases preferable, both for exactness and facility, to the ordinary use of logarithmic tables by means of differences. These formulæ, as well as those of the previous paragraph, are but applications of Taylor's theorem, reduced to a shape fit for the computer. Even where only seven figures are required their application is frequently much easier, and gives more exact results, than interpolation by differences. In what follows, \\(x\\) is supposed to be the nearest tabular entry.\n\n22. To find \\(\\log y\\) from \\(\\log \\tan y\\).—Let us assume simultaneously\n\n\\[\n\\log y = \\log x \\pm l, \\quad \\log \\tan y = \\log \\tan x \\pm t.\n\\]\n\nPutting \\(u = \\log x, z = \\log \\tan x\\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d^2u}{dz^2} = M \\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} \\left( \\cos 2x - \\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} \\right),\n\\]\n\n\\(M\\) being the modulus of the logarithms.\n\nHence, by Taylor's theorem,\n\n\\[\nl = t \\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} \\left\\{ 1 \\mp Mt \\left( \\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} - \\cos 2x \\right) \\right\\} \\text{ nearly}.\n\\]\n\nTaking the logarithm, this becomes\n\n\\[\n\\log l = \\log \\left( t \\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} \\right) \\mp t \\left( \\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} - \\cos 2x \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\log \\left( \\frac{t \\cdot \\sin x \\cdot \\cos x}{x} \\right) \\mp t \\cdot \\frac{\\sin x \\cdot \\cos x}{x} \\pm t \\mp 2t \\sin^2 x.\n\\]\n\nThe latter is the better shape for a working formula, because \\(\\log \\sin x\\) and \\(\\log \\cos x\\) are found in the same page and line as \\(\\log \\tan x\\), while \\(\\log \\sin 2x\\) must be looked for elsewhere. The first term alone is sufficient when \\(x\\) is small; but when \\(x\\) much exceeds 45°, \\(\\cos 2x\\) changes its sign, and even the entire formula is insufficient. The maximum value of the coefficient of \\(t\\) in the second term is 1·0631, corresponding to \\(x = 78° 33' 26''\\).\n\nIn many cases, where the first term alone is insufficient, a rough interpolation, made at\nsight from the following Table, will answer the purpose; it is a Table of the value of \\(\\left(\\frac{\\sin 2x}{2x} - \\cos 2x\\right)\\) and of its logarithm, from \\(x = 45^\\circ\\) to \\(x = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n| \\(x\\) | \\(\\log l\\) |\n|------|------------|\n| 45   | 0·63662    |\n| 50   | 0·73816    |\n| 55   | 0·83149    |\n| 60   | 0·91349    |\n| 65   | 0·98041    |\n| 70   | 1·02910    |\n| 75   | 1·05658    |\n| 80   | 1·06216    |\n| 85   | 1·04334    |\n| 90   | 1·          |\n\nThe Table shows that, past 45°, the formula\n\n\\[\n\\log l = \\log \\left(\\frac{t \\sin x \\cos x}{x}\\right) \\mp t\n\\]\n\nis a better approximation than when the \\(\\mp t\\) is omitted. It is to be remarked that \\(t\\) is at its minimum for \\(x = 45^\\circ\\), and increases both towards \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 90^\\circ\\). Near the latter limit, where great accuracy is required, we must proceed as follows.\n\nFind the correction for the logarithm of the complement of the arc by the above process, and then find \\(\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi - y\\right)\\) from \\(\\log y\\). For this purpose, I observe that \\(\\log y = \\log x \\pm l\\) is equivalent to \\(y = x \\cdot 10^{\\pm l}\\), hence\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\pi - y = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi - x \\cdot 10^{\\pm l} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi - x\\right) - x(10^{\\pm l} - 1).\n\\]\n\nNow, let \\(\\pm A = 10^{\\pm l} - 1\\), whence\n\n\\[\n\\log (\\pm mA) = \\log (\\pm l) \\pm \\frac{1}{2} l - \\frac{1}{12} Ml^3 \\text{ nearly, and also}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi - y\\right) = \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi - x\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\pm mA}{\\frac{1}{2} \\pi - x}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} M \\left(\\frac{\\pm mA}{\\frac{1}{2} \\pi - x}\\right)^2 - \\ldots .\n\\]\n\nIt is not often that the third term of either formula will be required.\n\nI have gone into all this detail, because the inverse tangent is continually presenting itself in all these integrations, and because no book that I know shows the proper way of handling it.\n\n23. The following constants are needed for these and similar formulæ:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10 + \\log m &= 9·63778 \\ 43113 \\ 00537, \\\\\n10 + \\log 1' &= 8·24187 \\ 73675 \\ 90828, \\\\\n10 + \\log 1'' &= 6·46372 \\ 61172 \\ 07184, \\\\\n10 + \\log 1''' &= 4·68557 \\ 48668 \\ 23541,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log M &= 0·36221 \\ 56886 \\ 99463, \\\\\n-\\log 1' &= 1·75812 \\ 26324 \\ 09172, \\\\\n-\\log 1'' &= 3·53627 \\ 38827 \\ 92816, \\\\\n-\\log 1''' &= 5·31442 \\ 51331 \\ 76459.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n24.

To find \\( \\log \\frac{y+1}{y-1} \\) from \\( \\log y \\).—Let \\( \\log \\frac{y+1}{y-1} = \\log \\frac{x+1}{x-1} + p \\), and \\( \\log y = \\log x \\pm q \\); then \\( \\log p = \\log \\left( \\frac{2qx}{x^2-1} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}q + \\frac{q}{x^2-1} \\), nearly. This formula obviously fails where \\( y \\) is near unity; in this case \\( \\log \\frac{y+1}{y-1} \\) cannot be had with great accuracy, unless \\( y \\) itself be given absolutely. All the cases of \\( \\int \\frac{dy}{y^2-a^2} \\) may be included in the above formula by giving proper signs to \\( p \\) and \\( q \\). It may save trouble to remark that \\( x \\) must not always be taken to the extreme limit of the Table, because \\( \\log (x+1) \\) and \\( \\log (x-1) \\) have also to be taken out. As an example, let\n\n\\[\n\\log y = 0.36290 63835 \\\\\n\\log x = 0.36285 93030 \\quad x = 2.306, \\quad x+1 = 3.306, \\quad x-1 = 1.306 \\\\\n\\log (x+1) = 0.51930 28492 \\\\\n\\log (x-1) = 0.11594 31769 \\\\\n\\text{sum} = 0.63524 60261 \\\\\n\\text{difference} = 0.40335 96723 \\\\\n\\text{correction} = -5.02761 \\\\\n\\log \\frac{y+1}{y-1} = 0.40330 93962\n\\]\n\n2nd correction = -1225 \\\\\n\\log p = 5.7013619\nThis example has been so chosen as to admit of easy verification. In fact \\( y = 2.30625 \\), and \\( \\log \\frac{y+1}{y-1} = \\log \\frac{529}{209} = 0.40330 \\) nearly. The error is therefore only of three units in the tenth decimal place, where there was no reason to expect accuracy.\n\n26. The only other formulae which I shall give are the following, for finding the logarithm of a number, and vice versa. They are indispensable where more than seven figures are required.\n\nLet \\( \\log (x \\pm h) = \\log x \\pm k \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\log k = \\log \\left( \\frac{mh}{x} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{mh}{x} \\text{ nearly},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\log h = \\log (Mxh) \\pm \\frac{1}{2} k \\text{ nearly}.\n\\]\n\nThe values of \\( \\log m \\) and \\( \\log M \\) have been given in paragraph 23.\n\n27. As an example of the application of the method to the evaluation of elliptic integrals of the third class, let us take the integral\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^\\varphi \\frac{d\\varphi}{(1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cdot \\sin^2 \\varphi)(1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\sin^2 \\varphi)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\\]\n\nfor the values \\( \\alpha = 45^\\circ \\), \\( \\theta = 30^\\circ \\), \\( \\varphi = 60^\\circ \\).\n\nI have selected these values because they can be obtained without reduction or interpolation from the Table of \\( \\Delta(\\theta, \\varphi) \\) which I have given, and also because \\( \\sin^2 \\alpha = \\sin \\theta \\), and therefore the integral can be reduced to one of the first class, plus an inverse tangent, thus admitting of easy verification. For this case\n\n\\[\nz_k = \\frac{2}{(1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cdot \\sin^2 \\varphi)(1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\cdot \\sin^2 \\varphi)^{\\frac{1}{2}}},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\int z_k d\\varphi = \\frac{2 \\sin^2 \\alpha}{\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\cos \\alpha} \\tan^{-1} (\\cos \\alpha \\cdot \\tan \\varphi)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n- \\frac{2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}}{\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i}} \\left( 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tan^{-1} \\left\\{ \\left( 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\cos^2 \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\tan \\varphi \\right\\}.\n\\]\n\nMaking \\( \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\) successively \\( 22^\\circ 30' \\), \\( 45^\\circ \\), \\( 67^\\circ 30' \\), and, for the odd term, \\( 90^\\circ \\), we find, after a few obvious reductions, that eight times the value of the integral is\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{ \\frac{17}{3} + \\frac{2}{\\Delta^2(45^\\circ, 67\\frac{1}{2})} + \\frac{2}{\\Delta^2(45^\\circ, 22\\frac{1}{2})} \\right\\} \\frac{1}{\\cos 45^\\circ} \\tan^{-1} \\{ \\cos 45^\\circ \\cdot \\tan 60^\\circ \\}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n- \\frac{1}{\\cos 30^\\circ} \\tan^{-1} \\{ \\cos 30^\\circ \\cdot \\tan 60^\\circ \\} - \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{1}{\\Delta(30^\\circ, 45^\\circ)} \\tan^{-1} \\{ \\Delta(30^\\circ, 45^\\circ) \\cdot \\tan 60^\\circ \\}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n- \\tan^{-1} \\{ \\Delta(30^\\circ, 67\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\tan 60^\\circ \\} \\cdot \\cos^2 22\\frac{1}{2} \\tan^{-1} \\{ \\Delta(30^\\circ, 22\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\tan 60^\\circ \\} \\cdot \\cos^2 67\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta^2(45^\\circ, 67\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\Delta(30^\\circ, 67\\frac{1}{2})\n\\]\nAs these inverse tangents range generally from $45^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$, I computed them by the shortened formula of paragraph 22, namely $\\log \\left( \\frac{t \\cdot \\sin x \\cdot \\cos x}{x} \\right) \\pm t$; this being sufficient to give eight figures of decimals accurately. I found\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log \\tan^{-1}\\{\\cos 45^\\circ \\tan 60^\\circ\\} &= 9.94747 \\ 15296, \\\\\n\\log \\tan^{-1}\\{\\cos 30^\\circ \\tan 60^\\circ\\} &= 9.99246 \\ 23739, \\\\\n\\log \\tan^{-1}\\{\\Delta(30^\\circ, 45^\\circ) \\tan 60^\\circ\\} &= 0.00766 \\ 92607, \\\\\n\\log \\tan^{-1}\\{\\Delta(30^\\circ, 67\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\tan 60^\\circ\\} &= 9.99727 \\ 33807, \\\\\n\\log \\tan^{-1}\\{\\Delta(30^\\circ, 22\\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot \\tan 60^\\circ\\} &= 0.01665 \\ 09657.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nI hence obtained the following values:\n\n| For the positive terms. | For the negative terms. |\n|------------------------|------------------------|\n| 7.10991 3039           | 1.13483 2441           |\n| 4.37212 6152           | 0.72539 4027           |\n| 2.70421 6251           | 1.66839 9478           |\n| 14.17725 5442          | 0.16728 4032           |\n| 3.69590 9978           | 3.69590 9978           |\n| 8)10.48134 5464        |                        |\n| 1.31016 8183 value required |\n\nA more exact value of the integral, otherwise obtained, is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} F(30^\\circ, 60^\\circ) + \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4 \\sin 60^\\circ}{\\sqrt{13}}\\right) = 1.31016 \\ 8161,\n\\]\n\nwhich differs from the previous value by 2 units in the eighth decimal place.\n\n28. In order to find how many places ought to have been accurately obtained, I observe that the method followed gives $N = \\frac{13}{16}$; $r = 1$, whence\n\n\\[\n\\log \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{N} \\right) = 9.95491 = \\log \\sin 64^\\circ 20' 30''.\n\\]\n\nThe corresponding meridional parts are 5086.5, which must be multiplied by $i = 8$, giving 40692.0. Referring to the Table in paragraph 14, I find that this nearly corresponds to ten places correct, and therefore that the integral ought to be correct to at least that extent. That it is not so, is due to my having curtailed the formula for finding the logarithms of the inverse tangents. But my object was only to give seven decimals correct, and my going beyond that was simply because, with a ten-figure Table, putting down the additional figures gave me less trouble (once I had to use more than seven) than abbreviation would have done. This remark may at first sight seem strange to any one who has not had some practice in using large Tables. But the logarithmic corrections are given in the shape of arithmetical complements: with reference\nto the 10th figure, therefore, considered as an integer, the index is right as it stands, and we need not bestow thought on the proper placing of the correction, as we must if we use any other number of figures.\n\n29. If we had been content with five decimals, the calculation would have been very easy, for in that case we might have used six-figure logarithms, and have made \\( i = 4 \\), thus omitting the terms containing \\( 22^\\circ \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( 67^\\circ \\frac{1}{2} \\).

It is worth while to notice a case which will sometimes occur, namely (using the notation of the last example), that the values may be so selected as to give, for one of the values of \\( k \\), \\( \\sin \\alpha = \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\cos \\frac{k\\pi}{i} \\), and thus each of the terms into which \\( \\int z_k d\\phi \\) was divided would become infinite. Of course the difficulty is only apparent; for in this case the proper value is \\( \\int z_k d\\phi = \\int \\frac{2d\\phi}{(1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi)^2} \\), of which the integral may be at once found by differentiating the expression \\( \\frac{\\sin \\phi \\cdot \\cos \\phi}{1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi} \\).\n\nSection III.—Extension of the Method.\n\nIn respect of rapid approximation and precision of limit, the foregoing processes leave nothing to be desired, as far as concerns the radical of the square root; but they do not go beyond that. Mr. Sylvester has given an elegant extension of the method to radicals of a higher index, by means of symmetric functions*.\n\nThe more general problem before us is that of approximating to the integrals of irrational functions by means of rational substitutions.\n\nLet \\( \\varphi \\) and \\( \\psi \\) be functional symbols, and \\( y \\) a function of \\( z \\); then, that \\( \\varphi(z) \\cdot y_m \\) and \\( \\varphi(z) : y_m \\) should both be approximations to \\( \\varphi(z) \\), depends upon \\( y_m \\) approaching unity as \\( m \\) increases. Assuming that \\( y_m \\) and \\( y_1 \\) are connected by the equation \\( y_m = \\psi(m, y_1) \\), our problem is to choose \\( \\psi \\) so that, in the first place, the approximation shall be exceedingly rapid, and, in the next place, that \\( \\varphi(z) \\cdot y_m \\) and \\( \\varphi(z) : y_m \\) shall both (or at least one of them) be thoroughly manageable, and easily integrable. In the case of the approximants already given, the equation \\( y_m = \\psi(m, y_1) \\) has been made \\( \\int \\frac{dy_m}{1 - y_m^2} = m \\int \\frac{dy_1}{1 - y_1^2} \\).\n\nI am acquainted with three general methods which effect the object more or less. The first is the obvious one afforded by the Newtonian approximation to the roots of an equation; viz., let \\( a \\) be a first approximate solution, obtained by trial, of the equation \\( f'x = 0 \\), and call \\( f'x \\) the differential coefficient of \\( f'x \\); then a second approximation is\n\n* See the Philosophical Magazine for December 1860, Supplementary Number, vol. xx. p. 525, note A.\n\\(a - \\frac{fu}{f'a} = b\\); a third approximation will evidently be \\(b - \\frac{fb}{f'b} = c\\), and so forth. If we apply this method to the pure equation \\(x^n = p\\), the convergent terms which we obtain are as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= \\frac{(n-1)a^n + p}{na^{n-1}}, \\\\\nc &= \\frac{(n-1)\\left\\{\\frac{(n-1)a^n + p}{na^{n-1}}\\right\\}^n + n^n.p.a^{n(n-1)}}{n^2a^{n-1}\\left\\{\\frac{(n-1)a^n + p}{na^{n-1}}\\right\\}^{n-1}}, &c.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe second method is that of the reversion of series; it is sufficiently discussed by Arbogast*.\n\nThe third method was suggested to me by Mr. Cayley's remark that Mr. Sylvester's third approximation is a particular case, for \\(n=2\\), of the common form (of the books on the binomial theorem) \\(\\sqrt[n]{N} = \\frac{(n+1)N + (n-1)a^n}{(n-1)N + (n+1)a^n} \\cdot a\\), approximately, \\(a\\) being a first approximation. In order to gain generality, and thereby symmetry, I shall pass from the particular form \\(\\sqrt[n]{N}\\) to the more general \\(\\varphi^{-1}N\\) by the following Lemma:\n\nLet\n\n\\[\nN = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \n\\]  \n\nand let \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\ldots\\) be determined by the system of equations,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nN &= a_0\\left(1 + \\frac{a_1}{a_0}x_1\\right) \\\\\n&= a_0\\left(1 + \\frac{a_1}{a_0}x_2\\left(1 + \\frac{a_2}{a_1}x_1\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&= a_0\\left(1 + \\frac{a_1}{a_0}x_3\\left(1 + \\frac{a_2}{a_1}x_2\\left(1 + \\frac{a_3}{a_2}x_1\\right)\\right)\\right), \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand so forth; also let \\(N-a_0=\\mu\\), and\n\n\\[\n1 = (\\mu-a_1x-a_2x^2-a_3x^3-\\ldots)(\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1x+\\lambda_2x^2+\\lambda_3x^3+\\ldots),\n\\]\n\nthen\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_1}, x_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2}, x_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_3}, \\ldots x_n = \\frac{\\lambda_{n-1}}{\\lambda_n}.\n\\]\n\nFor, if we substitute these values in the equations (2.) after placing them in the following form,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mu &= N - a_0 = a_1x_1 \\\\\n&= a_1x_2 + a_2x_2x_1 \\\\\n&= a_1x_3 + a_2x_3x_2 + a_3x_3x_2x_1,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand so forth, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{a_1\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{a_1\\lambda_1 + a_2\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_2} = \\frac{a_1\\lambda_2 + a_2\\lambda_1 + a_3\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_3} = &c., \n\\]\n\nwhich are the same equations as we should get by multiplying the two series in (3.) and equating to zero the coefficients of \\(x\\) and of its powers. The coefficient \\(\\lambda_0 = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\), obviously.\n\n* Calcul des Dérivations, pp. 288–296.\nThe coefficients $\\lambda$ may now be found in a variety of ways; by solving equations (4.) or (5.), by simple division, or by Arbogast's processes*. The object of the preceding lemma is to connect the quantities $x_n$ with the coefficients of division and of recurring series. Our results in any way are,\n\n$$x_1 = \\frac{\\mu}{a_1}, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{a_1\\mu}{a_2\\mu + a_1^3},$$\n\n$$x_3 = \\frac{a_2\\mu^2 + a_1^3\\mu}{a_3\\mu^2 + 2a_2a_1\\mu + a_1^3},$$\n\n$$x_4 = \\frac{a_3\\mu^3 + 2a_2a_1\\mu^2 + a_1^3\\mu}{a_4\\mu^3 + (2a_3a_1 + a_2^2)\\mu^2 + 3a_2a_1^2\\mu + a_1^4}.$$\n\nIf for $a_0$, $a_1$, &c. we substitute the coefficients of the binomial theorem, so as to make $N=(a+x)^n$, we obtain\n\n$$a+x_1 = \\frac{(n-1)a^n+N}{na^n} \\cdot a,$$\n\n$$a+x_2 = \\frac{(n-1)a^n+(n+1)N}{(n+1)a^n+(n-1)N} \\cdot a,$$\n\n$$a+x_3 = \\frac{(n^2-1)a^{2n}+(4n^2+2)a^nN+(n^2-1)N^2}{(n+1)(n+2)a^{2n}+4(n^2-1)a^nN+(n-1)(n-2)N^2} \\cdot a.$$\n\nMaking $n=2$, we obtain Mr. Sylvester's approximants to the square root, and $\\lambda_n$ is then the coefficient of $x^n$ in the development by ascending powers of\n\n$$\\frac{1}{(N-a^2)-2ax-x^2};$$\n\nand so far the method agrees with the Newtonian approximation by continued fractions; but from this point the two methods diverge. For $n=3$, $\\lambda_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the development of\n\n$$\\frac{1}{(N-a^3)-3a^2x-3ax^2-x^3};$$\n\nand the successive approximants are\n\n$$\\frac{2a^3+N}{3a^3} \\cdot a, \\quad \\frac{a^3+2N}{2a^3+N} \\cdot a, \\quad \\frac{4a^6+19a^3N+4N^2}{10a^6+16a^3N+N^2} \\cdot a, \\quad \\frac{5a^9+45a^6N+30a^3N^2+N^3}{15a^9+51a^6N+15a^3N^2} \\cdot a, \\text{ &c.};$$\n\nwhile the second approximant obtained by successive substitution is\n\n$$\\frac{16a^9+51a^6N+12a^3N^2+2N^3}{36a^9+36a^6N+9a^3N^2} \\cdot a.$$\n\nWhat these methods all effect is simply a rational approximation to the value of $y$ in the equation $\\varphi(y,z)=0$. Then, making $y=\\frac{du}{dz}$, we have only to integrate in order to find the value of $u$. They thus constitute a means of approximately solving, in respect of $u$, differential equations of the form $\\varphi(z,\\frac{du}{dz})=0$; but they do not effect the solu-\n\n* See his 'Calcul des Dérivations,' pp. 26, 29; or De Morgan, 'Diff. Calc.' p. 331.\ntion of this equation in respect of $z$, and still less do they solve the more general form\n\n$$\\varphi(u, z, \\frac{du}{dz}) = 0.$$  \n\nIt may suggest processes of reduction in some cases to remark, that there are many other functions of $y_m$ and $\\varphi(z)$, which will approximate to $\\varphi(z)$ as $m$ increases, besides the simple product or quotient of $\\varphi(z)$ by $y_m$.\n\nThere is one point about these higher approximants, of which a solution, even if accompanied with considerable restrictions, would be extremely desirable,—I mean the resolution of the denominators into factors. I do not suppose that the problem, in its perfectly general form, admits of a compact solution; but any class of cases, of even moderate generality, for which it could be elegantly solved, would probably have very useful applications. The criterion of convergence and the measure of approximation would also have their interest.\n### Specimen sheet of work for the Table.\n\n| Arc of 60°. | Logarithms |\n|-------------|------------|\n| **Log sin** $22\\frac{1}{2}$ = 9·58283 96605 83* | **Log tan² L** = 9·0913166 |\n| **Log sin A** = 9·93753 06316 96 | **Log s** = 5·3160144 |\n| **Log sin M** = 9·52037 02922 79 | **Log c** = 4·4073310 |\n| **Log sin L** = 9·52039 09944 | **Log tan² L** = } -233 |\n| **s** = -2 07021 | **s tan² L** = } -233 |\n| **s tan² L** = 25546 | **Log c** = 4·4073077 |\n\n| Log sin 45° = 9·84948 50021 68* | Log tan² L = 9·7781471 |\n| Log sin A = 9·93753 06316 96 | Log s = 4·1137763 |\n| Log sin M = 9·78701 56338 64 | Log c = 3·8919234 |\n| Log sin L = 9·78701 43344 | Log tan² L = } + 21 |\n| **s** = + 12995 | **s tan² L** = } + 21 |\n| **s tan² L** = 7821 | **Log c** = 3·8919255 |\n\n| Log sin 67\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) = 9·96561 53459 21* | Log tan² L = 10·2501550 |\n| Log sin A = 9·93753 06316 96 | Log s = 4·7816118 |\n| Log sin M = 9·90314 59776 17 | Log c = 5·0317668 |\n| Log sin L = 9·90313 99296 | Log tan² L = } + 168 |\n| **s** = + 60480 | **s tan² L** = } + 168 |\n| **s tan² L** = 1 07589 | **Log c** = 5·0317836 |\n\n| Log tan 22\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) = 9·61722 43146 62* | Log sin² L = 8·6140815 |\n| Log cos A = 9·69897 00043 36 | Log t = 5·5451559 |\n| Log tan M = 9·31619 43190 08 | Log sec L = 0·00911 84784 |\n| Log tan L = 9·31615 92213 | Log tan² L = } + 327 |\n| **t** = + 3 50877 | **t sin² L** = } + 327 |\n| **t sin² L** = 14018 | **Log c** = 4·1591701 |\n\n| Log tan 45 = 10·00000 00000 00* | Log sin² L = 9·3009948 |\n| Log cos A = | Log t = 5·3429218 |\n| Log tan M = 9·69897 00043 36 | Log sec L = 0·04845 06017 |\n| Log tan L = 9·69894 79790 | Log tan² L = } + 176 |\n| **t** = + 2 20253 | **t sin² L** = } + 176 |\n| **t sin² L** = 44047 | **Log c** = 4·6439342 |\n\n| Log tan 67\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) = 10·38277 56853 38* | Log sin² L = 9·7730722 |\n| Log cos A = 9·69897 00043 36 | Log t = 4·7719327 |\n| Log tan M = 10·08174 56896 74 | Log sec L = 0·19521 55228 |\n| Log tan L = 10·08175 16044 | Log tan² L = } - 24 |\n| **t** = - 59147 | **t sin² L** = } - 24 |\n| **t sin² L** = 35075 | **Log c** = 4·5450025 |\n\n**Note.**—The entries marked *, and the whole of the letter-press, were printed on the sheets.
