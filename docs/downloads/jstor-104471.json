All the Parts of the Foetus were found in\nher Stools, except the Head; which is supposed to\nhave come away by the Vagina, when she had the\nSymptoms of Miscarrying above mentioned; for it\nwas now recollected, that she then said, Something\ncame away with her Water as big as a large Nut,\nbut it was not then attended to.

Lic. Coll. Med. Londin. to Crom-\nwell Mortimer, M. D. Secr. R. S. con-\ncerning an extraordinary Cystis in the\nLiver, full of Water.\n\nSIR,\n\nRead March 14. I HOPE you will excuse the Liberty\nI take in communicating to you an un-\ncommon Cate or Disorder of the Liver, lately observed\nat the opening the Body of Mrs. A. B. deceased,\naged near Forty, whom I had attended some Weeks before. The Complaint was a constant acute Pain on the Region of the Liver, with a Swelling, or more than ordinary Fullness on that Side; by pressing of which was perceived a Fluctuation of some Fluid lying deeper than just under the first Teguments. This was confirmed by Mr. Sherwood, the Surgeon who assisted and examined the same. The Body was opened by his Son Mr. Sherwood junior, when the Liver was found of a prodigious Size (there was a small Adhesion to the Peritoneum without Inflammation): It spread over the Stomach quite to the Spleen on the left Side, and contracted much the Cavity of the Thorax, by pressing and thrusting up the Diaphragma. On opening the great Lobe of the Liver, there issued out above four Quarts of a limpid Water, from a Cavity formed by the proper containing Coat of the Liver; tho' the Water itself had been contained in a single conglomerated Gland, and there formed a Cystis, which had burst, and was found loose at the Bottom of this large Cavity. This Skin or Cystis was not so thin but still capable of further Expansion.\n\nThe Liver still did its Function of separating the Gall: The Gall-bladder and its Ducts were in a good State: The Lobulus Spigelii was much inlarg'd, and crumbled easily like a Mass of congealed Blood.\n\nThe Patient had no particular Thirst; nor was there any Alteration in the Urine, as to Quantity more or less. But she had this Symptom, common in the Hydrops Pectoris, of not bearing any other Posture\nPosture but that of leaning forwards on her Breast. I am, with all Respect,\n\nSIR,\n\nMarch 10. 1744. Your most obedient\n\nHumble Servant,\n\nCh. Jernegan.\n\nThe left Kidney, being longer than usual, was examined and found to have two Ureters; and each had its separate Pelvis.\n\nXVIII.
