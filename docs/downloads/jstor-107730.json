Also a description of a Five-feet Equatorial Instrument employed in the observations. By John Frederick William Herschel, Esq. F. R. S. and James South, Esq. F. R. S.\n\nRead January 15, 1824.\n\nThe frequent and exact determination of the apparent distances and positions of such double stars, as are sufficiently close to be easily measured with micrometers and high magnifying powers, was suggested by Sir William Herschel, more than forty years ago, as an enquiry likely to lead to interesting results, and which has, in fact, in his hands, led to the creation of a new department of physical astronomy, and to the discovery of a class of phænomena in the sidereal heavens referable to the agency of attractive forces, and analogous to those produced by gravity within the limits of our own system. The immediate object with which the enquiry was commenced, the determination of the existence and amount of annual parallax, was soon lost sight of in the more extensive views of the construction of the universe which unfolded themselves as it advanced, and has not since been resumed; though, from the extreme precision of which it will appear in the course of this paper such measurements are susceptible, owing to the refinements of modern instrument-making (a precision not to be looked for in any other class\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent of celestial observations) and the progress we may yet hope for from farther improvements in this respect, there is every reason to suppose it still the most eligible mode of setting at rest that great question, and to believe that no distant period must put us in possession of something decisive from this quarter, as to the existence or non-existence of an appreciable amount of that element.\n\nMeanwhile unexpected phenomena have been witnessed. The existence of binary systems, in which two stars perform to each other the offices of sun and planet, has been distinctly proved, and the periods of rotation of more than one such pair ascertained with something approaching to exactness. The immersions and emersions of stars behind each other have been noted, and real motions among them detected, rapid enough to become sensible and measureable in very short intervals of time.\n\nThe results of Sir William Herschel's observations from 1779 to 1784, were published in two Catalogues in the Philosophical Transactions for 1782 and 1785, and consist of descriptions and measures of 702 double and triple stars. The labour of re-examination was undertaken and executed by him in 1801, 2, 3 and 4, after a lapse of twenty years; and the changes observed or suspected in them were recorded in two other papers, published in the volumes for 1802 and 1804. It was to be naturally expected that, owing to the imperfection of the micrometers with which many of the earlier measures, especially those of 1779 and 1780, were performed, and the novelty of the subject, many errors would have crept in; and that a verification of the facts, by farther observation, would at all events be highly desirable. Accordingly, in the\nyear 1816, a second re-examination of the measures was entered on by his Son (one of the authors of this paper), and some progress made in it; several of the results of which will be found attached to the measures in the following pages. The instruments in Mr. South's possession being peculiarly adapted to the purpose, a similar idea had also occurred to him; and, at his suggestion, it was determined to undertake the work of re-examination in concert, which was accordingly commenced in March, 1821, and continued, whenever weather and circumstances would permit, till the present time.\n\nMeanwhile (though at that time unknown to us), a similar undertaking had been commenced and carried to a considerable extent by a very exact and assiduous continental astronomer, Mr. Struve, Director of the Imperial Observatory of Dorpat. The comparison of his observations of such of our stars as have been measured by him with our own, will not be found the least interesting part of the present paper. So far as it goes, the coincidences of our results, with very few exceptions, are striking; and afford the most satisfactory ground for reliance on the methods employed by both.\n\nProfessor Amici, of Modena, has also of late occupied himself in the pursuit of the same object, with instruments said to be of extraordinary power. Very few, however, of his results have come to our knowledge, and those imperfectly stated; hence it may fairly be presumed that the differences existing between them and our own, will be found to admit of easy explanation.\n\nThe instruments employed in our combined observations, are two capital achromatic telescopes mounted equatorially, of the respective focal lengths of five and seven feet. These\nare cited in the following pages by the names of the five-feet and the seven-feet equatorials; and a brief account of them, especially of the former, will neither be uninteresting to the practical astronomer, nor irrelevant to the objects of this communication.\n\n**Five-feet Equatorial.**\n\nThe greatest part of this instrument, with regard to bulk, is constructed of tinned iron plate. Its characteristic qualities are great lightness, extreme steadiness, promptness in answering to its adjustments, and capability of retaining them.\n\nThe instrument, as represented in fig. 1, Plate I, is drawn on a scale of one-twelfth of the real dimensions. The view is taken at right angles to the plane of the declination circle. The polar axis is about ten feet and a half long. The lower end is a pivot attached to a cone, which, reckoning upwards, is about one-fourth of the whole length, the sides of this cone making with each other an angle of about fifty degrees. The higher side of the cone, for about a foot of its length, is cut in a sloping direction, as seen in the figure, for the purpose of more conveniently observing in the vicinity of the pole. From the upper end of the cone, the polar axis branches into two parts, between which is room for the declination circle and the head of the observer: these two branches are again united at the top by an open frame of bell-metal, represented in fig. 2, to which the upper pivot is attached; which frame, as well as the iron work which supports it, is so contrived, as to present the least possible surface to obstruct the telescope. For the same reason, the pivot at the top of the axis is made as small as possible, while that at the lower end is considerably larger. Both ends of\nthe axis are supported on stones; the northern one rising within about four inches of the level of the axis of the declination circle; the rest of the support being of wrought iron. At the southern end the stone rises very little above the floor, but a cast iron frame supports the pivot at the height of about two feet. The Y, or angle which receives the lower pivot, is placed upon the frame, and provided with two screw adjustments, one for giving the axis its due elevation, and the other for bringing the instrument to the meridian. The form of the iron-work above-mentioned will be sufficiently comprehended on consulting the different figures of the Plates.\n\nThe two branches of the polar axis, on their upper sides, are formed of broad planes, both making one continued plane. On these surfaces the axis and reading microscopes of the declination circle are fixed. The plane is as much above the line of centre as was judged would render the instrument self-balanced; but the declination circle, &c. having proved somewhat lighter than was expected, an equilibrium is effected by a weight fixed to the conical part of the polar axis. The diameter of the declination circle is four feet, the length of the telescope five feet, and the axis about thirty-two inches long. In Plate I, fig. 1, the declination circle appears quite plane, exhibiting the form of a drum-head, with the telescope looking towards the equator, and projecting at each end a little beyond the circle. In Plate II, the draughtsman stood close to the south pole of the instrument, on account of which, and its elevation, the polar axis is considerably foreshortened. In this figure the edge of the declination circle is shown as a short cylinder, the object-end of the telescope protruding beyond it. In this figure is also seen the shape of the\ndeclination axis, and the two principal reading microscopes, viz. those which give declinations. There is a third microscope, which indicates zenith distances. This is seen in Plate I. fig. 1, between the eye end of the telescope and the instrument's elevated pole. In the latter figure is shown, on the extreme border of the drum, a narrow brass ring, whereon the graduation is made. This ring is not only narrow, but as thin as was judged consistent with sound workmanship; this slightness is necessary, because iron plate and brass expand very differently, but the former being much stronger, the latter must obey it: the brass is soldered to the iron, and also pinned to it at short intervals.\n\nThe hour circle, two feet in diameter, is fastened to the lower end of the polar axis, the edge of which is seen in Plate I. fig. 1, its under side in Plate II., and its face in Plate III. fig. 5. One of the reading microscopes is well seen in Plate I. fig. 1, and both of them, less perfectly in the other two figures. The whole of this circle was of brass, and the divisions were at first made upon that metal; but twenty-two years exposure to the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of London had obliterated the graduation. This has been restored by Mr. Trough- ton, upon an inlaid ring of platina, the divisions (fine lines) corresponding to twenty seconds each, which are subdivided by the microscopes to tenths of seconds. The declination circle is divided to five minutes, which are subdivided by the micrometer screw of the microscopes to single seconds, with a capability of estimating further subdivisions. The instrument is furnished with two good ground levels, neither of which are seen in any of the figures. The divided side of the declination circle has been called a drum; but the reverse is articulated;\nshowing how the conical parts of the axis and telescope are united, as well as the radial bars which proceed from the axis and telescope almost to the border of the circle, and how these bars, thin as the tinned plate is, are rendered firm and inflexible. It is on this side that the levels would be seen; one of them is parallel to the telescope, the other to the declination axis. In fig. 1, is seen the support of one end of the latter, above the polar axis, and nearly half way between the centre of the circle and its limb; here a circular aperture in the drum is represented as being quadrisectioned by a cross. This has, inserted in its centre, a small pivot or cylinder pointed inwards, upon which one end of the level is supported, while, on the articulated side, a cross and similar pivot support the opposite end. Both of the pivots are adjustable by screws, and the adjustment being duly performed by them, the horizontality of the axis is ascertained in every position of the telescope, when directed to the meridian. The other level, which is the larger, hangs upon similar adjustable pivots, which adjustment being performed, places the level parallel to the line of collimation of the telescope, serving at all times to ascertain the due elevation of the polar axis, as well as to answer many other useful purposes.\n\nThe clamps and screws for slow motion deserve notice; the former from being unusual, and both from being good. Instead of the common mode of clamping upon the circle, in this instrument the clamp is made to grasp the axis. There is soldered on each axis a ring of brass, the outer edge of which is broad and cylindrical. On this fixed ring a movable one is well fitted, and afterwards cut into three equal parts. These are again united at two places by joints, like\nthose which bind the different parts of a watch-chain together. At the third juncture the clamping takes place; a projecting part of the ring having been left where the third section is made, and a strong screw at right angles to this section, which is made to gape, brings the parts towards each other, and effects a firm embrace. The clamping apparatus, so far described, was avowedly borrowed from the means used for fixing the shaft of an ordinary wind-mill. To the middle of each of the trisected rings are fastened long arms of tinned iron plate, at the extremities of which the slow moving screws have their places. The fixed stud is in the lower screw planted in the iron support; that of the upper one in the polar axis; the moveable studs are of course connected with the levers.\n\nThe long screw for slow motion in right ascension is acted on by a contrate wheel and a pinion at right angles to the plane of the circle; a long handle attached to it is shown in Plate I, fig. 1, leaning against the northern pier. A similar screw for declination, but without the contrate part, is seen in Plate II, fig. 3. All the apparatus for clamping and slow motion is seen in Plates I, II, and III, figures 1, 3, and 5.\n\nIt may be remarked, that in the apparatus described, the right-ascension motion does not at all disturb that in declination; nor does that of declination affect the other: properties most essential to facilitate and render accurate, micrometrical observations; properties not to be expected, with the same precision, from those contrivances to which micrometers are usually attached, known by the name of equatorial stands.\n\nThe illumination of the wires of the telescope is produced by a small lantern, which has its place at one end of the\nEye piece half the real size.\n\nFig 4.\n\nPlan of the Iron Frame, Hour Circle &c.\n\nTho Bradley del.\nJa Basire sculp.\nFig. 2: Bootis and the neighbouring Stars.\n\nFig. 4: The apparent relative orbit of the two Stars of Bootis.\n\nFig. 3: 61 Cygni and the neighbouring Stars.\n\nFig. 4: Showing the different relative positions of the two Stars 61 Cygni and its companion at different times and according to different observers.\n\nS. the Large Star\n\n1.

There is a neat contrivance placed between the nose of the lantern and end of the axis, by which the quantity of light is regulated, so as to suit the nature of any observation that may be made; and such is the amplitude of this illumination, that, on one hand, the brightness of broad day is produced, and on the other, total darkness. In any position of the telescope, and while the object is viewed, the adjustment of light can be conveniently effected, by means of a long handle shown in Plate I. fig. 1, hanging down on the hither side of the polar axis.\n\nIn Plate III. fig. 4, the eye-piece of the telescope is represented, in which there is seen the edge of a graduated circle, the front of a quadrant, and two small spirit levels. This apparatus is particularly described by Sir G. Shuckburgh, in the Phil. Trans. 1793; by which, and by some small tables given in his paper on the Equatorial, the corrections due to refraction and parallax are neatly allowed for, in observations made at a distance from the meridian. There is also seen in this figure, rather partially represented, a double parallel line micrometer (sometimes called a repeating micrometer), which also measures angles of position. Although this apparatus has had not a little to do with the observations recorded in this paper, it is forborne to give a detailed account of it: 1st., because it would considerably lengthen this description, which, it is feared, many will think too long already; 2dly, because a great number of these micrometers are in the possession of practical astronomers, and of course their construction is tolerably well known; and, lastly, because they have been described in our modern Encyclopaedias.*\n\n* Rees's Encyclopædia, Article Micrometer. Brewster's ditto, ditto.\n\nMDCCCXXIV. C\nthought however, that the micrometer under consideration, was the first that had a position circle large enough to show distinctly minutes of a degree, by help of its verniers. This equatorial was designed to suit its first situation, viz. on the top of a house, where, to the north, higher buildings prevented any distant objects from being seen, and to the south, a smoky town presented almost as great an obstruction. The instrument being elevated 50 feet above solid ground, it became absolutely necessary that a permanent mark should from time to time be consulted. This advantage only presented itself to the westward, where, at a proper distance, the ground was not much below the level of the instrument; and to suit it to these circumstances, the declination axis was converted into a telescope. The effect produced by this, is similar to that of the Y level of the civil engineers, but with this difference: it is here required that each end of the axis should alternately be presented to the object, and that in reversed positions the telescope should have equal power. For these purposes, both ends have crossed wires, adjustable so as to be placed in the centres of their respective pivots. Exterior to the wires are placed object glasses of equal focal lengths, and an eye-glass, removable from one end to the other, completes the apparatus. The whole instrument having been adjusted astronomically, it was easy to build up a mark to the level of the axis, and also at right angles to the meridian, which afterwards became a substitute for a meridian mark, and also afforded an excellent mean for adjusting the reading microscopes of the hour circle.\n\nThe instrument bears no maker's name. The whole\nscheme of its fabric was cast by the late Captain Huddart, many years a worthy Fellow of this Society. All the tinned iron work was made, under the direction and inspection of the same able engineer. Under the like superintendence also, was the brass work made, by J. and E. Troughton; who having furnished it with graduation, reading microscopes, levels, &c. completed the instrument in 1797. The excellent object-glass for the telescope of $3\\frac{3}{4}$ inches aperture was made by the late P. and J. Dollond. The power ordinarily employed is 133; besides which, powers of 68, 116, 240, 303, and 381, were occasionally used, being double eye-pieces; and in some few cases a single lens with a power of 578 was employed for the purpose of minute scrutiny. The extent of the field with these powers (in their order beginning with the lowest, 68) was respectively $34'$, $31'$, $20'$, $19'$, $13'$, $11'$, and . . . . . .\n\nTo preserve the tinned iron plate from oxidation, it has been well covered with white paint, and afterwards varnished; thus it has not only a neat appearance, but can be cleaned at any time, without difficulty.\n\nThe present situation of this instrument, in the immediate vicinity of one of the great thoroughfares of this immense metropolis, required the adoption of particular precautions against tremors. The northern pier is therefore sunk seven feet into the earth, where it is bedded on a Yorkshire flag four feet square, and two feet in thickness, into which the pier is firmly tenoned and fastened by stone wedges. From this flag rises a mass of brickwork to the level of the surface, surrounding the pier, and united with Parker's cement, having the area of its horizontal section equal to that of the\nThe weight of this effectually secures the stability of the foundation stone. The southern pier likewise consists of a large stone, two feet in thickness, resting on a bed of brickwork, carried downwards ten feet below the surface. So effectual are these precautions, that stars pass with perfect regularity along the whole extent of the declination wire, while the heaviest waggons are traversing the street within forty feet of the instrument, which, in one instance, has kept its adjustments, and been actually employed as a transit for six weeks, without sensible alteration. Indeed, whilst in Captain Huddart's possession, it was almost exclusively used as a meridian instrument.\n\nThe object glass of the seven feet equatorial is the work of Mr. Tulley, and may perhaps be regarded at present as the chef d'œuvre of that eminent artist. It is five inches in clear aperture, and in distinctness under high magnifying powers* is probably excelled by no refractor existing. Proof of this will be found in the separation and measurement of the most minute double stars, such as σ and η Coronae Borealis, in its sharp definition of the double ring of Saturn, and various other of the most delicate celestial objects. It is mounted on a polar axis of brass, furnished with declination and hour circles of the same metal, the work of the late Mr. Sisson; being, in fact, those of the old equatorial sector of the Royal Observatory, committed to our care for this purpose by the Council of the Royal Society (to whom our thanks are therefore due) and of which a more particular de-\n\n* Under favourable circumstances, with a power of 600, the discs of the two stars of η Coronae and of σ Coronae; of ξ Bootis and of ζ Orionis, are shown perfectly round, and as sharply defined as possible.\nscription, accompanied with a plate, will be found in page 141 of Vince's Practical Astronomy. The axis is supported by strong piles of wood sunk deep into the earth; and though not quite exempt from tremors, is sufficiently so for the performance (with due care) of the most accurate and delicate measurements. The telescope is furnished with a micrometer, the work of Troughton, similar in all respects to that of the five feet just described, with the exception of a peculiar apparatus carrying an additional moveable cross wire, for a purpose not connected with the present paper. The ordinary observing power employed with this telescope was 179, but occasionally a lower power of 105, and a higher one of 273, were also used. The illumination of the field is effected by a lamp attached to the tube, and (as in the five feet), may be increased or diminished to any extent.\n\nThe values of the parts of the scale of each micrometer were determined by separating the wires a certain known number of revolutions and parts, and having placed them in the direction of the meridian, measuring repeatedly the time occupied by the passage of an equatorial star, or other of known declination, from wire to wire. By this method, one part of the scale of the five-feet micrometer was ascertained to represent $0''.31582$, and of the seven feet, $0''.24044$. The equality of the threads of the screw was proved by the same value resulting, whatever opening of the wires was employed; and the parallelism* of them in either micrometer was perfect. The position of the declination wire, when set to zero, was frequently examined by running a star\n\n* The wires employed in these micrometers, are spider's lines of extreme tenuity, and were inserted by Mr. Simms.\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent from one end to the other, backwards and forwards, by the right ascension motion of the instrument; but being once well adjusted, was found liable to no change, except in one instance, when the micrometer had received a blow, the defect produced by which was immediately discovered and rectified.\n\nRespecting the precautions used in observing, a few words will suffice. In measuring distances, the stars were bisected by both wires, and kept on them by means of the long handle of the slow R. A. motion, held in the left hand, and gently turned between the finger and thumb, the right being at liberty to manage the micrometer. This, though rather difficult at first, becomes easy by a little practice, and even in unfavourable positions, the effect of the earth's diurnal motion may be almost exactly neutralised with a little management. The measures of distance are therefore all central, a circumstance the more necessary to be noticed, by reason of the greater size of the spurious discs of stars in refracting, than in reflecting telescopes. In taking angles of position, these spurious discs are often extremely troublesome, as their inequality renders it very difficult (especially in close stars), to judge of the position of the line joining their centres. In such cases a green, or even a slightly smoked glass, was sometimes used in viewing bright stars, or advantage taken of the favourable intervention of a thin cloud, which reduces them to mere points, or even of broad daylight, to obliterate their rings and scattered light, &c. Such cases are noticed when they occur, but it may not be amiss to mention, that the angle of position of a pair of very close stars, or very unequal ones, at a moderate distance, (such as ε Bootis, β Orionis, &c.), can never be obtained with any degree of certainty by a single\nmeasure, especially when the two stars, as in the above instances, differ greatly in colour.\n\nThe requisite degree of illumination is a matter of great consequence, and differs in almost each particular star. In relation to this, a singular phænomenon deserves mention. Many very minute stars bear, without extinction, strong degrees of illumination, and are even seen the better for it, while others, apparently brighter, have been found unable to bear even the slightest extraneous light. This may probably be owing to an excess of blue light in the star, forming a contrast with the ruddy tint of the lamp illumination: at least, the most remarkable instances* of the phænomenon in question are, those in which the small star is decidedly of a blue colour.\n\nA rather singular method of obtaining a view, and even a rough measure of the angles of stars of the last degree of faintness, has often been resorted to, viz. to direct the eye to another part of the field. In this way, a faint star in the neighbourhood of a large one, will often become very conspicuous, so as to bear a certain illumination, which will yet totally disappear, as if suddenly blotted out, when the eye is turned full upon it, and so on, appearing and disappearing\n\n---\n\n* σ Scorpii is much improved by illumination.\nη Lyrae.

Frequently, \nhowever, this disposition, dictated by convenience, was \nchanged, and the observations made by one were read off, \nas well as written down, by the other, and the results not \ncommunicated till the measures were finished. This mode \nof checking each other's measures, the severest which can \nwell be resorted to when two persons observe together, was \nhowever only adopted, when, from a discrepancy in the first \nmeasures, some suspicion of a bias in the eye, or judgment \nof one or other, arose, in cases of peculiar interest, or in \nthe earlier part of the work, before practice had confirmed \nour confidence. When the two instruments were used at once \nhowever, which during the last year's observations was al-\nmost perpetually the case, the observers were necessarily \nseparated from each other, and their results only communi-\ncated on the following morning, at the time of taking and \napplying the index errors.\n\nIn a very few instances, the assistance of a third person has \nbeen called in, to give a turn to our opinion in a doubtful case. \nMr. Richardson, of the Royal Observatory, has generally\n\n* η Persei; 7 Tauri; 43 Persei; 1 Leporis (R. A. 5ʰ 4ᵐ); 63 (p.) Geminorum.\nbeen the person selected for this purpose, as possessing the necessary qualifications of an eye practised* in observations with this particular instrument, a correct hand, and unbiased impartiality. A few measures by Mr. Troughton will also be found on similar occasions.\n\nOf the general disposition of the following paper, it will now be necessary to give some account. The stars observed by us, are arranged in order of right ascension, and such names, synonyms, and references are attached, as will serve to identify them in the writings of other astronomers. The catalogues of Mr. South† and Mr. Struve,‡ have been extremely useful to us; the latter being much more extensive than the former, the number of each star, in the order in which it stands in that work, is annexed: the synonyms therein given are also generally adopted, with such additions and corrections as seemed necessary.\n\nOur observations will be found to include many stars given by Sir William Herschel, in his catalogue of 145 new double stars, printed in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, Vol. 1. These are cited by their numbers (for instance, 41 of the 145.) Some few discovered by ourselves, are either mentioned as new, or may be known by the absence of any other reference. The right ascensions and declinations are generally those of Struve. When de-\n\n* Prior to his appointment at Greenwich, Mr. Richardson, by daily experience, had been long familiar with the Blackman-street instruments.\n\n† This catalogue was arranged in the year 1818, by Mr. S. and was intended for private use only; at the request, however, of the Reverend Dr. Pearson, it was communicated to the Astronomical Society, in the spring of 1820.\n\n‡ This catalogue, unfortunately, did not reach us till the commencement of the present year.\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent determined by ourselves, they may be regarded as true to the nearest minute in declination (unless for southern stars, where the neglect of refraction will entail a larger error), and to a few seconds in R. A. The identification of the stars being our only* object, greater accuracy was not attempted, than would suffice for setting the instrument directly upon them.\n\nNext follow our observations as written down at the time, or at least as allowed to stand, at the moment of terminating the measure. It would have been easy indeed, by giving only the mean results of whole sets of measures, to have produced an appearance of very exact coincidences; but this has not been so much our object, as to show, by an actual exposé of the whole work, what degree of confidence is due to our results, and what extent of deviation from mean quantities, other observers, who may enter upon the same enquiry with similar instruments, may fairly expect to meet with. In this respect, very few liberties have been taken.\n\n* To have rendered this paper as complete as possible, it was Mr. South's intention to have accompanied it with the observed places of each principal star, brought up to a particular epoch, and some progress towards effecting it was actually made so far back as February, 1821: but, although the transits of fifty stars, over all the wires of his instrument, were occasionally observed by him in one night, the scheme was found to interfere so much with the primary object, that it was deemed advisable to relinquish it. Should, however, their places remain undetermined, possessing, as he does, the instrumental means of ascertaining them, with the greatest accuracy, his original design, (if health allow), will probably be not abandoned. Still, it must be remembered, that, two or three hundred double stars yet remain unmeasured; this done, the period must be distant, ere a private individual can, with his own eyes, (be his industry great as it may), furnish standard observations, both in Right Ascension and Declination, of seven hundred stars, many of which are only visible in the illuminated fields of our large meridian instruments, under circumstances which, in this country, are of very rare occurrence.\nWhen indeed a measure (on looking down the list, without reference to the observations of former nights) was found to differ considerably from the rest, the micrometer was usually set to the suspicious reading off, and the measure re-examined by both observers. If declared erroneous (and the contrary would occasionally happen), it was corrected by him whose measure it originally was, and the result set down in the place of that rejected. In general, the degree of discordance in the measures of any particular star, may be taken as a pretty fair criterion of the difficulty which attended the observation.\n\nThe instrument with which each set of measures was taken, is mentioned. In the north preceding and south following quadrants, the micrometers show angles of position complementary to the true ones. These are, however, (except in one or two instances) set down as read off, and the mean afterwards subtracted from $90^\\circ$. In the measures of distance, the index error is applied to the mean of the micrometer parts in each set, and the result reduced into seconds is stated. The index error was at first only taken at pretty considerable intervals; but, being soon found liable to a trifling change, it was afterwards regularly taken on the morning after each night's observation, or at least as soon as circumstances would permit. The zeros applied are means of at least five, but frequently of ten separate determinations.\n\nIn order to make this paper more complete, and to save trouble to those who may wish to consult our measures, or prosecute farther this interesting department of astronomy, we have presented at the end of our observations of each star, 1st, the mean result of our own measures, reduced to a mean\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent epoch, in computing which, each single measure (unless the contrary is expressly mentioned) is supposed to have the same weight: and, 2dly, a brief statement of all the results obtained by other observers, as far as they are known to us, arranged in the order of their dates, for the sake of comparison with our own, so as to give, as it were, a history of all that is known on the subject. Among them, a multitude of hitherto unpublished observations of Sir W. Herschel are inserted from his Journals and Registers; many lacunæ in the history of particular stars filled up, and the chain of observation continued unbroken up to the present time. One or two points here require notice. 1st. The dates of his observations will generally be found to differ from those attached to the description of the stars in his Catalogues. The reason is, that the dates here given are those of the observations, as they occur in the Journals, or their mean, if more than one, while the dates in the Catalogues are those when the stars were first discovered to be double. 2dly, Both the angles and distances will also be frequently at variance with those printed in Sir William's Catalogues. This must be explained more at large. Unless a mean result is expressly mentioned, the 'angles and distances in his Catalogues are invariably the results of single measures. However numerous the measures taken, one has been selected as the best, and all the rest rejected. So great a degree of confidence in single measures, however, is hardly borne out by our experience; and the results we have inserted from the Journals and Registers, are therefore the means of all that could be found, such only being rejected as offer something obviously objectionable. We have only to cast our eyes at the obser-\nvations of Rigel, to see how widely they differ from each other, and yet how exactly their mean agrees with that of our own, to be satisfied that, in so doing, not only no improper liberty is taken, but much valuable labour rescued from oblivion, which would otherwise have been lost to science. In numerous instances, too, whole series of observations have been found, and their mean results inserted. These are generally noted by the letters MSS. annexed.\n\nFinally, such remarks are subjoined as comparisons of modern with ancient measures of the same star suggest. In numerous instances they confirm the changes previously surmised to have taken place by Sir W. Herschel, in his papers of 1803 and 1804. In a few they afford no such satisfactory confirmation. In more than one instance, they furnish important verifications of the proper motions assigned to particular stars by Maskelyne, Piazzi, and others; while in some, on the other hand, the degree of permanence in the relative situations of the large and small stars is hardly less remarkable.\n\nAfter the main body of observations, we have added a list of a few stars less perfectly measured, or of which, from their uncommon difficulty, the observations are too precarious to be received as satisfactory. The only reason for inserting them is, that should there ever hereafter arise a question respecting them, any measures made with some care and with good instruments are better than none at all, and may become useful, though confessedly imperfect data. This reason is strengthened by the probability that their difficulty, and the little apparent interest they offer, will cause them to be dis-\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent regarded by future observers, till peculiar views occur to recal them to attention.\n\nFor the convenience of those who may wish to examine the micrometrical reductions, we have subjoined the following tables.\n\nValues of Five feet Equatorial Micrometer.\n\n| Rev. | Parts. | Parts. | Parts. | Parts. |\n|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1    | 0.31582 | 10.31626 | 8.21151 | 16.107 |\n| 2    | 1.3164  | 20.63227 | 8.52752 | 16.423 |\n| 3    | 1.34747 | 30.94728 | 8.84353 | 16.739 |\n| 4    | 2.6329  | 41.26329 | 9.15954 | 17.054 |\n| 5    | 2.37911 | 51.57930 | 9.47555 | 17.370 |\n| 6    | 3.9493  | 61.89431 | 9.79056 | 17.686 |\n| 7    | 3.41075 | 72.21132 | 10.10657 | 18.002 |\n| 8    | 4.12658 | 82.52733 | 10.42258 | 18.318 |\n| 9    | 4.44249 | 92.84234 | 10.73859 | 18.633 |\n| 10   | 5.15822 | 103.15835 | 11.05460 | 18.949 |\n| 11   | 5.47404 | 113.47436 | 11.37061 | 19.265 |\n| 12   | 6.18986 | 123.79037 | 11.68562 | 19.581 |\n| 13   | 6.50569 | 134.10638 | 12.00163 | 19.897 |\n| 14   | 7.22151 | 144.42239 | 12.31764 | 20.212 |\n| 15   | 7.53733 | 154.73740 | 12.63365 | 20.528 |\n| 16   | 8.25315 | 165.05341 | 12.94966 | 20.844 |\n| 17   | 8.56897 | 175.36942 | 13.26567 | 21.160 |\n| 18   | 9.28480 | 185.68543 | 13.58068 | 21.476 |\n| 19   | 10.062  | 196.00144 | 13.89669 | 21.791 |\n| 20   | 10.31644| 206.31645 | 14.21270 | 22.108 |\n| 21   | 11.32262| 216.63246 | 14.52871 | 22.423 |\n| 22   | 11.34808| 226.94847 | 14.84472 | 22.739 |\n| 23   | 12.6391 | 237.26448 | 15.15973 | 23.056 |\n| 24   | 12.37973| 247.58049 | 15.47574 | 23.371 |\n| 25   | 13.9555 | 257.89550 | 15.79175 | 23.687 |\nValues of Seven-feet Equatorial Micrometer.\n\n| Rev. | Parts. | Parts. | Parts. | Parts. | Parts. | Parts. |\n|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1    | 0.24.044 | 10.24086 | 6.25151 | 12.263 | 76.18.274 | .10.024 |\n| 2    | 0.48.089 | 20.48127 | 6.49252 | 12.503 | 77.18.514 | .20.048 |\n| 3    | 1.12.132 | 30.72128 | 6.73253 | 12.743 | 78.18.754 | .30.072 |\n| 4    | 1.36.177 | 40.96229 | 6.97354 | 12.984 | 79.18.995 | .40.096 |\n| 5    | 2.02.221 | 51.20230 | 7.21355 | 13.224 | 80.19.235 | .50.120 |\n| 6    | 2.24.266 | 61.44331 | 7.45456 | 13.465 | 81.19.476 | .60.144 |\n| 7    | 2.48.310 | 71.68332 | 7.69457 | 13.705 | 82.19.716 | .70.168 |\n| 8    | 3.12.354 | 81.92333 | 7.93558 | 13.946 | 83.19.957 | .80.192 |\n| 9    | 3.36.398 | 92.16434 | 8.17559 | 14.186 | 84.20.197 | .90.216 |\n| 10   | 4.04.443 | 102.40435 | 8.41560 | 14.427 | 85.20.438 |        |\n| 11   | 4.24.487 | 112.64536 | 8.65661 | 14.667 | 86.20.678 |        |\n| 12   | 4.48.531 | 122.88537 | 8.89662 | 14.907 | 87.20.918 |        |\n| 13   | 5.12.576 | 133.12638 | 9.13763 | 15.148 | 88.21.159 |        |\n| 14   | 5.36.620 | 143.36639 | 9.37764 | 15.388 | 89.21.399 |        |\n| 15   | 6.06.664 | 153.60740 | 9.61865 | 15.629 | 90.21.640 |        |\n| 16   | 6.24.709 | 163.84741 | 9.85866 | 15.869 | 91.21.880 | 0.002 |\n| 17   | 6.48.753 | 174.08742 | 10.09967 | 16.110 | 92.22.121 | 0.005 |\n| 18   | 7.12.797 | 184.32843 | 10.33968 | 16.350 | 93.22.361 | 0.007 |\n| 19   | 7.36.842 | 194.56844 | 10.57969 | 16.591 | 94.22.602 | 0.010 |\n| 20   | 8.08.886 | 204.80945 | 10.82070 | 16.831 | 95.22.842 | 0.012 |\n| 21   | 8.24.930 | 215.04946 | 11.06071 | 17.071 | 96.23.082 | 0.014 |\n| 22   | 8.48.975 | 225.29047 | 11.30172 | 17.312 | 97.23.323 | 0.017 |\n| 23   | 9.13.019 | 235.53048 | 11.54173 | 17.552 | 98.23.563 | 0.019 |\n| 24   | 9.37.063 | 245.77149 | 11.78274 | 17.793 | 99.23.804 | 0.022 |\n| 25   | 10.1.107 | 256.01150 | 12.02275 | 18.033 | 100.24.044 |        |\n\nBlackman Street,\nNov. 19, 1823.\n\nJ.

Herschel in 1783, and 1802. His first observation gives 25° 3' sp for the angle, while by the measure of 1802, it appeared to be 34° 33' sp. It is therefore enumerated by him among the stars in which a motion is suspected; but our observations do not confirm the suspicion. In the Journal of 1783, his measure is set down 1 Rev. + 49 1/2 — 46 1/2; 49 1/2 parts, or 19° 48', being the correction for Zero. If we suppose a mistake in reading off, and that the true measure were 3 Rev. — 49 1/2 — 46 1/2, all the observations would agree, as this corresponds to 33° 27' sp; and some peculiarities in the mode of setting down the observations of that night, make this not improbable.\n\n1821.45.

If we leave out this doubtful observation, and compute the most probable annual motion from this table by the formula (1) we obtain 0°.5133, which is the angle described per annum in the direction nfsp. If we compute back from the last observation as an epoch, with this mean motion, the comparison between the observed and calculated angles will stand as follows:\n\n| Date    | Calculated Angles | Observed Angles | Difference |\n|---------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|\n| 1821.9  | 7°.9' nf          | 7°.9' nf        | 0°.0'      |\n| 1819.8  | 9 .0              | 9 .8            | +0 .8      |\n| *1814.08| 11 .7             | 11 .5           | -0 .2      |\n| *1814.13| 11 .7             | 19 .3           | +7 .6      |\n| 1803.1  | 17 .6             | 19 .2           | +1 .6      |\n| 1782.4  | 28 .2             | 27 .9           | -0 .3      |\n\nThe observations marked with an asterisk are the two\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent from whose mean the angle of 1814 was concluded.

The distance having diminished almost $3''$, the apparent orbit is evidently elliptic, but the data at present are not sufficiently precise, and the arc embraced not large enough, to ground any calculation of its position and elements on.

The rate of decrease, calculating on all the observations according to the formula (1) is no more than $0^\\circ.117$ per annum, in the direction np sf, or retrograde. Supposing it to revolve uniformly in a circle, its period would at this rate be 3077 years.\n\nThe distance, in 1783, was $1\\frac{1}{2}$ diameter of the large star. M. STRUVE, in 1819, made it $5''.77$, with which ours coincides, almost to minute precision. The distance, therefore, as well as the angle, seems to be subject to a slow variation, as a diameter and half between the discs, in equal stars of the 7th magnitude, can hardly exceed $4''$ from centre to centre.\n\nNo. X.

In Polaris, the annual variation of the angle (being $sp$) is $-195'' = -3' 15''$. Hence the correction for 42 years is $-2^\\circ 16'$, which, applied to the measure of $1781.50$, reduces it to $64^\\circ 46'.sp$. The observation of $1802$ similarly treated, becomes $60^\\circ 38'$, coinciding very well with the present angle. A correction similar in principle, will of course be required for all the stars, after the lapse of long periods; and the only way to obviate the necessity of using it, would be to refer all the angles to the ecliptic, and its parallels; but we are at present very far from the necessity of a reduction requiring so much labour.\ndistances and positions of 380 double and triple stars, &c.\n\nNo. XVI.

The star here observed was found by setting the equatorial to the place of $10$ Trianguli. STRUVE, (Dorpat Obs. ii. 167, Obs. 144), makes $10$ Trianguli a double star, but gives\nits position $24^\\circ 12'$ sp, and calls the stars 8 and 7.8 magnitudes. The star IV. 40, is called simply Fl. 10 Trianguli (a) in the Catalogue of 1782; but in the MSS. Journal for that year we find this remark, \"My IV. 40, is near 10. It is the preceding telescopic star of a small triangle, whereof the largest is 10 Trianguli.\" The distance of IV. 40, in 1781, was $17''.317$. So that if this be the star, its distance must have decreased considerably. But when every circumstance is equivocal, it is useless to conjecture.\n\nNo. XXXII. R.

It is, in consequence, inserted in the Catalogues of Struve and South as $117$: $117$ however is single, and this star was found by us in sweeping for it. On consulting the original MSS. we find the following observation, which clearly establishes the identity of III. 93 with the star measured by us.\n\n\"III. 93.

Yet, had it been then as distinctly separated as at present, it is not possible it could have been overlooked, when kept long enough in view to take an accurate measure, in the course of which the attention must have been closely directed to either star. Still less could it have escaped notice in the reviews of the heavens, in the course of which it has often been examined with minute attention with reference to this very point, as the Journals written at the time testify. On the 29th of September, 1782, during one of the reviews on which the Catalogue of 1785 is founded, it was examined with the 7 feet reflector, power 460, and is called \"white, distinctly round, double,\" the double referring obviously to the more distant star, and the \"distinctly round\" to the principal, or central one, according to usual custom. A beautiful star of the first class could never have escaped registering by neglect, when the object was expressly to form a Catalogue of such stars, and we are therefore forced to conclude, that in 1782, the small star was so closely covered by the large one, as not even to elongate its disc.\n\nζ Herculis and δ Cygni have afforded instances of sidereal occultations, in which one star has completely disappeared behind the other, and σ Coronæ appears to be on the point of performing the same singular evolution. This is the first instance, however, of the reverse process, for the observation MDCCCXXIV.\nζ Orionis continued.\n\nof M. Flaugergues, on ζ Ursæ Majoris, (mentioned under the head of that star), which would be a strong case in point, is proved to have been an illusion.

In 63.3 years the change of the angle of position amounts to $61^\\circ.5$, being on the average $0^\\circ.971$ per annum. The mean angular velocity, computed from the ensemble of the above observations, giving them all equal weight, is $0^\\circ.965$. Meanwhile the distance continues precisely what it was. This would indicate a circular orbit at right angles to the line of MDCCCXXIV.\nCastor continued.\n\nsight; but it is most probable that the orbit is elliptic, and merely projected into a circle; for if we examine the foregoing angles attentively, we shall find that the angular velocity is sensibly retarded; for, in the period of 20.0 years elapsed between the observations of 1759 and 1779, we find an angle of $23^\\circ.7$ described, being $1^\\circ.185$ per annum. In the next period of 22.2 years to the measures of 1802 (which from the number taken may be relied on), $21^\\circ.4$ only were described, giving an angular velocity of $0^\\circ.964$, or about the average; while in the third (and probably most accurate) period of 21.1 years, only $16^\\circ.4$ were described, giving an angular velocity of $0^\\circ.777$ per annum, being as much below the average as that of the first 20 years is above it.\n\nR.A. $7^h\\ 23^m$.

The change of position has also been accompanied with a considerable diminution of distance; and further observations must decide whether this is the result of rectilinear or orbital motion. If the former,\nthe minimum of distance will be attained in about 40 years from the present time, and the change during that period much less rapid than heretofore. On the other hand, an orbital motion will be indicated by the distance continuing to diminish beyond that limit, and probably too by an acceleration in the angular motion. A certain acceleration indeed is already perceptible, 10° having been described in the first twenty years, and $13^\\circ \\frac{1}{2}$ in the last; but no great reliance is to be placed on this, as the earlier measures depend only on single observations. Meanwhile the change remarked by Sir W. Herschel in his paper of 1804, is fully confirmed both by M. Struve's observations and our own.\n\nNo. XCI. R.

Sir W. Herschel, by the measure of Jan. 23, 1783, made the position $32^\\circ 9'$ nf, and the interval only $1\\frac{1}{2}$ diameter of the large star, which can hardly (for stars of this magnitude) exceed $4''$ distance from centre to centre. The angle described in 39.06 years is $20^\\circ 07'$, giving an annual angular motion of $-0^\\circ 514'$, being in the direction $n p s f$ or retrograde.\nMr. Struve has determined the difference of declinations of the two stars composing this remarkable double star. His measure, reported in Zach's Correspondence Astron. viii. p. 370, was performed with a new wire micrometer by Fraunhofer, and gave for the result $4''.85$. If we calculate the difference of declinations from our angle and distance given above, we find $4''.78$ for its amount, differing only $0''.07$ from Struve's.\n\n1820.92.

Occasionally each observer read off the other's measure, and each declared his eye offended by the situation of the micrometer wire as left by the other. The differences being found irreconcilable, other practised observers were called in to decide the point, whose measures, as will be seen, had no such effect. However the mean angle 65° 57' here set down, being the result of 47 single measures, by four different observers, and on five nights, embracing an interval of two years, cannot well be erroneous to any extent.\n\nMDCCCXXIV.\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent\n\nOther observations of this star are as follows:\n\n| Position | Distance |\n|----------|----------|\n| $62^\\circ 48' nf$ 1783.34; $12''.5$, 1783.10; H.

The angle thus obtained from no less than 58 measures, with its corresponding mean date, will serve for an epoch in which the computer,\nξ Ursæ Majoris continued.\n\nat some future period, may rely with confidence in any investigation relative to the orbit of this star.\n\nA double star in which the two stars are nearly equal, connected undoubtedly in a binary system by their mutual gravitation, and revolving round their common center of gravity with a motion so rapid as to admit of being traced, and measured from month to month, must be allowed to be a phenomenon of no common interest, and deserving every attention, both from the practical and theoretical astronomer. The rapid alteration of position in ξ Ursæ Majoris, was first pointed out and established by unequivocal observations by Sir W. Herschel, in his second \"Account of the changes that have happened in the relative situations of double stars,\" Phil. Trans. 1804, already so often referred to. The observations of M. Struve (who has called the attention of astronomers to it in a pointed manner) and our own, fully confirm it; at the same time that they indicate a remarkable alteration in its velocity, which can only be accounted for by supposing the relative orbit to be one of great ellipticity. The whole series of observations from the first notice of it as a double star, to the present time, will stand as follows:\n\nPosition.\n\n1781.97 (Dec. 19) $53^\\circ 47'$ sf; H.

In the next interval of\n16.93 years, $177^\\circ.75$ were described, being at the mean rate of $10^\\circ.499$ per annum. In the next period, of $1.74$ years, the angle described was $12^\\circ.03$, or $6^\\circ.914$ per annum; while in the succeeding short period of $1.54$ years, the motion amounted only to $6^\\circ.84$, or $4^\\circ.442$ per annum. It is therefore at present rapidly decreasing, and the maximum annual motion must, at some period between $1803$ and $1820$, have greatly exceeded $10^\\circ.499$, and perhaps may have amounted to $20$ or $30^\\circ$. This consideration would lead us to place the perihelion of the orbit in the north-preceding quadrant, between the $30$th and $60$th degree from the parallel, and to suppose its plane greatly inclined to the visual line, in a plane not far from that passing through the eye and the major axis of the orbit; and this agrees well with the change of distance, which is certainly less at present than in $1782$, though the estimation by diameters is necessarily very uncertain.\n\nIn the present imperfect state of the data, it would be useless to enter into any minute investigations respecting the elements of the orbit; but when twenty or thirty years observations shall have enabled us to trace precisely the variation of the angular motion up to the aphelion, and to ascertain, by direct observation, the periodic time and mean motion, the principles of physical astronomy may be applied, and the case is one particularly favourable to their application, so that we may hope one day to obtain a precise knowledge of all the most important points respecting this interesting system.\n\nIt is to be regretted that owing to an error in the place of this star in Bode's Catalogue, it was not observed by us at an earlier date; the comparison of our observations with those of M.

The computed occultation of Cassini in 1720 cannot have any dependance placed on it, as the lunar tables can hardly be supposed correct enough to carry us back 100 years from the present time, with the precision necessary for so delicate an object, unless corrected for that express purpose by some observations made about the time; and it may fairly be doubted whether the necessary degree of accuracy for such observations could then be attained. If we reject this, we shall find that a mean motion of 0°.667 per annum in the direction np sf (or retrograde) will nearly represent the measures, as the following statement will show.\n\n| Date | Observed Position | Calculated Position | Difference |\n|------|------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 1756.0 | 54°.4 np | 57°.6 np | -3°.2 |\n| 1781.9 | 4°.7 | 4°.3 | +0.4 |\n| 1803.2 | 3°.3 | 26°.2 | +4.1 |\n| 1820.2 | 15°.3 | 14°.8 | +0.5 |\n| 1822.3 | 13°.4 | 13°.4 | 0.0 |\n\nThe differences are no greater than may well be attributed to error of observation, while the whole amount of the\nγ Virginis continued.\n\nangular motion observed being no less than $41^\\circ$, places the fact of a great change beyond dispute. In the first $25.9$ years of this period the angle described was $13^\\circ.64$; in the next $21.3$ years, $10^\\circ.41$ were described; in the next $17.0$, the change was $15^\\circ.06$; and in the last $2y.1$, $1^\\circ.86$. The respective mean annual motions corresponding to which are $0^\\circ.527$, $0^\\circ.489$, $0^\\circ.886$ and $0^\\circ.886$. The change of distance is more than sufficient to account for the acceleration on the supposition of an elliptic orbit. The star is a very interesting one, and deserves to be narrowly watched.\n\nNo. CLI. R. A. $12^h\\ 36^m$; Decl. $2^\\circ\\ 54'$.

Sir W. Herschel saw it double on the 9th April, 1774, with a power of 211, and has given its measures in his first Catalogue as follows:\n\nPosition $56° 46' sf$; Distance $14''.50$, by two years observations, from 1779 to 1781. These measures coincide so closely with our own, that no suspicion can arise of any real considerable change in this star. The following strange observation of M. Flaugergues, recorded in the Connaisance des Temps, An. xi. page 360, is therefore the more surprising. After recounting his habitual observations of it,\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent as a trial of his telescopes, without ever noticing its being double, he goes on to say,\n\n\"Le 4 Août, 1787, à 8 heurs du soir, regardant cette étoile avec une telescope de 15 pouces, je vis avec surprise qu'elle était composée de deux étoiles, une grande et l'autre plus petite, distante entre elles du diamètre de la plus petite. La ligne passant par ces deux étoiles était dirigée à-peu-près vers ε du Bouvier.\"\n\n\"Depuis cette époque j'ai observé souvent ces deux étoiles, et j'ai reconnu que la distance entre elles augmentait continuellement. Ce progrès est actuellement bien sensible et il y a au moins quinze secondes de distance entre elles, c'est à-dire trois ou quatre fois plus que lorsque je fis cette observation. La petite étoile qui est la plus au sud a de plus beaucoup augmenté de grandeur et d'éclat.\"\n\nWe should not have noticed this observation, which can only be regarded as an instance of the effect of familiarity, in our judgment of an object's appearance, were it not that, by a singular coincidence, the earlier observations of Sir W. H. on this very star had suggested to him a similar idea of a rapidly increasing distance.\n\nOther measures of this star are,\n\n**Position—**\n\n| Year | Right Ascension | Declination |\n|------|----------------|-------------|\n| 1800 | 56° 1' s/f;     | Piazzi (on Struve's authority.) |\n| 1802 | 51° 14' s/f;    | Herschel (Account of the Changes, &c.) |\n| 1816 | 54° 40' s/f;    | Herschel, Junior, (7-feet reflector) MS. |\n| 1819 | 55° 20' s/f;    | Struve.

The closeness, and great difference of size and colour of the two stars, will partly account for this; but if we compare our measures of this with those of Rigel, in which the difference of size is much more considerable, and where the two stars are also very close (the distance being within $9''$) we shall find reason to believe that some other cause than mere imperfection of vision, bias of eye, or error in judgment, must have operated. There can be no doubt but that, had the micrometer been purposely deranged $16^\\circ$ after any measure with which the observer had been tolerably satisfied, he could not possibly have avoided noticing the change on reviewing his measure. The remark annexed to the observations of April 9, with the five-feet instrument, shows that a much less change proved intolerably offensive to the eye. Refraction, acting differently on two stars close together, and differing so decidedly in colour as these do, might be expected to produce great alterations in their relative apparent situations, but unluckily this will not account for the particular changes observed. The point requires farther investigation.

Letter to Baron de ZAON, Corr. Ast. viii. p. 216.\n\nIf we lay down the distances and angles here given on a scale (with the exception of M. Amici's, which is evidently much too small; indeed all his measures hitherto published, appear to err more or less on that side), the apparent relative orbit of the small star ss's\", will be found not to deviate much from a strait line, the slight degree of concavity towards the large one observable in it (See fig. 1, Plate IV.) being not to be depended on, on account of the uncertainty of the estimation on which the distance of 6\" depends. Moreover the motion in it will be found to be not far remote from uniformity. The position ss' and s' s\" being in the ratio of 18 to 24, and the times in that of 18:22. The obvious conclusion therefore is, that the two stars are unconnected, and the relative motion merely the difference of their proper motions; If so, both stars must have a considerable proper motion, for the large one (according to Piazzi) has one which alone would carry it in the sp direction, at an angle of about 40° from the parallel (and therefore almost directly away from the small star, at the rate of about 0\".30 per annum.) This would explain the increase of distance, but not the angular motion. To explain both it becomes necessary\nξ Bootis continued.\n\nto attribute to the small star a motion of $-0''.35$ in R.A., and $-0''.07$ in declination, those of the large one being $-0''.23$, and $-0''.18$. This, though very possible, is not very probable, unless we admit a connection of some kind between the stars, and other circumstances conspire to throw a doubt on the validity of the opposite conclusion. The first is, that either the position of 1804, or that of 1792, is certainly incorrect. The observation of 1791, when taken in combination with that of the following year, shows that about that time the angle of position must have been exactly a right one, the small star then being in the act of changing quadrants. Even with this concession, supposing the position to have been exactly north in 1791-2, and assuming this (1791.8) as an epoch, the angle described in the 10 preceding years will have been $24^\\circ$, while in the 11 succeeding ones it amounted to no more than $7^\\circ\\frac{1}{2}$ (up to 1803.25, the mean between the observations of 1802 and 1804) or $0''.68$ per annum. Yet this rapid diminution of angular velocity has not continued, for in the next 20 years, up to 1823, we find an angular motion of $13^\\circ$, or $0.65$ per annum, and taking only the observations of the last four years, it exceeds a degree per annum. These considerations indicate a considerable error, either in the measures of 1802, 1804, which corroborate each other, or in that of 1782, which is marked \"very exact.\" Here then we have a choice of difficulties, but fortunately a few years will enable us to decide. If the relative path of the small star be really the strait line it appears to be, the angle of position will never reach $50^\\circ np$, and the angular velocity will diminish continually from the present moment. On the other hand,\nif the stars form a binary system, the present angular velocity of about a degree per annum, will continue for some time nearly uniform, and in 15 or 20 years the limit of $50^\\circ np$ will be attained or passed.\n\nIf we give up the observations of 1802, 1804, and suppose the position to have been exactly north at the epoch 1792.8, the observations, both of angle and distance, will be nearly represented by a circular orbit, described with a mean motion of $1^\\circ.8$ per annum, and inclined at an angle of $13^\\circ 34'$ to the visual ray, supposing the intersection with the plane of projection to lie in the $np$ and $sf$ quadrants, at an angle of $70^\\circ$ with the parallel; but the data are too precarious to rely much on this conclusion.\n\nThere is a small star at about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ or 2 minutes distance, and at about $82^\\circ np$, which is not to be suspected with the seven-feet reflector (aperture 6 inches) and can barely be discerned by rare glimpses (knowing its place) in the ten (aperture 9 inches) but with the twenty-feet it is very conspicuous. This was observed by Sir W. Herschel, in 1792, to be in the same line with the two stars of $\\xi$, or rather, according to a diagram made at the time of observation, a little more ($3^\\circ$ by measurement of the diagram) to the preceding side of that line. It became interesting to re-observe this star, as a verification of the motion of $\\xi$. Accordingly, in the month of July last, the twenty-feet reflector (aperture 18 inches) being directed on it, $\\xi$ and the neighbouring small stars were seen as in fig. 2, Plate IV. The small star in question is 6, and is now decidedly on the following side of the line of junction of the two stars of $\\xi$, and that by a\nξ Bootis continued.\n\nquantity nearly what it ought to be, on the supposition of the reality of the motions above attributed to the two stars.\n\nIn the diagram above alluded to, fig. 2; 1 and 2 are the two stars of ξ; 3, 4, 5, 6, are pretty conspicuous stars, nearly of equal magnitudes, (i.e. of the 15th or 16th) and 7 is an excessively minute star, perhaps hardly exceeding the 20th magnitude, being almost the minimum visibile with this aperture.\n\nNo. CLXXXVIII.

Vide Zach. viii. p. 523.\n\nThe change in the position of the small star here is established by indisputable evidence; the star μ being fortunately placed at a very convenient distance to serve as a mark of reference, and nearly in the direction of the small star, being about 81° np. In 1781 it was remarked by Sir W. H. that the small star followed the line joining the large one and μ, and in 1802 that it had changed sides, and preceded the same line. Our observations and M. Struve's fully confirm this change. In the interval of 19.98 years between the observations of 1782 and 1802, the motion observed was 11°, and in the additional period of 20.75 years, a further motion in the same direction of 12°.55 appears to have taken\nplace, the distance remaining nearly the same. A more exact coincidence could hardly have happened. If this double star be a binary system, of which there can be little doubt, its period is about 622 years, and the most probable mean annual motion is $0^\\circ.5783$, in the direction $npsf$, or retrograde.\n\nWhether this combined system have a motion in space, or not, may be perhaps best ascertained by comparing its place now, and hereafter, with $\\mu$, and the data for this comparison will be found under the head of that star, as follows.\n\n**No. CCIV.**\n\nR.

This is a point of some importance, as the rotation of the small star (which is itself a close double star) is established by this fact. On the other hand, if the proper motions assigned by Piazzi ($-0''.30$ in R. A. and $+0''.16$ in declination) be correct, this fact would go to establish a connexion between the two stars; for supposing the small star at rest, the space passed over in its path by the large one amounts, in 40 years, to $13''.5$, which being inclined at an angle of $28^\\circ$ to the parallel in a $np$ direction, would subtend at the small one an angle of $5^\\circ 49'$, a quantity which could not have escaped measurement in so distant a star; either therefore Piazzi's proper motions are erroneous, or the two stars have a common proper motion.\ndistances and positions of 380 double and triple stars, &c.\n\nNo. CCV.

An interval of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) diameter of the small star would correspond to a central distance of about \\(2''\\frac{1}{4}\\) or \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\). M. Struve measured it in 1819, and found it \\(3''.42\\), a little larger than ours, but his measure was taken with a projection micrometer, and may be less accurate on that account; yet on the whole\nthere does appear an increase of distance. The angular velocity has undergone a considerable diminution, and as this corresponds with the increased distance, the orbit is probably elliptic, and so situated as to allow its ellipticity being visible without distortion. The mean annual motion is — $0^\\circ.726$, or retrograde.\n\nCCVI. R.

Mean of Obs. of 1823.\n\nWe have here an instance of a great and almost sudden acceleration in the angular velocity of the small star. In the interval of 20.95 years elapsed, between 1781 and 1802, the angle described was $23^\\circ.86$, giving a mean velocity of $1^\\circ.139$ per annum. In the next interval of 16.86 years the angle described was $38^\\circ.60$, or $2^\\circ.298$ a year; while from 1819.6 to 1823.83 the angle described amounted to $22^\\circ.55.$ in 3.23 years, or $6^\\circ.982$ per annum. This rapid increase of angular velocity has been accompanied with a very sensible diminution of distance. In the catalogue of 1782, the interval between the two stars is described as being full $\\frac{1}{4}$ diameter of the large star, with a power of 227; while, with the same power, M. STRUVE observed them only $\\frac{1}{3}$ diameter asunder; and the same assiduous observer remarks, that the stars ξ Ursæ and 17 Draconis, both of which are set down in the catalogues as closer than σ, are now farther asunder. Our observations corroborate this diminution of distance; σ Coronæ is now a very difficult star to separate, almost equally so with η, and requiring the most favorable\ncircumstances for its measurement. Indeed the distance of the centres is less in \\( \\sigma \\) than in \\( \\eta \\), a mean of 12 capital observations having given us \\( 1''.455 \\) for the former distance on the 5th of June, 1823, while \\( \\eta \\), on the same extraordinary night, measured \\( 1'.577 \\); but the greater inequality of the stars of \\( \\sigma \\) favours their separation.\n\nTo explain these phenomena we may suppose, first, that the orbit is elliptic, and the star approaching its perihelion. But this would require a much greater variation of distance than appears to have taken place, to produce the effect, without the assistance of a second supposition, viz. that of the motion being performed in a plane passing nearly through the eye. Without therefore going into the minutiae of an elliptic orbit, let us conceive the small star to describe a circle about the large one, in a plane 30° inclined to the visual line, and intersecting the plane of projection in the line SA which joined the two stars at the moment of the first observation. Taking the mean motion in the orbit at \\( 2^\\circ.13 \\) per annum, after the lapse of any number \\( t \\) of years from 1781.79, the angle apparently described from A, or the angle ASP will be had by the trigonometrical theorem\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\text{ASP} = \\sin 30^\\circ \\cdot \\tan (t \\times 2^\\circ.13).\n\\]\n\nAnd the angle of position fSP will = 102° 28′ — ASP. If then we calculate the apparent places by this formula for all the times of observation, we get as follows.\nMr. Herschel's and Mr. South's observations of the apparent\n\nσ Coronæ continued.\n\n| Time     | Computed Position | Observed Position | Difference |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1781.79  | 77° 32' np        | 77° 32' np        | 0° 0'      |\n| 1802.74  | 76° 13' nf        | 78° 36' nf        | +2° 23'    |\n| 1819.60  | 30° 58' nf        | 40° 0' nf         | +9° 2'     |\n| 1821.30  | 24° 9' nf         | 24° 45' nf        | +0° 36'    |\n| 1823.43  | 16° 16' nf        | 16° 1' nf         | -0° 15'    |\n| 1823.52  | 15° 52' nf        | 18° 51' nf        | -2° 59'    |\n| 1822.83  | 18° 38' nf        | Mean Pos. 18° 27' nf | -0° 11' |\n\nA moderate ellipticity, and a proper assumption of the place of the perihelion, would probably reconcile the anomalies these differences present, which however, with the exception of that deduced from Mr. Struve's observation in 1819, are all small; but the extreme difficulty of the star would reconcile even greater anomalies than these.\n\nNo. CCXXIII.

The motion of these stars appears exceedingly capricious, the diminution of angular velocity since the year 1821 being so great and sudden as almost to throw a doubt on the observations made after that time. The agreement between our measures and those of M. STRUVE in that year, is sufficient to prove that we have observed the same star, and all other observations on it were made with the utmost care, in nights selected for their clearness, &c., and when the telescope was in its best action. Had the angular\n70 p Ophiuchi continued.\n\nmotion continued nearly uniform from 1821, at its former rate of about $6^\\circ$ per annum, the position, at the time of the observations of 1822, should have been $60^\\circ sf$, and on the 9th of April, 1823, about $54^\\circ$. The notes annexed to the last set of observations contain the result of two trials made to ascertain the quantity of error the eye would bear in a single measure of this star. When purposely set, either way, $2^\\circ \\frac{1}{2}$ from the mean, the micrometer wire was found to be intolerably out of place. The corrections were cautiously made so as barely to give satisfaction, and from their readings off we are fairly entitled to conclude that no satisfactory measure can deviate above a degree, or a degree and a half from the truth, at most. On the 9th April the micrometer wire was purposely set to $90^\\circ - 33 = 57^\\circ sf$, but its position was so offensive as to be marked \"shocking;\" and when set to $51^\\circ$ it had no appearance of ever being intended for a measure, the wire actually passing between the stars. Admitting the correctness of our measures and those of M. Struve in 1819, 1820, the mean angular velocities, during the several different intervals of the observations, will stand as follows:\n\n| Observation | Mean annual motion |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| 1779 to 1802 | $5^\\circ.046$       |\n| 1802        | $6.619$            |\n| 1804        | $9.868$            |\n| 1819        | $11.000$           |\n| 1820        | $5.623$            |\n| 1821        | $1.037$            |\n| 1822        | $1.610$            |\n| 1779 to 1823 | Mean of the whole interval $6.811$ |\n\nTo account for so enormous a variation of angular velocity,\nwithin four years, would require very extravagant suppositions. Some of the observations are more probably erroneous, but where to place the error is not so easy to determine.

Struve's, but the latter is only the result of a single measure; and in the case of very close stars of very unequal magnitudes, and of opposite colours, a single measure can never have any dependance placed on it. We have instances of this kind in ε Bootis, Rigel, Struve's N° 480, &c. The distance however has undoubtedly undergone a remarkable change; in 1781 the interval with 460 was 2½ D, corresponding to about 4'' of distance between the centres. In 1802 it was four or five diameters, which could hardly represent less than 7'' central distance, while it now seems again on the decrease. This agrees with the idea of a rapid rotation of one star about the other in a plane nearly passing through the eye, the small star being at its greatest elon-\n59 α Serpentis continued.\n\ngation about 1802. The inference is an interesting one, as this star seems not unlikely to furnish another example in addition to those already known of a sidereal occultation, which the difference of colours of the two stars, and the rapidity of their motion, will render a most curious phenomenon.\n\nNo. CCLXIX.

The angle of position of this was shown by Sir W. Herschel, in his paper of 1804, to have undergone a change of 6° 22' in the interval of 22 years, from 1780 to 1802.

The motion of the star is therefore in a direction 42° inclined to the\nparallel in the np quadrant, and therefore making an angle of $84^\\circ$ with the position of the small star. Its velocity is $0''.375$ per annum, or $15''$ in 40 years. The change observed in the angle of position of the small star is in the same sense therefore as that which would result from the proper motion of $\\alpha$, the small star remaining at rest, and its quantity (reckoning from the year 1792, the observations of that year being of course to be preferred from the great superiority of the instrument employed) $15^\\circ 54'$, is almost precisely that which such a supposition would give it ($15^\\circ 47'$), while the small decrease in the distance, since 1792, is also conformable to the same hypothesis. There is therefore every presumption: 1st, that the proximity of the large and small stars is merely apparent and accidental, no connection existing between them; and 2dly, that the proper motions assigned to $\\alpha$ are not very remote from truth.\n\nNo. CCLXXIII.

It is also said to have been seen through a 12 feet telescope (by Short) surrounded by five small stars. Doubtless, in a part of the heavens so crowded with stars, numbers of minute stars may be seen near it in good telescopes; but the division of one of the large stars into two is a fact we may be allowed to doubt.

We may fairly regard our mean result as true to $0''.1$ in distance, and $\\frac{1}{2}$ a degree, or even less, in the angle. The angle of position deduced from the right ascensions and declinations of the stars at so early a period as Bradley's observations, cannot merit much reliance.

The proper motion of α is not sufficient to account for it, for this is such as would alone carry it almost directly towards the small star with a velocity of 0''.634 per annum. Were the small star at rest then, the large one should have approached it by 26''.63, with a variation of the angle of position of not more than two or three degrees, and that in a contrary direction to what has actually happened. To account for the phenomena, if the proper motion assigned to α be correct, the small star must have a motion nearly in the same direction as α, and somewhat more rapid.\n\nNo. CCCIX. R.

If the observations of 1804 and 1823 be correct, that of 1781 cannot be so; and vice versa, if the latter be correct, a great error must exist in one or both of the others. The measures are of the utmost difficulty. Our observations were each made without the others knowledge, and neither observer thought the slightest confidence could be placed in his measures, it being even uncertain whether the small star had really been seen at all, or in lieu of it some optical illusion. The agreement of the results with different instruments however is a great proof of their reality.\n\nNo. CCCXII. R.

A., and $+3''.30$ in declination. This affords indisputable proof of their connection in a binary system, otherwise the lapse of nearly 70 years, during which they have been observed, one of them would doubtless have left the other behind, without supposing a coincidence too extraordinary to have resulted from accident. Of the reality of this proper motion we have satisfied ourselves by a series of more than 500 micrometrical comparisons of the large star with minute stars in the neighbourhood, which will more properly be reserved for another communication.\n\nThe mean angular motion, as deduced from the micrometrical measures of 1781, 1819, 1822, (regarding the latter as perfectly correct) comes out $0''.7386$ per annum. The\nmean motion deduced in like manner from a comparison of each of the remaining data with our mean result of 1822, comes out $0^\\circ.7196$, a very satisfactory coincidence when the nature of such a mode of determination is considered. The mean of both gives a mean annual motion of $0^\\circ.730$, in the direction $spnf$ or direct. If we employ this to compute the position at the several times of observation, assuming that of 1822 as correct, we shall have the following comparison:\n\n| Date   | Observed Position | Calculated Position | Error of Observation |\n|--------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1753.8 | $54.6 nf$         | $55.7 nf$           | $-1.1$              |\n| 1778.0 | $39.0$            | $38.1$              | $-0.9$              |\n| 1781.9 | $36.2$            | $35.2$              | $-1.0$              |\n| 1793.6 | $37.2$            | $26.7$              | $-10.5$             |\n| 1800.0 | $19.7$            | $22.0$              | $+2.3$              |\n| 1805.0 | $11.5$            | $18.4$              | $+6.9$              |\n| 1812.3 | $10.9$            | $13.0$              | $+2.1$              |\n| 1819.9 | $7.0$             | $7.5$               | $+0.5$              |\n| 1822.9 | $5.3$             | $5.3$               | $+0.0$              |\n\nThe errors are not greater than might be expected when we consider that the most important of them, $-10^\\circ.5$, is that of a single observation of each star by Lalande, and that an error of $2''$ in the difference of declination would suffice to produce it.\n\nThe mean angular motion of these stars then about their common centre of gravity is not far short of that of the two stars of Castor, while their apparent mutual distance is at\nleast three times as great.

Herschel in his paper of 1804 is therefore clearly confirmed. It is remarkable that M. Struve uniformly places the smaller star in the n-preceding quadrant, while our observations as regularly make it sp or nf, but the position is so nearly in the meridian that it is scarcely possible to perceive a bias one way or the other; and perhaps 90° n or s may be taken as the present situation without sensible error. In 42.37 years therefore the angle described is 19°, giving an average annual motion of 0°.4484 in the direction npsf or retrograde.\n\nAs the proper motion of ζ Aquarii (according to Piazzi) amounts to 0\".173 or 7\".266 in 42 years, and yet the stars of which it consists still retain the same distance and nearly the same relative situation with respect to each other; this circumstance alone amounts to a proof of their mutual connection, which their equal size corroborates, and renders it exceedingly probable that they form a binary system.\ndistances and positions of 380 double and triple stars, &c.\n\nNo. CCCXLVII.

HERSCHEL surmised to take place in this star, as is evident by comparing M. STRUVE's measure $114''.25$, taken in 1819.88, with the mean of two very accurate ones in 1780.69, which gives $113''.032$. Some mistake therefore must have been made in the measures $1'44''.218$ in the Catalogue of 1782, from which the motion was concluded with so much certainty. On searching the Journal for 1780 (September 8) two measures are found as follows:\n\n1st meas. 2 Rev. $59\\frac{1}{2} P - 3 = 1'44''.062$.\n\n2d meas. 3 Rev. o P - 3 = 1'44''.374.\n\nThe mean of these is $1'44''.218$, so that these are undoubtedly the measures referred to. They are however erroneously cast up, and a MS. correction (verified by re-computation) makes them respectively $1'50''.312$, and $1'50''.625$.\nNo. CCCLXII. continued.\n\nThe following is an arranged statement of all the measures of this remarkable star.\n\nPosition.\n2° 12' sf; Herschel.

By Observations made by Mr. South, at Passy, since the communication of this Paper, it appears that the angular motion of these stars continues at nearly the same rate (—5°.425), indicating indeed a slight diminution of velocity, but not to the extent supposed p. 150, which, therefore, must have arisen from M. Struve's observations of 1821 and 1822 being rather too much in advance.\n| No. | Page | *'s Name | R.

By fifteen observations made at Passy, by Mr. South, in April and May of the present year, the angle of position at the Epoch 1825.31 was 53° 17' or 53°.3, giving an apparent motion of 10°.1 in 2.0 years since the last observations in 1823, or 5°.05° per annum. This serves to render our observations of 1822 and 1823 yet more unaccountable, though it is still not easy to believe them erroneous, having been made with the greatest care. Mean while, if we take the whole interval from 1821 to 1825, the assemblage of our observations gives 3°.552 for the mean annual motion, so that the retardation of velocity noticed in p. 291 is on the whole satisfactorily confirmed. The distance remains nearly unchanged.\n\nPlate IV. Fig. 4, for Bassel, read Bessel.\n\nFrom the Press of\nW. NICOL,\nCleveland-row, St. James's, London.",
