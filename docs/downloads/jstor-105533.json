Observation of the Eclipse of the Sun, the 1st of April 1764, made in Surrey street, in the Strand, London: By James Short, M.A.F.R.S.\n\nRead April 5, 1763.\n\nThe morning of the eclipse I had provided the instruments I judged would be necessary for observing it in such a manner as to be satisfactory to the Royal Society as well as to myself. A reflecting telescope of two feet focal length, its aperture four inches and a half, and its magnifying power seventy times. To this telescope was fitted a micrometer with an achromic object-glass of 40 feet focal length.\n\nThe right honourable the Earl of Morton, now President of this Society, was pleased to honour me with his company, and also to observe; but in different rooms, out of sight and hearing of one another. His Lordship used a reflector of only eighteen inches focal length, four inches and a half aperture, and a power of forty times, to the eye-piece of which a helioscope was adapted, for viewing the Sun distinctly, without the least inconvenience to the eye.\n\nThe condition of the air was very unpromising, for, besides a general haziness of the sky, thin slow moving clouds were frequently passing over the Sun from\nfrom the South-west, so that it was by fits only that\nthe Sun's limb could be seen distinctly. I used a\nsmoked-glass to defend my eye, and my observati-\nons were noted down as follows.\n\nApparent time.\nMarch 31, 21 h 4' 33'' { the beginning of the eclipse\nby me.\n4' 36'' by Lord Morton.\n\nAll the rest by myself, with the before mentioned\nmicrometer.\n\nh 21 12 27 — 13 22, 0 = distance of the cusps.\n14 12 — 14 32, 1 = ditto.\n16 17 — 15 50, 8 = ditto.\n18 1 — 16 50, 6 = ditto.\n19 37 — 17 45, 4 = ditto.\n48 42 — 27 7, 1 = ditto.\n22 19 15 — 29 33, 2 = ditto.\n22 28 — 29 49, 5 = Moon's diameter nearly\nparallel to the horizon.\n23 58 — 29 49, 5 = ditto.\n26 10 — 2 58, 7 = greatest distance of Sun\nand Moon's limbs.\n28 28 — 2 31, 3 = ditto.\n30 43 — 2 26, 2 = ditto.\n32 8 — 29 49, 5 = Moon's diameter nearly\nparallel to the horizon.\n23 35 23 — 21 11, 4 = distance of the cusps.\n37 33 — 20 18, 4 = ditto.\n40 59 — 18 52, 9 = ditto.\n\nThe\nThe end could not be seen for clouds, but the whole of the eclipse may be determined from the above measurements.\n\nThe Sun's diameter parallel to the horizon, about an hour before noon on the day of the eclipse, was $31'59''$, 4, air hazy. The next day at the same hour it was $31'58''$, 6.\n\n**ADDITION.**\n\n| April 12 | 11 o P.M.

Observation of the Eclipse of the Sun, April 1, 1764: In a Letter from Dr. John Bevis, to Joseph Salvador, Esq; F. R. S.**\n\n**SIR,**\n\nRead April 5, 1764.\n\nThe honour you were pleased to do me by sending me an invitation to observe the late eclipse of the Sun at your house, and the accommodations I there met with, require that I should give you the best account I can of my observation, however imperfect through the unfavourableness of the weather.\n\nVol. LIII.",
