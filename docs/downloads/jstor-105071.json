Observations of the Weather in Madeira, made by Dr. Thomas Heberden, and communicated by William Heberden, M.D. F.R.S.\n\nRead Febr. 6, 1752.\n\nTHE thermometrical observations are made with Fahrenheit's thermometer, and the calculations deduced from two observations daily; at seven o'clock in the morning, and at three in the afternoon. The same method of calculation is to be understood of the barometer. The rain fell thro' a funnel 15 inches in diameter.\n\nThe Lefté, Levant, or hot winds, are very troublesome. The remedy is, to keep ourselves within-doors. October 1749, comparing 2 of Fahrenheit's thermometers together, one of them exposed on the north side of my house to the open air, the other within-doors, the difference was as follows:\n\n| Hour | Therm. within-doors | Therm. exposed to the air |\n|------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Lefté, Oct. 20. | 10 | 73 | 81 |\n|      | 12 | 76 | 82 |\n|      | 4  | 77 | 77 |\n\nMADEIRA\n### Madeira, Anno 1749.\n\n| Month     | Barometer | Thermometer |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n|           | Mean Height | Greatest Height | Least Height | M.
