Sir,\n\nThe Account I here send of the Horny Girl is, much more imperfect than I hoped it would have been, both because its parents or friends, who might give some information of the beginning and occasion of the growing out of these Horns, are not to be found, and that the owner of this Monster would not be persuaded to let us take the figure thereof, which we designed to present you.",
