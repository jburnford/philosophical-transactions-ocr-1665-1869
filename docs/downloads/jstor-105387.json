  "text": "XLI. Observations on the Comet seen in January 1760; by James Short, M.A. F.R.S. In a Letter to the Rev. Tho. Birch, D.D. Secretary to the Royal Society.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSurry-Street, 10 Jan. 1760.\n\nA Comet has made its appearance near the constellation of Eridanus, a little to the westward of Orion. Last night I took its transit over the meridian, and likewise its declination. Its nucleus is small, subtending an angle of not more than 5 or 6 seconds, but very visible thro' a two feet reflector magnifying about 70 times. Its motion is to the westward, with a considerable velocity, seemingly about 2 degrees in a day; for, about an hour and a half after I had taken its transit, I judged it had advanced about 10 or 12 minutes; which I find to be about the rate of the great comet, when it first was seen in the end of the year 1743. This comet is very visible to the naked eye, tho' I could perceive nothing of a tail; and therefore I conclude it is going down to the sun.\n\nComet passed the meridian 9th January 1760, at Mean time.\nIts declination south - 2° 15' 0\"\nRigel Orionis passed the meridian at - 9h 47' 49\"\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\nYour most humble servant,\nJa. Short.",
