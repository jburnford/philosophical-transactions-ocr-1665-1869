By Mr. Barr, Purveyor to his Majesty's Hospitals in Canada; communicated by Dr. Saunders.\n\nRead January 20, 1780.\n\nThe winter seemed to set in about the middle of November; from that time to the end of the month we had some snow and cold weather; but the thermometer never was lower than $16^\\circ$ or $18^\\circ$ below the freezing point.\n\nAbout the 24th and 25th of December people crossed the river three miles below Montreal.\n\nThe letters a and b after the figures denote the mercury to be above or below 0. The thermometer from which these observations were taken, was of Fahrenheit's construction; it was suspended to a post, perfectly in the shade, and no building nearer to it to reflect the heat than five or six feet.\n| Day | Thermometer | Snow | Rain | Winds | Remarks |\n|-----|-------------|------|------|-------|---------|\n|     | Morning     |      |      |       |         |\n|     | Evening

observing, that the great quantity of snow on the ground has, from the 29th of March to the 4th of April, been chiefly melted away by the heat of the sun, for the rain during that period has been very inconsiderable.\n\nNo refoulement of the river this spring; the ice gave way in the middle of the river first, and the opening has been growing larger and larger every day since the 28th of March, and is this day, the 4th of April, very large, although the ice remains fast on the border of the river.",
