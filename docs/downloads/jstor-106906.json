It will as readily be seen, that the same specific gravity results from adding together their equivalents in measure, Columns III. and IV. and that Column V. contains the quantity, which the two quantities really measure after the mixture has been made.\n\n---\n\n**ERRATA.**\n\nPage 281, column IV. line 34, for 126.12, read 125.12.\n\n283, —— I. —— 17, for 100 + 54, read 100 + 34.\n\nIbid. —— IV. —— 34, for 126.05, read 125.05.\n\nIbid. —— V. —— 2 from bottom, for 4866.96, read 4286.96.\n\n285, —— VIII. —— 23, for .5046, read .5056.\n\n286, —— IV. —— 8 from bottom, for 77.99, read 76.99.\n\n287, —— VIII. —— 23, for .5044, read .5054.\n\n289, —— II. —— 28, for .95485, read .95385.\n\n290, —— IV. —— 1 dele 0.84.",
