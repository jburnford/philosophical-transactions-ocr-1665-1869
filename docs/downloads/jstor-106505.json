Answer to the objections of M.

D. p. 144.\n\nA former volume of Transactions referred to, for the doctor’s reasons for concluding that all spots consisting of a dark nucleus and surrounding umbra, are excavations in the luminous matter, p. 145. His conviction thereof have been perfected by eight years subsequent observations, p. 146. Persons less used to examine objects with glasses may require more palpable dimensions of future great spots to behold these phenomena, ibid.\n\nThe objection that the absence of the umbra on one side, when spots are near the limb, is not constantly answered, p. 147. et seq. Messrs Cassini and De la Hire did not think any thing of moment depended on a new attention to the form of the spots, p. 148.\n\nThough some few spots may differ from all the rest, it will not warrant the conclusion that no spot can be an excavation, p. 149. How far spots, which near the middle of the disk appear equal and similar in all things, may yet differ from one another as excavations, &c. considered, ibid. Distinction between the nearest and farthest umbra, p. 150. Examples of the depth of the nucleus and the apparent breadth of the nearest umbra, of a spot of 40” all over, when the plane of the farthest comes to coincide with the visual ray, p. 151. Remarks thereon, ibid. Method of computing the distance of the nucleus from the limb when it is totally hid, p. 152. Why very shallow spots cannot always be known from the rest, p. 153.

Method of making the model, p. 155. Observations on the dark notches made in the sun’s disk, by the great spots seen in 1719, and June 3, 1703, p. 157; et seq. Those notches no proofs of projecting nuclei, or irreconcilable to spots being depressions in the sun, p. 158. The only admissible arguments, and which carry perfect conviction, concerning the nature of the spots, are those grounded upon the principles of optical projection, p. 159. Optical and physical arguments defined, p. 160. Dark and limited sphere of human reason, in regard to the economy of the sun, p. 161. That the spots are really excavations or depressions, is a fact established by optical arguments, ibid. and the only one the author contends for, p. 163.
