and so occasion remarkable Differences of the Lengths of Day and Night, in the same Revolutions, to Places under the same Parallels of Latitude; a whole Volume might be wrote in the Description, if the Author would descend to Particulars.

VII. A Machine for founding the Sea at any Depth, or in any Part, invented by Major Wm. Cock in the Year 1738. in a Voyage to Georgia.

Presented April 10. THE Draught of this Machine is exhibited in Tab. II. Fig. I. wherein

AAAA represent a Trunk of Timber, with a square Hollow, thro' the Centre of which passes the square Piece of Timber BB.

A Groove on each Side, in which are placed the two Pieces of Iron CC; the Foot of each resting on the Pins DD, that pass thro' the Trunk; the upper Part of the Irons are hooked to an iron Pin at E, which passes thro' the square Piece BB; which Piece is hollowed between H and H, for the Hooks of the Irons CC to pass up and down.

When the Weight F touches the Ground, the two Irons CC sink the Trunk to G, which unhooks them at E; whereupon they fall off, and leave the Trunk at Liberty to float or rise up again to the Surface.

A Machine of these Dimensions, loaded with an iron Ball, F, of 12 Pounds Weight, being let down in
In Water 100 Fathoms deep, will go down to the Bottom, and the Trunk will return in one Minute and three Seconds.

VIII. A Letter from Mr. J. Breintal to Mr. Peter Collinson, F. R. S. containing an Account of what he felt after being bit by a Rattle-Snake.

Philadelphia, Feb. 10. 1746.

I AM much obliged to you for your kind Letter; but you injoin me a sad Task. You must know then, that, on the 2d of last May in the Afternoon, I took a Turn down to the River; and meeting there some Company, we tarried about two Hours.

I hearing a Bell upon the Top of a steep Hill, which I knew to be the Cows of the People where I then quarter'd, and thinking to drive them home, it being almost in a strait Line thither, went right up the Hill; and as it was stony, sometimes I was ready to fall, so saved myself by my Hands, and got safe very near the Top; where either my Foot slipt, or the Stone under it gave Way, and brought me down upon my Knees. I laid my Hand on a broad Stone to stay myself; and, I suppose, the Snake lay on the opposite Side, and might be offended by some Motion of the Stone, so bit my Hand in an Instant, without any Warning or Sight; then slid under the Stones, and founded his Rattles.
