"Nobody came by any Hurt, the People of the House getting away in Time; but all Dickey's* Household-goods are lost, with a Cellar well stocked with Wine and Ale."

Now, Sir, though this Representation be not altogether so accurate, in every Part of the Relation, as we could have wished; yet coming from an Eye-witness, and who happened to observe it from the first Motion, and is esteemed a Person of Fidelity, we thought it might not be unacceptable to the Royal Society, and to you, Sir, and which, if the most learned and worthy President judge proper, you may be pleased to communicate to that Learned and Illustrious Body, with our most humble Services.

XIII. An Examination of Sea-water frozen and melted again, to try what Quantity of Salt is contained in such Ice, made in Hudson's Streights by Capt. Christopher Middleton, F. R. S. at the Request of C. Mortimer, R. S. Secr.

Dr. Hales, in his learned Paper lately read at the Royal Society, wherein he proposes a Method of rendering Sea-water fresh, and wholesome

to drink, mentions a Diversity of Saltness of the Water at the Nore in the Mouth of the Thames, and the Water taken up in the Mediterranean Sea, this containing $\frac{1}{27}$ of Salt, the former $\frac{1}{29}$. Mr. Boyle, in his Observations of the Saltness of the Sea, p. 4. faith, that about Holland the Salt in the Sea-water hath been found to be $\frac{1}{40}$. In the English Chanel, p. 31. he found Sea-water $\frac{1}{45}$ heavier than Conduit-water; and, by immersing a Lump of Sulphur in it, he found the Difference $\frac{1}{53}$; but by Distillation ad siccitatem, p. 33. he found the Salt to be $\frac{1}{30}$, and in another Trial $\frac{1}{37}$. It is certain the Sea differs in Saltness in different Parts: It is, in general, observed, that in hottest Climates the Water is the saltest. At Mosambique Mr. Boyle, ib. p. 29. relates an Instance of a Ship drawing Two Handsbreadth less Water than usual. On the contrary, when Salt-water freezes, it hath been thought to let fall all its Salt; the Ice of Sea-water, and the Water melted from it, tasting fresh, and being good for boiling Meat and Pease in: Capt. Middleton, being in Hudson's Streights in July 1738. took Ice from under the Surface of the Sea, which he melted till he got 40 Quarts of Water, which he evaporated to Dryness, and out of that Quantity had only Six Ounces of Salt, or about $\frac{1}{813}$.
