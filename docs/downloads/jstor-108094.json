F.R.S.\n\nReceived April 6.—Read April 27, 1837.\n\n1. The object of this memoir is to show how the constituent parts of the roots of algebraical equations may be determined, by considering the conditions under which they vanish, and conversely to show the signification of each such constituent part.\n\n2. In equations of degrees higher than the second the same constituent part of the root is found in several places governed by the same radical sign, but affected with the different corresponding roots of unity as multipliers.\n\n3. The root of every equation, of which the coefficients are rational, contains a rational part, for the sum of the roots could not otherwise be rational.\n\nThis rational part, as such, is insusceptible of change in the different roots of the same equation, consequently its value is the coefficient of the second term (with a changed sign) divided by the number of roots, or index of the first term.\n\n4. The supposed evanescence of any of the other constituent parts implies that a relation exists between the roots; if such a relation be expressed by equating a function of the roots to zero, that constituent part will be the product of all such functions, and a numerical factor.\n\n5. The joint evanescence of various constituent parts implies the co-existence of various relations between the roots, and thus an interpretation may be given to each of the constituent parts, riveting the expression of the root in the memory, and beautifully converting the solution of a problem into a condensed enunciation of various theorems.\n\nFor simplicity these principles are first applied to equations of lower degrees.\n\n6. Let us take for example the general quadratic equation\n\n\\[ x^2 + ax + b, \\]\n\nthe two roots of which are represented by \\( x_1, x_2 \\) in the formulæ,\n\n\\[ x_1 = -\\frac{a}{2} + \\sqrt{\\alpha} \\]\n\\[ x_2 = -\\frac{a}{2} - \\sqrt{\\alpha}. \\]\n\nTo find \\( \\alpha \\) suppose \\( \\alpha = 0 \\), a relation is then established between the quantities \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\), viz.\n\n\\[ x_1 - x_2 = 0, \\]\n$x_1 - x_2$ vanishing with $\\alpha$ is a factor of it; and since the roots must be symmetrically involved in $\\alpha$, the other factor is $x_2 - x_1$, whence\n\n$$\\alpha = k (x_1 - x_2)^2,$$\n\nwhere $k$ is simply a number.\n\nPut for $-\\frac{a}{2}$ its expression in terms of the roots, and we thus have\n\n$$x_1 = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + \\frac{x_1 - x_2}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{4k},$$\n\n$$x_2 = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} - \\frac{x_1 - x_2}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{4k},$$\n\nwhence\n\n$$x_1 - x_2 = (x_1 - x_2) \\cdot \\sqrt{4k}, \\text{ or } k = \\frac{1}{4};$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{4} (x_1 - x_2)^2,$$\n\nwhich is a symmetrical function, and therefore easily expressed by the coefficients.\n\n7. From this it follows that $\\alpha = 0$ is the condition that the equation may have two equal roots; but if the proposed quadratic be represented by $\\varphi = 0$, and its derived equation by $\\varphi' = 0$, which is the same as $2x + a = 0$, the condition for two equal roots is obtained by eliminating $x$ between these equations, which by the theory of elimination gives as the sought condition\n\n$$\\varphi'(x_1) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_2) = 0;$$\n\nwe have thus\n\n$$\\alpha = k' \\varphi'(x_1) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_2),$$\n\n$k'$ being numerical.\n\nNow $\\varphi(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2)$, therefore $\\varphi'(x) = (x - x_1) + (x - x_2)$, whence\n\n$$\\varphi'(x_1) = x_1 - x_2, \\quad \\varphi'(x_2) = x_2 - x_1,$$\n\nconsequently $k' = -\\frac{1}{4}$; and converting the sum and product of $x_1, x_2$ into the coefficients, we obtain\n\n$$x_1 = -\\frac{a}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a^2}{4} - b\\right)} \\quad x_2 = -\\frac{a}{2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a^2}{4} - b\\right)}.$$\n\n8. The constituent parts in the roots which have been the objects of investigation were $-\\frac{a}{2}$ and $\\alpha$, and with respect to their evanescence we have the following theorem.\n\nThe vanishing of that part of the root of a quadratic which is under the radical sign implies the existence of two equal roots.\n\nThe vanishing of the other part which is unaffected by that sign signifies that the roots are equal, but with contrary signs.\n\nBy the aid of this theorem we shall be able to find two of the three constituent parts of the roots of a cubic equation.\n9. Let us now extend the same views to equations of the third degree, and let \\( x_1 \\), \\( x_2 \\), \\( x_3 \\) be the three roots of the cubic \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). Put\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{a}{3} + \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha} + \\sqrt[3]{\\beta}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_2 = -\\frac{a}{3} + \\theta \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha} + \\theta^2 \\sqrt[3]{\\beta}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_3 = -\\frac{a}{3} + \\theta^2 \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha} + \\theta \\sqrt[3]{\\beta}.\n\\]\n\nThe numbers \\( \\theta \\), \\( \\theta^2 \\) are the imaginary cube roots of unity, and we may observe that the formulæ for \\( x_3 \\), \\( x_1 \\) differ only from that for \\( x_2 \\) in having \\( \\theta^2 \\), \\( \\theta^3 \\) respectively instead of \\( \\theta \\).\n\n10. The quantities \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), which are obviously similarly involved, are the roots of a quadratic, and of the forms\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\alpha' + \\sqrt{\\alpha''}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\alpha' - \\sqrt{\\alpha''};\n\\]\n\nthe three quantities \\( -\\frac{a}{3}, \\alpha' \\) and \\( \\alpha'' \\) are the constituent parts of the roots of the cubic in the sense in which those words have been used; the first is the same as \\( \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} \\), and the other two can be found from the conditions of their evanescence as follows.\n\n11. Suppose \\( \\alpha'' = 0 \\), the theorem of art. 8. gives us \\( \\alpha = \\beta \\), whence we find \\( x_2 = x_3 \\); now \\( x_2 - x_3 \\) vanishing with \\( \\alpha'' \\) is a factor of it; and the other symmetrical factors are \\( x_3 - x_2 \\), \\( x_1 - x_3 \\), \\( x_3 - x_1 \\), \\( x_1 - x_2 \\), \\( x_2 - x_1 \\), \\( k \\) being a number, we must therefore have\n\n\\[\n\\alpha'' = k (x_1 - x_2)^2 (x_1 - x_3)^2 (x_2 - x_3)^2.\n\\]\n\n12. To find \\( \\alpha' \\) in like manner, suppose \\( \\alpha' = 0 \\) the theorem of art. 8 before referred to, in this case makes \\( \\alpha = -\\beta \\), and the three roots of the cubic accordingly are changed to the following:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_2 = -\\frac{a}{3} + (\\theta - \\theta^2) \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_3 = -\\frac{a}{3} - (\\theta - \\theta^2) \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha};\n\\]\n\nwhence we readily find that \\( 2x_1 = x_2 + x_3 \\), therefore \\( 2x_1 - x_2 - x_3 \\) is a factor of \\( \\alpha' \\), and the other symmetrical factors are \\( 2x_2 - x_1 - x_3 \\), and \\( 2x_3 - x_1 - x_2 \\); hence if \\( k' \\) be a numerical factor\n\n\\[\n\\alpha' = k' (2x_1 - x_2 - x_3) (2x_2 - x_1 - x_3) (2x_3 - x_1 - x_2);\n\\]\n\nthese symmetrical functions can be expressed by the given coefficients of the equation.\n13. The constants $k$, $k'$ may be easily found in various ways, perhaps the simplest means is to suppose $\\alpha' = 0$ to find $k$, and $\\alpha'' = 0$ to find $k'$.\n\nIf we put $x_3 = 0$ and $x_1 = 2 x_1$, we have $\\alpha' = 0$, and $\\alpha'' = 4 k x_1^6$, hence $\\alpha = 2 x_1^3 \\sqrt[3]{k}$, $\\beta = -2 x_1^3 \\sqrt[3]{k}$, and substituting in the formula for $x_2$, we have (since $a = -3 x_1$)\n\n$$2 x_1 = x_1 + x_1 \\theta \\sqrt[3]{2 \\sqrt{k}} - x_1 \\theta^2 \\sqrt[3]{2 \\sqrt{k}}$$\n\nor\n\n$$1 = \\theta (1 - \\theta) \\sqrt[3]{2 \\sqrt{k}},$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$2 \\sqrt{k} = \\frac{1}{(-\\theta)^3} = \\frac{1}{3 (\\theta^2 - \\theta)}$$\n\nand\n\n$$4 k = \\frac{1}{9 (\\theta - 2 + \\theta^2)}$$\n\nbut $1 + \\theta + \\theta^2 = 0$; therefore\n\n$$k = \\frac{-1}{2^2 \\cdot 3^3}.$$\n\n14. In like manner to find $k'$ suppose $x_2 = x_3 = 0$, which makes $\\alpha'' = 0$, and $\\alpha' + 2 k' \\cdot x_1^3$, and $\\alpha = \\beta = \\alpha'$, therefore\n\n$$x_1 = \\frac{x_1}{3} + 2 x_1 \\sqrt[3]{2 k'}$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3} = \\sqrt[3]{2 k'},$$\n\nwhence\n\n$$k' = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^3}.$$\n\n15. The preceding analysis furnishes the following formula,\n\n$$3 x_1 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + \\sqrt[3]{\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2} (2 x_1 - x_2 - x_3) (2 x_2 - x_1 - x_3) (2 x_3 - x_1 - x_2) + \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{-3 (x_1 - x_2)^2 (x_1 - x_3)^2 (x_2 - x_3)^2}\\right\\}}$$\n\n$$+ \\sqrt[3]{\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2} (2 x_1 - x_2 - x_3) (2 x_2 - x_1 - x_3) (2 x_3 - x_1 - x_2) - \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{-3 (x_1 - x_2)^2 (x_1 - x_3)^2 (x_2 - x_3)^2}\\right\\}}$$\n\nthe corresponding formulae for $3 x_2$, $3 x_3$ being obtained by writing $\\theta$ and $\\theta^2$ before the cubic radical signs.\n\nIn consequence of the negative multiplier $-3$ under the sign of square root it is visible that this formula is not arithmetically applicable when the three roots are real and unequal, which is usually termed the irreducible case.\n\n16. The cubic surds in the formula above given are actually extractible, which verifies the solution.\nTo this end let \\(2x_1 - x_2 - x_3 = A\\), and \\(x_2 - x_3 = B\\), then\n\n\\[\n2x_2 - x_1 - x_3 = \\frac{1}{2} (3B - A)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x_3 - x_1 - x_2 = \\frac{1}{2} (-3B - A)\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} (2x_1 - x_2 - x_3) (2x_2 - x_1 - x_3) (2x_3 - x_1 - x_2) = \\frac{1}{8} (A^3 - 9AB^2).\n\\]\n\nAgain\n\n\\[\nx_1 - x_2 = \\frac{1}{2} (A - B)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_1 - x_3 = \\frac{1}{2} (A + B)\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\cdot (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_3)(x_2 - x_3) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{-3}}{8}(A^2B - B^3)\n\\]\n\nthe total quantity under the first cubic surd thus becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} \\{A^3 + 3A^2(B\\sqrt{-3}) + 3A(B\\sqrt{-3})^2 + (B\\sqrt{-3})^3\\},\n\\]\n\nthe cube root of which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\{A + B\\sqrt{-3}\\}\\), and the actual root of the second surd is similarly \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\{A - B\\sqrt{-3}\\}\\). But\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} (A + B\\sqrt{-3}) = x_1 - x_2 \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2} - x_3 \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= x_1 + x_2\\theta^2 + x_3\\theta.\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} (A - B\\sqrt{-3}) = x_1 + x_2\\theta + x_3\\theta;\n\\]\n\nthe formulæ of this solution become then those of Vaudermonde, viz.\n\n\\[\n3x_1 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + (x_1 + x_2\\theta^2 + x_3\\theta) + (x_1 + x_2\\theta + x_3\\theta^2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3x_2 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + (x_1\\theta + x_2 + x_3\\theta^2) + (x_1\\theta^2 + x_2 + x_3\\theta)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3x_3 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + (x_1\\theta^2 + x_2\\theta + x_3) + (x_1\\theta + x_2\\theta^2 + x_3),\n\\]\n\nwhich contain a complete verification.\n\n17. The two constituent parts \\(a'\\alpha''\\) of the roots of a cubic equation have been resolved into factors by observing the relations established between the roots by their evanescence; another mode exists for forming the same quantities by elimination between the proposed equation and its first and second derived equations.\n\nLet the given equation \\(x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) be represented by \\(\\phi(x) = 0\\), and the first derived, viz. \\(3x^2 + 2ax + b = 0\\) by \\(\\phi'(x) = 0\\), the second derived \\(6x + 2a = 0\\) by \\(\\phi''(x) = 0\\).\n18. When $\\alpha'' = 0$ we have seen that the equation $\\varphi(x) = 0$ has two equal roots.\n\nBut when $\\varphi(x) = 0$ has equal roots, is expressed by making the result of eliminating $x$ between $\\varphi(x) = 0$ and $\\varphi'(x) = 0$ to vanish, and by the theory of elimination this result is $\\varphi'(x_1) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_2) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_3)$; hence we have ($h$ being a number),\n\n$$\\alpha'' = h \\varphi'(x_1) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_2) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_3).$$\n\n19. Suppose now the joint evanescence of $\\alpha'$ and $\\alpha''$, the equation has then three equal roots $x_1 = x_2 = x_3$, the system of equations $\\alpha' = 0$ $\\alpha'' = 0$, the first of three dimensions relative to the roots, the second of six, are therefore the two conditions necessary for the existence of three equal roots.\n\nThe results of the elimination of $x$ between $\\varphi(x) = 0$ $\\varphi''(x) = 0$ and $\\varphi(x) = 0$ $\\varphi'(x) = 0$, give also the two conditions for three equal roots of the same dimensions as the above, with which this system is identical, we have thus, $h'$ being numerical,\n\n$$\\alpha' = h' \\varphi''(x_1) \\cdot \\varphi''(x_2) \\cdot \\varphi''(x_3).$$\n\n20. Since\n\n$$\\varphi(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)$$\n\n$$\\varphi'(x) = (x - x_2)(x - x_3) + (x - x_1)(x - x_3) + (x - x_3)(x - x_2)$$\n\n$$\\varphi''(x) = 2(x - x_3) + 2(x - x_2) + 2(x - x_1);$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\\varphi'(x_1) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_2) \\cdot \\varphi'(x_3) = -(x_1 - x_2)^2(x_1 - x_3)^2(x_2 - x_3)^2$$\n\n$$\\varphi''(x_1) \\cdot \\varphi''(x_2) \\cdot \\varphi''(x_3) = 8(2x_1 - x_2 - x_3)(2x_2 - x_1 - x_3)(2x_3 - x_1 - x_2);$$\n\nthe values of $\\alpha'$ $\\alpha''$ are therefore conformable to those before found, and\n\n$$h = -k = \\frac{1}{2^a \\cdot 3^b} \\quad h' = \\frac{k'}{8} = \\frac{1}{2^4 \\cdot 3^3}.$$\n\n21. In the elimination of a quantity between two equations into which that quantity enters rationally, it is in general indifferent which of the two equations is selected that its roots may be substituted for such quantity, for the dimensions of the product is the same whether we substitute the $n$ roots of an equation of $n$ dimensions in one of $m$, or the $m$ roots of the latter in the former of $n$ dimensions, and take the products; these products are not only of the same dimensions but imply the coexistence of the same system of equations, and can only differ from each other by numerical multipliers, when the numerical coefficient in the one differs from that of the other.\n\nIn the present instance, if $\\xi_1$ $\\xi_2$ be the roots of the equation $\\varphi' = 0$, and $X$ that of $\\varphi'' = 0$, the values of $\\alpha'$ $\\alpha''$ may also be expressed in the following form,\n\n$$\\alpha'' = H \\varphi(\\xi_1) \\cdot \\varphi(\\xi_2)$$\n\n$$\\alpha'' = K \\cdot \\varphi(X)$$\n\nthe factors $H$, $K$ being numbers.\n\n22. Now if we observe that by the equation $\\varphi'(\\xi_1) = 0$,\n\n$$\\xi_1^2 = -\\frac{a}{3} \\cdot \\xi_1 - \\frac{b}{3}$$\nand therefore\n\n\\[ \\xi_1^3 = -\\frac{2a}{3} \\cdot \\xi_1^2 - \\frac{b}{3} \\cdot \\xi_1 = \\left( \\frac{4a^3}{9} - \\frac{b}{3} \\right) \\cdot \\xi_1 + \\frac{2ab}{9} \\]\n\nit will follow that \\( \\varphi(\\xi_1) \\) or \\( \\xi_1^3 + a \\xi_1^2 + b \\xi_1 + c \\), is the same as \\( A \\xi_1 + B \\), putting\n\n\\[ A = -\\left( \\frac{2a^3}{9} - \\frac{2b}{3} \\right) \\]\n\\[ B = c - \\frac{ab}{9}. \\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[ \\varphi(\\xi_1) \\cdot \\varphi(\\xi_2) = (A \\xi_1 + B)(A \\xi_2 + B); \\]\n\nand since \\( \\xi_1 \\xi_2 = \\frac{b}{3} \\) and \\( \\xi_1 + \\xi_2 = -\\frac{2a}{3} \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\alpha'' = H \\left( A^2 \\cdot \\frac{b}{3} - \\frac{2a}{3} \\cdot A B + B^2 \\right) \\]\n\\[ = H \\left( c^2 - \\frac{2ab}{3} \\cdot c + \\frac{4a^3}{27} \\cdot c + \\frac{4b^3}{27} - \\frac{a^2b^2}{27} \\right). \\]\n\nAgain since \\( X = -\\frac{a}{3} \\) therefore\n\n\\[ \\alpha' = K \\left( c - \\frac{ab}{3} + \\frac{2a^3}{27} \\right). \\]\n\nSuppose \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to vanish, then \\( \\sqrt{\\alpha'} = c \\sqrt{H}, \\alpha'' = K \\cdot c; \\) therefore\n\n\\[ x_1 = \\sqrt[3]{c \\{ K + \\sqrt{H} \\}} + \\sqrt[3]{c \\{ K - \\sqrt{H} \\}} = \\sqrt[3]{-c}; \\] hence\n\n\\[ k + \\sqrt{H} = -1 K - \\sqrt{H} = 0; \\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[ K = -\\frac{1}{2}, H = \\frac{1}{4}; \\]\n\nthus the transformation is affected from symmetrical functions to given coefficients.\n\n23. Expressions for \\( \\alpha', \\alpha'' \\) having been found by various methods, we have also the following properties with respect to their evanescence,\n\n\\[ x_1 = -\\frac{a}{3} + \\sqrt[3]{(\\alpha' + \\sqrt{\\alpha''})} + \\sqrt[3]{(\\alpha' - \\sqrt{\\alpha''})}. \\]\n\nWhen the quantity \\( (\\alpha'') \\) under the quadratic and cubic radicals vanishes, the proposed equation has two equal roots.\n\nWhen the quantity \\( (\\alpha') \\) under the cubic but not under the quadratic surd vanishes, two of the three differences of the roots are equal, or one root is one half the sum of the other two.\n\nWhen both these quantities \\( (\\alpha', \\alpha'') \\) vanish conjointly, the given equation has three equal roots.\n\nConversely when the proposed has two equal roots the equation of condition is \\( \\alpha'' = 0 \\), when it has three equal roots the two equations of condition are \\( \\alpha' = 0, \\alpha'' = 0. \\)\nWhen the quantity \\(-\\frac{a}{3}\\) in the expression for the root which is unaffected by surds vanishes, one root is equal to the sum of the other two with changed signs.\n\nWhen \\(-\\frac{a}{3}\\) and \\(a''\\) vanish conjointly, two of the roots are each one half of the third with a changed sign.\n\nWhen \\(-\\frac{a}{3}\\) and \\(a'\\) vanish jointly, the equation has two roots equal, but with contrary signs, and the third root is zero.\n\nWhen \\(-\\frac{a}{3}, a', a''\\) all vanish simultaneously, the three roots are equal to each other and to zero.\n\n24. **Biquadratic Equations.**—Let \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\) be the four roots of the equation\n\n\\[x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d,\\]\n\nthe number 4 being composite allows the subdivision of the sums of the roots taken two and two into three pairs, which have rational sums, thus\n\n\\[x_1 + x_2 + \\frac{a}{2} = -(x_3 + x_4 + \\frac{a}{2}),\\]\n\\[(x_1 + x_3 + \\frac{a}{2}) = -(x_2 + x_4 + \\frac{a}{2}),\\]\n\\[x_1 + x_4 + \\frac{a}{2} = -(x_2 + x_3 + \\frac{a}{2}),\\]\n\ntherefore the equation, of which the roots are\n\n\\[x_1 + x_2 + \\frac{a}{2}, x_1 + x_3 + \\frac{a}{2}, x_1 + x_4 + \\frac{a}{2}, -(x_3 + x_4 + \\frac{a}{2}), \\text{ &c.}\\]\n\nis one of six dimensions, but without terms involving the odd powers of the unknown quantity, and therefore these quantities are the square roots of the roots of a cubic equation.

Suppose $\\alpha''' = 0$, then by art. 23 two of the roots of the cubic are equal, or $\\beta = \\gamma$, from whence we have $x_3 = x_4$, therefore $x_3 - x_4$ is a factor of $\\alpha'''$, and forming all the other symmetrical factors, we have\n\n$$\\alpha''' = k (x_1 - x_2)^2 (x_1 - x_3)^2 (x_1 - x_4)^2 (x_2 - x_3)^2 (x_2 - x_4)^2 (x_3 - x_4)^2,$$\n\n$k$ being a numerical multiplier.\n\n26.

It remains to give the value of the constants \\( k, k', k'', k''' \\), which may be easily found by comparison of the above values with the constituent parts of the roots of a biquadratic; they are as follows:\n\n\\[ k = -\\left(\\frac{\\omega-1}{5}\\right)^{60} \\cdot \\frac{24}{3^3} \\]\n\\[ k' = \\left(\\frac{\\omega-1}{5}\\right)^{30} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^4 \\cdot 3^3} \\]\n\\[ k'' = \\left(\\frac{\\omega-1}{5}\\right)^{10} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} \\]\n\\[ k''' = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}; \\]\n\nand the term uninfluenced by surds is \\( \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5}{5} \\).\n\n43. All the constituent parts except the last-mentioned vanish when all the roots are equal, but for their separate evanescence the condition for the equality of roots is insufficient, the requisite conditions are easily seen from the factors of such parts already given; they are of two classes, arising from the different relations of the couples \\((\\omega, \\omega^2), (\\omega, \\omega^3), (\\omega^3, \\omega^4), (\\omega^3, \\omega^4)\\), and of the two couples \\((\\omega^2, \\omega^3), (\\omega, \\omega^4)\\), each member of which contains the same imaginary part with the other, which is not the case with the former couples.\n\n44. I cannot at present, from the pressure of other engagements, pursue these investigations further; if any additional light to the analyst is furnished by the preceding imperfect reflections on a subject so often treated, the author's object will in a great measure be attained; they at least tend to show the imperfection of our\n\nMDCCCXXXVII.\nknowledge with respect to the conditions resulting from elimination, where more than two equations are concerned, and they exhibit in the higher powers relations between pairs of roots which have not been as yet expressed, even by the differential calculus.\n\nLondon, April 1, 1837.",
