By Mr. John Read; communicated by R. H. A. Bennet, Esq. F. R. S.\n\nRead April 14, 1791.\n\nA DESCRIPTION of the instrument for collecting atmospheric electricity, used in the following journal.\n\nTab. V. represents the apparatus. AA is a round deal rod, 20 feet long, 2 inches diameter at the lower, and one inch at the upper end. Into the lower end of it is cemented a solid glass pillar B, 22 inches long; the lower end of the glass stands in a hole made for it in a pedestal of wood C, which slips on the fore-part of an iron bracket D, which is driven into the wall, and supports the whole. About 13 feet above the bracket D, is fixed to the wall a strong arm of wood E, which holds perpendicularly a strong glass tube F, through which the rod is slid gently upwards, till the glass pillar B may be lowered into the hole made for it in C. It is thus fixed, and stands 12 inches from the wall. The tube F is of sufficient width to admit a case of cork, which is fastened in the inside of it, at the part where the tube is sustained by the arm of wood E, so that the rod, when bent by the wind, cannot touch the tube or break it. The upper extremity of the rod is terminated by several sharp-pointed wires G. Two of them are\nof copper, each one-eighth of an inch thick; and, in order to stiffen the rod, as well as conduct more readily the electric fluid, one of those wires is twisted round the rod to the right hand, and the other to the left, as low down as the brass collar at the vertex of the lower funnel H, to which they are foldered, in order to render their contact perfect. The tin funnels HH serve to defend the glasses B and F from the weather, which glasses are also covered with sealing-wax to render their insulation more perfect. At a convenient height from the floor, a hole is bored through the wall at I. This hole receives a glass tube covered with sealing-wax, through which a strong brass wire proceeding from the rod is conveyed into the room, where just at the end of the glass tube it passes through a two-inch brass ball L, and proceeding a little farther, keeps suspended at its extremity a pith ball electrometer K, so that the electrometer may be about twelve inches distant from the wall. On the outside of the wall there is a wooden box M, to keep that end of the glass tube dry.\n\nAt two inches distance of the above-mentioned brass ball L, a bell N is supported by a strong wire, which passing through another hole made in the wall, is made to communicate, by means of a good metallic continuation R, with the moist ground adjoining to the house. A brass ball, three-tenths of an inch in diameter, is suspended between the bell N and ball L, by a silk thread fastened to a nail O. This ball serves for a clapper, by striking between the ball and bell, when the electrical charge of the rod is sufficiently strong.\n\nP is a small table fixed to the wall under the bell and ball, at a convenient height above the floor, upon which Leyden bottles and other apparatus are occasionally placed. Any person versed in the science of electricity, will easily understand that this apparatus...\napparatus is calculated to shew the various degrees of atmospheric electricity, and at the same time to avoid the pernicious effects which may be occasioned by thunder-storms, or in short by any great quantity of electricity in the atmosphere.\n\nThe whole perpendicular height of both parts taken together, from the moist earth to the uppermost point at the top of the rod, is 52 feet.\n\nFinding, however, that, notwithstanding all the precaution I had taken to procure a good insulation, the moist vapour of the atmosphere, fixing upon the insulating parts of the apparatus, rendered it imperfect in moist weather; I have lately (15th of Sept. 1790) altered the situation of the same rod, so that all the insulating parts are now within the roof of the house. This I have effected by a hole through the roof of my house; by which means I now obtain a considerably more constant electricity; which, however, must not be solely attributed to the superiority of my present mode of insulating, but to the rod's being also elevated to the additional height of nine feet; so that I consider its pointed part to be at present 61 feet above the moist earth.\n\nThis improvement of the apparatus, having been made after the conclusion of this journal, will be particularly described in the next, which I am now carefully continuing.\n\nIt will be necessary just to mention the method I have pursued in forming the journal of atmospheric electricity. This has been principally by means of the signs exhibited by the pith balls K, connected with the rod. When I find these closed, and not attracted by my finger, I then write no signs of electricity. When attracted on the approach of my finger, yet not sufficiently charged to repel each other, I write weak signs of the fluid. When I find the balls open, and, on the approach of excited glass, the balls close, I write they are electrified posi-\ntively; but, if the balls open wider, I write they are electrified negatively; and the reverse when I use sealing-wax. When the balls diverge one inch and upwards, visible sparks may be drawn at the brass ball L. When sparks are said to have been perceived in any observation, I have generally on that account omitted to note the variable quantities of divergency in the pith balls. Their utmost limit of regular divergency seems to be about five or near six inches; above that they are unsteady and disorderly. The pith balls are near two-tenths of an inch in diameter, suspended by very fine flaxen threads (in the state it is in from the heckle) five inches long. When I mention the distance of the balls in tenths of an inch, it is to be understood as nearly so as my eye can determine.\n\nThis apparatus requires a constant attention, especially during a disturbed state of the atmosphere. From the room in which the apparatus is placed I am seldom absent one hour, excepting the time of sleep; but, when I leave it, the last thing I do at night is to examine the state of the electricity, and, if I find the rod unelectrified, I then place the Leyden bottle on the table P, with its knob nearly in contact with the ball L. The next morning, if I find this bottle charged, I write the kind of electricity it is charged with against the day in the journal, and add, by the night bottle.\n\nIt is presumed, that the table is sufficiently obvious. The two columns for positive and negative electricity are used only for the first observation of each day. I use Fahrenheit's thermometer, suspended on the north outside of a bow window. The time of making the observation with it, and the barometer, and also of the direction of the wind, has usually been about nine o'clock in the morning.\n\nLastly, it may be useful to observe, that I have always found the lower though uninsulated part of the apparatus (viz.\nthe metallic connection of the bell N with the moist earth) to be in a contrary state of electricity to the upper and insulated part, where the pith balls K are suspended. See the 22d of Aug.\n\nHaving made a memorandum of the several thunderstorms which have happened in divers parts of this island, according to the information by letters, and from newspapers, I thought it useful to insert them in this journal, in order to shew whether some contemporaneous appearances in my apparatus might not be attributed to them. This seems evidently to have been the case on the 3d of September.\n\n| Days | Wind | Barom. | Ther. | Sparks | Pof. | Neg. | May 9, 1789 |\n|------|------|--------|-------|--------|-----|------|-------------|\n| May 9 | NW   | 30.    | 63    | o      | neg.| Balls open about three-tenths of an inch. |\n| 10    | SW   | 30.15  | 60    | o      | neg.| But very weak. |\n| 11    | E    | 30.24  | 61    | o      | neg.| Barely sufficient to separate the balls. |\n| 12    | E    | 29.91  | 60    | small  | neg.| The first day I have had visible sparks; weather cloudy, but fair. |\n| 13    | E    | 29.91  | 61    | strong | pof.| The weather in the forenoon a little hazy; in the afternoon a thick fog; four o'clock a little rain fell; the rod now became highly electrified positively; the bell rang briskly.

But very weak.\n\nA very cloudy morning, though at too great a height for my rod; but in the afternoon the clouds approached much nearer, and the rod became charged pretty strongly positive, which continued about one hour and a quarter. I charged some Leyden bottles with the fluid, some positive, others negative, for there were four gradual changes of the electricity.\n\nBalls open half an inch.\n\nNine o'clock A.M. a heavy shower of rain fell, the rod became strongly charged with negative electricity, all the time the shower lasted, which was short and sudden. One hour afterwards, the electricity changed to a strong positive, the bell suddenly began to ring, and continued to do so five minutes; the pith balls then close slowly, and open negative, and continued weakly to the rest of the day. At Edinburgh, some lightning and thunder this day.\n\nJune 1 SW 29.71 53 strong pol. — A cloudy showery morning. The electric charge in rod was most beautiful this day. In about six hours time I observed seven changes of the electricity; five of those changes were gradual. The balls opened from 3 to 4 inches, and remained so from 15 to 20 minutes each opening, then gradually closed; the other two charged slowly, but closed very quick.\n| Days | Wind | Barom. | Ther.

The rod was pretty strongly electrified full seven hours to-day, the rest of the day but weakly so. There were 12 changes of the electricity, all gradual, except one, which was instantaneous; the balls sometimes exhibited a waving motion, and sometimes sudden jerks. There were several showers of rain, and two of hail; during the fall of hail, the rod was most powerfully electrified, the bell rang very strongly; the effects and appearances were so awful, that I kept at a good distance from the rod. A great deal of lightning on the east side of Kent and Essex this day. |\n| 5    | NW   | 29.52  | 53           | o   | neg. |\n| 6    | W    | 29.78  | 53           | small | neg. |\n|      |      |        |              |     | — Balls open half an inch. |\n|      |      |        |              |     | — A.M. and P.M. positive; there were small sparks emitted from the brass ball L, and the pith balls continued closing and opening many times, without any change of kind, for full two hours. |\n| 7    | NW   | 29.92  | 52           | o   | neg. |\n| 8    | NW   | 30.18  | 50           | o   | neg. |\n| 9    | NW   | 30.12  | 57           | o   | neg. |\n| 10   | NW   | 30.25  | 56           | o   | — |\n| 11   | NW   | 30.12  | 55           | o   | — |\n| 12   | E    | 30.25  | 56           | o   | pof. |\n| 13   | E    | 30.28  | 54           | o   | pof. |\n| 14   | NE   | 30.19  | 51           | o   | neg. |\n| 15   | E    | 30.4   | 55           | o   | neg. |\n| 16   | E    | 29.90  | 60           | o   | neg. |\n| 17   | S    | 29.81  | 62           | strong | pof. |\n|      |      |        |              |     | — Ten o'clock A.M. a sudden shower of rain fell, by which the rod became highly electrified positively, and continued to emit small sparks at the ball L, long after the shower was over, without any change of the electricity. |\n\nJune\n| Days | Winds | Barom. | Ther. | Sparks | Pof. | Neg. |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|--------|-----|-----|\n| June 18 | SE | 29.89 | 60 | small | pos. | — |\n| 19 | SW | 29.83 | 56 | o | neg. | — |\n| 20 | SW | 29.65 | 63 | o | — | — |\n| 21 | SW | 29.71 | 59 | small | neg. | — |\n\nThe weather showery; the rod pretty well electrified.\n\nBalls open six-tenths of an inch.\n\nWeak signs; balls not open.\n\nThis morning several heavy clouds passed over, coming from the SW, by which the rod became moderately electrified negatively. Some rain fell, which increased the electrical charge. But, in the afternoon, the wind and clouds put on a more ominous appearance; near five o'clock, began a storm of wind, rain, lightning, and thunder; but the main weight of the storm did not come near my rod. Its dire effects must be east of London: nevertheless, I had those usual beautiful appearances which attend a strong charge in the rod. The storm lasted one full hour, during which time there were five successive changes of the electricity, viz. four gradual ones, attended with sudden jerks or starts, which often diminished the divergency of the pith balls from 4 inches to 2 inches or less. After those jerks the pith balls recovered their former degree of divergency, sometimes suddenly, and at other times slowly. The other change happened instantaneously, the pith balls collapsing and opening so quickly, that the eye could barely see their motion. There were two other instantaneous closings and openings of the balls, without a change of the electricity. Much lightning at Gravesend today.\n\nThe rod was in charge all day.\n\nMost of the forenoon. Afternoon some rain fell, and the rod became electrified negatively, and ended positively.\n\nJune\n| Days | Wind | Barom. | Ther. | Sparks | Pos. | Neg. |\n|------|------|--------|-------|--------|------|------|\n| June 25 | NW | 29.64 | 55 | strong | — | neg. |\n|       |      |        |      |        |      | A very thick cloudy morning.

Except some small intervals, the rod has been strongly electrified all this day. The bell once rang briskly for a few minutes, then suddenly stopped its ringing; the pith balls closed and opened negatively, and continued so till a little after eight o'clock P.M. when they changed to positive. At Liverpool, this day, a tremendous storm of lightning, thunder, hail, and rain. |\n| 28    | W   | 29.70 | 50 | strong | — | neg. |\n|       |      |        |      |        |      | A very cold morning and showery, the drops of rain were very large. The rod has been very powerfully electrified near twelve hours this day, during which time there happened eleven changes of the electricity, all gradual but one. The balls often exhibited a waving pendulous motion, without any diminution in their divergency. There were also a few of those jerks before noticed on the 21st instant. The bell rang briskly. There was no change of the electricity. |\n| 29    | W   | 29.90 | 51 | strong | — | neg. |\n| 30    | NW  | 30.10 | 53 | o      | pos. | — |\n|       |      |        |      |        |      | Nearly all day.

Sometimes the balls were affected with a jerking, at others a waving, motion. The wind now shifted to the SE, and a heavy rain soon came on; the electricity now changed to positive, and the bell now rings briskly; every appearance (both within and without the room) was tremendously awful. I therefore seated myself upon a large inflated stool, where I could with safety observe the apparatus. A Leyden bottle was undefignedly placed with its brass knob near to the brass...\n| Days | Wind | Barom. | Ther. | Sparks | Pos. | Neg. |\n|------|------|--------|-------|--------|------|------|\n|      |      | Inches |       |        |      |      |\n\nball L. This bottle charged and spontaneously discharged almost as quick as I could notice them; and at the same time there was a continual flashing of dense sparks between the bell and brass ball L. These very grand appearances only lasted ten minutes, and the scene was terminated by a clap of thunder; but the storm, and its effects on the rod, lasted near two hours. I saw no lightning but what was in the apparatus. There were nine gradual changes of the electricity, from negative to positive, &c.\n\nI had purposely placed a large glass bowl, upon an insulated table, in the open air, to catch the falling electrified rain. As soon as the bottom of the bowl was well covered with the rain water of the above storm, to my great satisfaction, a pair of linen threads I had placed for the purpose diverged near two inches; the water remained electrified near ten minutes after it was taken into the house.\n\nP.M. a little rain fell, and the electricity changed to positive. At Edinburgh and Banff, this day, there was much lightning and thunder.\n\nA very strong electricity in the rod all the forenoon. 12 o'clock some rain fell, on which the rod became highly charged positively, the bell rang weakly for a long time, it then stopped, and the balls closed, and opened negative, and continued so full three hours.

This storm of wind (for there was but little rain) carried the huge black clouds to the NW, for there I saw abundance of red lightning a little above the horizon, and I once heard a rumbling of thunder. The rod before the storm was positive, but by it was changed to negative, and continued so during the whole time.

I find this method to be a good substitute in damp weather. The rod is about the length and strength of a fishing-rod, with plenty of small wire twined round it.\n| Days | Wind | Barom. | Ther. | Sparks | Pos. | Neg. |\n|------|------|--------|-------|--------|------|------|\n| Nov.16 | SW   | 29.43  | 43    | o      | —    | —    |\n|       | S    | 29.54  | 47    | small  | neg. | —    |\n| 18    | S    | 29.51  | 40    | o      | pof. | —    |\n| 19    | S    | 29.69  | 43    | o      | pof. | —    |\n| 20    | W    | 29.65  | 47    | o      | por. | —    |\n| 21    | NW   | 29.86  | 44    | o      | neg. | —    |\n| 22    | N    | 29.89  | 44    | o      | —    | —    |\n| 23    | NE   | 30.12  | 42    | o      | —    | —    |\n| 24    | NE   | 30.29  | 41    | small  | pof. | —    |\n| 25    | N    | 30.20  | 37    | o      | pof. | —    |\n| 26    | N    | 30.30  | 37    | small  | pof. | —    |\n| 27    | SE   | 30.45  | 30    | o      | neg. | —    |\n| 28    | W    | 30.43  | 33    | o      | pof. | —    |\n| 29    | NW   | 30.30  | 35    | small  | pof. | —    |\n| Dec.1 | SE   | 29.71  | 38    | o      | —    | —    |\n| 2     | S    | 29.75  | 50    | o      | pof. | —    |\n| 3     | S    | 29.90  | 39    | strong | pof. | —    |\n\nhas prevailed for many days; and there have been six hours drizzling rain today, which must lessen the exactness of the insulation of the rod, and air also.\n\nWeak signs; balls not open.\n\nA.M. small sparks were in the rod, the greatest part of this day.\n\nA.M. by means of a fog.\n\nA.M. by the night bottle, which I found well charged.\n\nWeak signs only.\n\nNo signs.

From often considering this apparently whimsical changeableness in nature, I was at length induced to suspect, what indeed was afterwards confirmed by actual experiment, viz. that some of these changes are only apparent, and not real, they being occasioned not by the actual communication of a different sort of electricity, but merely by the action of electrical atmospheres; thus, when an electrified cloud comes within a certain distance of the rod, and before it comes near enough to impart to it some of its own electricity, the electrical atmosphere of the former, agreeable to the well known laws of electricity, will disturb the electric fluid naturally belonging to the rod, and will consequently occasion several apparent changes in the electrometer, which changes an unexperienced observer would attribute entirely to the change of electricity in the clouds.\n\nThis observation was evidently confirmed by the phenomena observed on the 31st of August; and thence it appears, that the real number of changes from positive to negative, or from negative to positive electricity, cannot be so great as it is shewn by the electrometer affixed to the rod.\n\nI cannot help lamenting with Signor Beccaria, that there are so few high pointed rods erected to ascertain the electrical state of the earth and atmosphere at all times; but more particularly during thunder storms. If there had been pointed rods, for instance, at Whitehaven and Lancaster on the 6th of October, and well attended to at the time of the storm of lightning and thunder, which happened at both places nearly at the same time, it would then have been known, whether the apparatus might not be positive at one place when it is negative at the other.\n",
