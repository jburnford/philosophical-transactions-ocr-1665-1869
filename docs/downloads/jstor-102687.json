S.\n\nIn the Sheep's Kidney, which was ordered at a late Meeting of the Society, to be set aside for me to examine, I found a large whitish body, inclining to yellow, and ting'd with red, as it lay under the Membrane of the Kidney, vid. Tab. I. Fig. 1.A. This was very hard, as is usual in Animal Petrifications, 2 thirds of it lay hid within the substance of the Kidney: It was inclosed with a thick hard Membrane, that could not easily be separated from it, even with a Needle fixt in the end of a Stick. The Branches of the Emulgent Veins and Arteries, lay between it and the Pelvis of the Kidney; all which Vessels were somewhat press'd by this petrified Body. As I was picking off its thick strong Membranous Inclosures, I found the Needle slip into a cavity at an Aperture Fig. II. By this I was inform'd (of what I must confess, before I had no suspicion of) that this hard and heavy Petrified Body was hollow, whereupon I thought of dividing it with a Saw, but finding a Membranous Interstice in it, Fig 2. B. I pull'd it asunder, as express Fig. III. and found its inside divided by many Petrified Cells C. of irregular Figures, and fill'd with Hydatides, some of which are represented at D.\n\nThis uncommon appearance (at least to me) of a Petrified Crust inclosing Hydatides, I thought deserv'd the Figures annext.\n\nTab.

The Petrified Body as it appear'd in it before dissection.\nFig. II.\nThe inferior Surface of the same Petrifyed Body, after\nthe Membrane that inclosed it was taken off.\na The Hole by which it was discover'd to be hollow.\nB.

Microscopical Observations on the Structure of the\nSpleen, and the Proboscis of Fleas. By Mr\nAnthony Van Leeuwenhoek, F. R. S.\n\nDelft, June 1. 1706.\n\nAmongst other things it has been observed, that the\nSpleen is compos'd of a spungy sort of Flesh:\nAnd having examined the Spleens of several Sheep,\nI found that the many Fibrous parts, of which it generally\nconsists, and which many suppose to be Arteries and\nVeins, are in reality no Veins, but are united to, and\ndraw their Nourishment from the Membranes in which\nthey are radicated, and spread themselves into many\nBranches, and join with the Fibrous parts, which likewise\nappear with Roots and Branches growing out of\nthe opposite Membrane, that I could not forbear viewing\nthem with astonishment; imagining that all the innumerable\nfibrous parts were constituted to no other end,\nthan to protrude the Blood which is conveyed into them\nby the Arteries; which Blood in great quantities is contain'd in the Veins, as may appear in great measure in those Veins",
