  "text": "After this discourse, he examins what is related of a certain Spice, called Pimienta di Cipapa, which Cipapa is a province of Guatemala in New Spain; and esteems that Spice to be the same with what Hernandez describes under the name of Xocoxochitle, or Pepe di Tavasco: which by his description seems to be the very same with our Jamaica-pepper, it having those several tafts of Cloves, Pepper, Cinamon, Ginger. Mean time the virtue, for which it is by writers commended, against the Epilepsy and the Guta Serena, he faith he could never find in it, though he acknowledg it to be a good Cephalic, and very Stomachical.\n\nNext, he speaks of the praises given to China-fennel against many infirmities, though he found it little better than the European Fennel, Annis, and Cumin. What Ximenes relates of the chips of Sassafras, that, being kept 7 or 8 days in Sea-water, they make it fresh and potable, he was not so happy to find true, though he kept Sassafras thin sliced, in considerable quantity, infused 20 days in a small proportion of Sea-water. What is written of the Root John Lopez Pineiro, growing in Zanguebar in Africa, and of the Root Della Manique, both commended for their virtue of Infallibly curing Tertians and Quartans, and the bitings and stings of venomous animals, he had neither the good fortune to discover. Further, what is recorded of the shrub of Cheggio, a lactescent plant, found in Cambaja, that the knobs and beards of it, that look Nord-ward, are only Anti-apoplectical, but those that look South-ward, are so far from being endow'd with that virtue, that they are poisonous and deadly; he could not find to answer his Tryals: Neither could he find any great matter in the celebrated wood of Calamba, nor the Vanillas, nor the wood of Labor and Solor. But he must acknowledge the virtue of the Bark of the Peruvian Tree in Guajachil, known by the name of China di China, curing Quartans and all sorts of Tertians. He wisheth, it were as true, what is recorded in the praise of those two Herbs of China, called Pusin and Gudfeng, whereof the former is said to render men Immortal, the other, to preserve them always in good health.\n\nHe cannot believe what Martinius in his Atlas relates of certain Fiery Pits in China, able to dress any meat in them, and uncapable to consume wood: Nor what is written of the two Rivers, Ghienno and Jo, in the province of Xensi, the waters of which are said to be so pure and light, that the lightest straw sinks in them: Nor that the Leaves of certain Trees are metamorphos'd into Swallows; nor lastly, that in the Seas of China there are certain scaly Fishes of a Saffron-colour, which in winter live in the water, but in spring cast their scales, get feathers and wings, and so fly a shore into the woods, and their live all summer and autumn, but then return to their former shape and betake themselves again to the habitation of the Sea.\n\nErrata let us un-corrected in N. 90.\nIn the Dedication p.ult.1.8. for Rhine r.
