II. An Extract of a Letter from Mr. William Stevenson to Benj. Hoadly, M.D. F.R.S. Containing an Account of an Observation of an Eclipse of the Moon, on July 29, 1729, made in Barbados by Mr. Stevenson's Brother.

He took care to regulate a very good Clock, and brought it to true Time about 14 Days before the Eclipse. On the Day it happened, he saw the Sun set, and found the Clock right, according to the mean Time, Refraction allowed. At the Beginning of the Eclipse, the Moon was clouded. At 7 H. 18 M. (in the Evening) apparent Time, he saw the Moon 2 Digits Eclipsed, about 30 Degr.
to the left of its Nadir-Point. At 8 H. 11 M. she
totally immersed into the Earth's Shadow, about
30 Degr. to the right Hand of her Vertical Point.
At 9 H. 51 M. she emerged out of the Shadow,
79 or 80 Degr. to the left of her Nadir-Point. At
10 H. 50 M. the Eclipse ended, 88 Degr. to the
right of her Vertical Point. In this, and all the
other Observations he made of both Solar and Lunar
Eclipses, during several Years he has been in Barba-
dos, he found that they always happened 10 Mi-
nutes sooner than his Computation. Whence he con-
cludes, that that Island lies 2 Degr. and a Half
more Westerly than is generally supposed.

TAKE Leaves of Trees or other Vegetables, that
are somewhat substantial and tough, and have
woody Fibres; as for Instance, Leaves of Orange
Trees, of Lemon, Jasmin, Laurel, Rose-Trees, of
Cherry, Apricock, Peach, Plum, Apple, Pear, and
Trees of Poplar, Pine, Oak, &c.

There are many sorts of Leaves that have no such
woody Fibres or Veins; as for Instance, Vine and
Lime-Tree Leaves.
