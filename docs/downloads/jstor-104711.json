  "text": "III.\n\nAn Account of the same, by Jo. Freeman Esq; F. R. S.\n\nRead Feb. 8. 1749-50.\n\nAs I passed thro' the Mews To-day, a little before 1 o'Clock, I felt a Shock like an Earthquake, and I thought I heard a hollow deep Noise. Several Women thereabouts came running out of their Houses much terrified.\n\nAt Leicester-House they were apprehensive the Foundation was giving Way, and were going to send immediately for the Surveyor.\n\nAll the Way in my Return home, I saw many Groups of People together, and discoursing upon this Shock that had just happen'd; some imagining it was occasion'd by some Houses being blown up in Gold-Lane, where there was a great Fire, and others from some Powder-Mills blowing up; the same thing having been observed about 9 Years ago, from the like Accident at the Mills at Hounslow. If neither of these Causes appear, it can be no other than an Earthquake.\n\nIV.\n\nAn Account of the same, by William Fauquier Esq; F. R. S.\n\nRead Feb. 15. 1749-50.\n\nOn Thursday the 8th of February, 1749-50, at about half an Hour after 12, as I was sitting reading with one Elbow on\non the Table, on the Ground-Floor, in my House at Eltham in Kent, I felt two Shocks from East to West, which I immediately thought was an Earthquake, as I had felt something like it once at Naples; and was confirm'd in my Opinion, by my Wife's running down-stairs frighted, and declar'd it was an Earthquake, she having felt one in the West-Indies. She was in the Room over me, in which Room there was China standing on a Cabinet, which, she says, shook in such a manner that she expected it to fall. My Children, who were in the Room over her, seem to have felt it stronger, as they say, they apprehended a Chest of Drawers in their Room was falling. The Servants that were in the Kitchen, which has no Room under it, seem to have felt but little of it. One that was writing says he felt the Dresser move, and the Wall, but thought it was only the Shutting of a Door. Other Servants in the same Room felt nothing at all of it. My Gardener, who was at Work in the Garden, felt nothing of it.\n\nThe Wind was at S.W. and had been high in the Night and Morning, but was very much abated; and after this, for some time, it was quite calm; which I believe it is generally observ'd to be, in those Countries where Earthquakes are more frequent. A Flight of Pigeons I have, seem'd to be much frighten'd.\n\nEltham is about 8 Miles S.S.E. from London-Bridge, and stands on a Hill.\n\nThis Account was written before I had heard anything from London.",
