S.\n\nRead May 3, 1781.\n\nDEAR SIR,\n\nThe appearance of the soil which fell under my own inspection, on opening a well at Hanby, the seat of Sir C. Buck, in Lenton parish, Lincolnshire, being, as far as I can recollect, quite singular, I hope you will not think this account of it unworthy the attention of the Society.\n\nThe spot on which the well was sunk is nearly on a level with Lincoln Heath, and of course high ground compared with the fen, which is distant from it above six miles. The soil was uniformly a blue clay, in parts rather inclining to a shaly structure, and contained many casts of tellinae, a very little pyrites, and some few small, but very elegant, belemnites. These are all the usual fossils of clay; but what I think without example is, that through the whole mass of clay were interspersed nodules of pure chalk, evidently rounded by long attrition, and of all sizes from that of a pea to a child's head.\n\nThey lay in no sort of order that I could find. How deep this appearance might have continued I cannot determine, but no water having been found at the depth of thirty feet, the trial\ntrial was given up, as the expense would have exceeded the advantage proposed. A specimen of the chalk is herewith exhibited to the Society.\n\nI must add, that in all the environs there is not the least trace of chalk in any form whatever that I could discover or hear of.\n\nI am, &c.",
