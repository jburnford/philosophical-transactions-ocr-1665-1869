An Account of a Quadruped brought from Bengal, and now to be seen in London: Presented by James Parsons, M.D. & F.R.S.\n\nRead June 27. Being always desirous of laying before this Learned Society whatsoever appears to me new and curious, I embraced the present Opportunity of viewing and describing this Creature, which I cannot find mentioned by any Natural Historian, nor any Figure exhibited, in the least, like it. Nor is it indeed to be wonder'd at, since the Beast was brought to Bengal, from a very remote Part of the Mogul's Dominions; insomuch that no Person at Bengal had the least Knowledge of him.\n\nThe only Hint that seems to point at this Creature, is that mentioned by John Albert de Mandelstoe, in his Voyages thro' the Indies, which are published in Harris's Complete Collection of Voyages and Travels, No. 52. p. 775. where he says, that, among the Horses in the Stables of the Viceroy of Goa, he saw \"a Beast called a Biggel, a Creature much about the Colour and Bigness of a Rain-deer: Its Head like that of a Horse; its Main like\n\"that of an Ass, with black cloven Feet, and two\nblack Horns on his Head.\"\n\nThis is the Whole of his Account, which is so\nimperfect, that it can hardly be thought absolutely\nto mean this very Beast before us. The following\nDescription and Drawing I hope will be found pretty\nexact; and may serve to shew with which Genus of\nQuadrupeds he may be classed, and, consequently,\nwhat proper Name may be given him; which I sub-\nmit to this learned Society to determine.\n\nThe Creature is a Male, having the Penis and\nTesticles like those of a Deer; but, as the Penis does\nnot come very forward, it cannot be seen in a side\nView of the Animal.\n\nThe Head is formed like that of a Deer, with a\nrhomboidal Spot of black Hair on his Forehead; his\nEars are dark without, and yellowish within, with\ndark Spots toward their Edges; and the Horns rise\nabout seven Inches high, bending forwards; which\nis very particular, because those of all other horned\nAnimals are directed sideways or backward, except\nthe Brow-Antlers of some Kinds of Deer. He keeps\nhis Ears in continual Motion, which is an Action com-\nmon with Deer, and butts with his Horns as they do.\nHis Eyes are black and lively, and the Rictus Oris is\nlong.\n\nHis Neck bends forward like the Deer Kind, but\nis thick and strong, somewhat resembling that of a\nMale Deer in rutting Time. His Mane is thin of\nHair like that of an Ass, and on the convex Part of\nhis Neck forward he has a Tuft of black Hair.\n\nHis Shoulders are thick, and his Breast pretty broad\nand strong, from which a Piece of loose Skin hangs\nlike the Dewlap of a Cow.\nHis Legs are slender, with cloven Hoofs like those of a Deer.\n\nHis Back rises, directly over his Shoulder, pretty high, upon which the Mane, continued from his Neck, ends in a Tuft of Hair.\n\nFrom the Back of this Bunch or Rising, his posterior Parts resemble those of an Ass, having a Tail like that of the Ass, only it is flat on the Side next the Animal, and convex on the Back. It is about two-and-twenty Inches long, and ends with some long Hairs.\n\nHe is of a light Ash-Colour, having a smooth Coat of short Hairs, which grow darker, inclining towards a black, upon some Parts of his Limbs. He has some White under his Belly towards his Breast, and under his Tail, with white Testicles.\n\nHe feeds on Hay, Grass, or any kind of Greens; and, being tried whether he would eat raw Flesh, refused it. His Keeper says, when he lies down he chews the Cud; and his Excrements are like those of a Deer.\n\nHe is about twelve Hands high to the Top of the Bunch in his Back.\n\nHis Keeper says, he never lies down on either Side, but directly upon his Limbs like the Camel, and that he rises as suddenly as that Beast.\n\nThere is something very particular in his Voice, which imitates the creaking Noise of a Child’s Rattle, or the Croaking of some Birds, rather than the Voice of any Quadruped except the Deer, who, think, exhibits something like it in rutting Time.\n\nSee a Print done from the Drawing I made of this Beast, Tab. III. Fig. 9.",
