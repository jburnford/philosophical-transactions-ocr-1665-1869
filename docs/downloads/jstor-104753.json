S.\n\nRead June 21. At a Pot-house belonging to Mr. Oad in Gravel-Lane, a large Part of the Roof, containing near two Square, was entirely thrown down by the last Earthquake, March 8. 1750. and several Fishermen, then at Work, imagined a Porpoise, or some other large Fish, had risen under their Boat.\n\nXLVI.\n\nExtract of Letter a from Dr. Mackenzie to Dr. Mead F. R. S. concerning Earthquakes at Smyrna.\n\nConstantinople, May 23 1750.\n\nRead July 5. I observe, Sir, in Mr. Touchit's Journal, that a certain ingenious Gentleman would not allow the last Shock of an Earthquake in London to be an Earthquake, because it was not central; but rather calls it an Airquake, because it was lateral. I have felt many Shocks, since I have been in this Country; particularly in Smyrna 1739. when,\nwhen, after the great Shock upon the 24th of March, there were some Shocks every Day for a Month; so that few or none went into Houses before the latter End of April: When I had time enough to observe their Motion, which was regularly periodic, or about the same Hour every Day. But I must differ from this unknown Gentleman's Opinion so far as to say, that every one of those Shocks was lateral, moving from the South to the North; and, as near as I could judge, the Motions formed acute Angles, somewhat resembling the Motion of Lightning.\n\nMordach Mackenzie.\n\nXLVII.\n\nPart of a Letter from William Folkes, Esq; F. R. S. to his Brother the President, concerning a Shock of an Earthquake felt at Newton in Northamptonshire, on Sunday, September 30. 1750.\n\nDear Brother,\n\nRead Oct. 25. On Sunday last, rather before One, whilst we were at Church, we had an Earthquake here. The Noise, to the best of my Judgment, continued near a Minute; but was not so loud as either of those I heard at London. Several of the Congregation perceived the Ground tremble; but I cannot say I did. It is said to have been more violent in several Places in the Neighbourhood than here; but this I much question. Also the Day",
