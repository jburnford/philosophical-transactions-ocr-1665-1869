ERRATUM.

At page 98 of the Volume for 1855, in Archdeacon Pratt's paper "On the Attraction of the Himalayas on the Plumb-Line in India," lines 7 and 5 from the bottom, read

\[ a = -0.0019203 + 0.0059576 u - 0.0014564 v \]

and

\[ = a(0.9980797 + 0.0059576 u - 0.0014564 v). \]

This correction affects none of the results of the paper.
