  "text": "An Account of an old Earthen Vessel, lately found near York.\n\nThis Earthen Vessel describd Fig. 2. suppos'd by some to be an urn, by others to be a Flowerpot, was found lately at the Brickilns without Bowthant Bar, near York: the Clay of this Vessel is of the Colour of Halifax Clay when burnt; the Potters part is well perform'd; the Face being bossed from within, with the Finger, when upon the Wheel; and some streaks of Red paint, about the curls of the Hair, and Ey-brows; and two Red threads about the Neck: on the back-side of the Vessel, a Leaf is drawn in Red, which is still very fresh; but no Glazing, neither upon the Clay nor Red colour; the Face upon the Vessel is as large as that of a middle-sized Woman: the Vessel itself is preserv'd in the Museum Ashmoleanum at Oxford.",
