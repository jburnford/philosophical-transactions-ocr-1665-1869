An Account of the Sun's Distance from the Earth, deduced from Mr. Short's Observations relating to the horizontal Parallax of the Sun: In a Letter from Peter Daval, Esq; V.P. of R.S. to James Barrow, Esq; V.P. of R.S.\n\nRead Jan. 13, 1763.\n\nAccording to Mr. Short, the mean horizontal parallax of the Sun is $8''$, $65$.\n\nNow this parallax is the angle, which the semidiameter of the earth subtends, being seen from the Sun.\n\nTherefore as $8''$, $65$, is to $360^\\circ$ (the whole periphery of a circle) so is the semidiameter of the earth to the periphery of the orbit of the earth round the Sun.\nSun. But $8''$, $65$, is very nearly $\\frac{1}{360}$th part of $360^\\circ$, as may be easily proved by division.\n\nAccording to the latest observations, the mean semidiameter of the earth is $3958$ English miles, which being multiplied by $149,826$ produces $593,011,308$ miles for the circumference of the orbit of the earth.\n\nThe distance of the earth from the Sun is the semidiameter of this orbit: and the periphery of the circle is to its semidiameter very nearly as $6,283,185$ to one.\n\nTherefore if we divide $593,011,308$ by $6,283,185$ the quotient, which is very nearly $94,380,685$, will give the mean distance of the earth from the Sun in English miles.\n\nN. B. As the orbit of the earth is an ellipse, not a circle, the distance of the earth from the Sun will be greater in its aphelion, and less in its perihelion, than here assigned.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have from Mr. Short's observations deduced, as above, the mean distance of the Sun from the earth, and am pretty sure I have made no material mistake.\n\nI am\n\nYour's entirely,\n\nDec. 18, 1762.\n\nPeter Daval.",
