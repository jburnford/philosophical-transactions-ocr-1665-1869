king of the Romans, called Antoninus Augustus,
Peroz, or Perozes, king of the Persians, (Parthians)
made an irruption into the Roman empire; from
whence he deduced the name Perozes, which
signifies The Conqueror, or The Victor, having
before been denominated Vologesus, according to
the Greeks, but by what name he went amongst
the Persians I have not yet been able to learn.”
Which passage seems not only to point at the defeat of
Lucius Attidius in (8) Syria, but likewise at the terrible
overthrow given the Romans in Armenia, soon after
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus ascended the
imperial throne.

I shall only beg leave at present to add, that the
(9) Arabic Firûz and the Persic or Armenian Peroz
agree entirely in signification, (10) if they may not be
considered as absolutely the same word; that a Persian
king, named Firûz by the Arabs, (11) is called Perozes
(Περόζης) by Agathias; that (12) Moses Chorenensis
and one, at least, of the medals here described mu-
tually strengthen and support each other; and that
I am, with all possible consideration and esteem,

Your most obedient humble Servant,
