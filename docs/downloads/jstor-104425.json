ANN Stubbensfull had a very hard Labour 17 Years before her Death, and a little Rupture appeared in her Navel, and in the next Labour it increased; which she endeavoured to cure by a Bandage, but in vain; so it continued to increase more and more.\n\nThe first time I was called to her, was upon account of a Wound at Lett. d. where it looked as if it would mortify; which I cured, but left a Place open as big as Half a Crown, from which a great Quantity of Water would sometimes run out; but getting Cold, it stopped; and the whole Saccus was very much inflamed (This Wound was formerly made by uneasy Trusses). I called on the late Mr. Amiand; who told me, he had seen in a Work-house a Rupture of the same Kind, but not so big.\n\nShe had once an Obstructio alvi for fifteen Days; and nothing would do, till I order'd her a Glyster of Tobacco boil'd with Urine. The late Dr. James Douglass saw her; and he and I agreed to open her after her Death; to which she consented. At last, she died maniacal. Dr. Douglass and I would have open'd her; but the Obstination of her Children was so great, that they would not agree to it till the fourth Day after her Death, which happened in July, when the Putrefaction was so great, that Dr. Douglass, nor I, nor any body else, could remain by her; and so were obliged, to our great Sorrows, to desist.\n\nReferences\nReferences to the Figures, see Tab. II. Fig. 4 and 5.\n\na. The Circumference nearest to the Belly 36 Inches and an half.\nb. The thickest Part, 38 Inches.\nc. From a to c, the Length, 34 Inches.\nd. The Wound.\ne. Several great Protuberances.\n\nVII. A Letter from Mr. Wm. Watson, F.R.S. to the Royal Society; containing further Remarks concerning Mushrooms: Occasioned by the Reverend Mr. Pickering's F.R.S. Paper in the preceding Transact. p. 96. with Observations upon the poisonous Faculty of some Sorts of Fungi.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nRead May 31. I HOPE I shall have the Reverend Mr. Pickering's Excuse, if I lay before you a few further Observations upon his Papers concerning Mushrooms.\n\nWith regard to the Seeds of Mushrooms, although they were never shewn to the Royal Society before, the Fact was known to many Members thereof: for the industrious Micheli did not only raise Mushrooms from their Seeds, but has, in his Tables, shewn the daily Progress from their first Point of Vegetation, even to their perfect State.\n\nThe Fungus porosus crassus magnus is not the Mushroom usually raised in England for the Table,\n",
