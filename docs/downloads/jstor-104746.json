Mr. Greenville, concerning an Earthquake felt at Bridport, on March 18. 1749-50.\n\nSIR,\n\nBridport, March 19. 1749.\n\nYesterday Morning the Sun shone very bright; which, between 11 and 12, was with thick dark Clouds so obscured, as render'd it darker than common. Soon after, a violent Clap of Thunder, and a heavy Shower of Hail, succeeded: After which it grew again serene; and in the Evening about 6, a Shock of an Earthquake was felt in this Town, and the neighbouring Villages, with (thro' Mercy) no other Damage than a great Surprize to all who felt it. I am,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour most obedient, and\n\nvery humble Servant,\n\nNath. Downe.",
