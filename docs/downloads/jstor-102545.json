An Account of some Indian Plants, &c. with their Names, Descriptions and Vertues; Communicated in a Letter from Mr. James Petiver, Apothecary and Fellow of the Royal Society; to Mr. Samuel Brown, Surgeon at Fort St. George.\n\nSIR,\n\nMy Opinion of the Plants you collected at Unanercoonda, about Twelve Miles from Fort St. George, as you desired, are as follows; in the same Order, and under those Malabar Names and Numbers you sent them to me: viz.\n\n1. Vellaiengeel maraum Malabar:\n   Arbor Madraspatana floribus hexapetalis heptapetalifve, fructu coronato.\n   \n   This is a sort of Angolam, of which there are Two Kinds described in the Hortus Malabaricus, viz. Vol. 4. Tab. 17. Pag. 39. and Tab. 26. p. 55.\n   \n   The Fruit of this having but one round flat Kernel, agrees with the Description of the last, but the Leaves seem rather to resemble the first, viz. those in Tab. 17.\n\n   N. B. You say, where Maraum is added it signifies a great Tree; the same I have formerly remarkt in the Hort. Malabar. of Mara and Maram. vid. Comel. in Not. H. Mal. Vol. 2. Tab. 49. p. 96.\n\n2. Naiureevee Malab.\n   Dr. Plukenet, that most accurate Botanist in his Phyto-graphia, Tab. 10. Fig. 4. calls this Amaranthus spicatus Dictamni Cretici folio Maderaspatensis, whose Figure resembles\nsembles this Plant very well while young, but the Leaves when full grown, are much larger, and the Spike longer, generally turning inwards. The *Hortus Malabaricus* seems to describe this in the 10th Volum, Tab. 78. Pag. 155. under the Name of *Cadelari*, which the *Brachmans* or *Brammins* call *Cante Mogaro*, ascribing these Vertues to it, viz.\n\nThat the Decoction takes away Swellings, abates the Sharpness of Urine, and eases the Stone; mixt with the Oyl Sergelin it stops pissing of Blood. The Root purges; being bruised and boil'd in Butter, it cures a Dysentery; a Drink of it strengthens the Stomach, expels Wind, corrects Phlegm, and breaks the Stone in the Bladder; being applied to the Arm it cures Agues; bruised and drank in Wine is good for the Gravel, provoking Urine, especially in Hydropick Persons; mixt with Lemons it kills Tettars, and takes away Swellings under the Chin, &c. the Seed powder'd and snufst up the Nose cures the Head ach.\n\n*Joannes Commelinus*, in his Notes on the *Hortus Malab.* takes this Plant to be the *Verbena Indica* Bontii in his Histor. Natural. Lib. 6. cap. 54. p. 150. (and I think not improperly) therefore it may not, I hope, be amiss to subjoin its Vertues with the aforegoing, viz.\n\nThat the Natives of Java and they themselves having learnt of them, apply the Leaves of this Plant bruised to Ulcers in the Thighs with good Success; because it dries very much, which Quality is there very beneficial, by reason the Constitution of the Air in those parts is hot and moist, which renders the Ulcers very stubborn and difficult to cure.\n\nThey give also a Spoonful of the fresh Juice of it in Colick Pains, Dysenteries, and without Distinction in all affects of the Bowels with very great Success; being bruised\nbruised and mixt with Vinegar, they apply it to the Breast in Swoonings, and all fainting Fits.\n\nHe farther says, the Indian Old Women esteem it there as a sacred Herb, and hold it very good for such as are Bewitcht, or under an Evil Tongue.\n\nThis nicely differs from the Amaranthus Siculus spi- catus radice perenni Bocconi, Tab. 9. p. 16. in having rounder Leaves, and those less white or hoary underneath.\n\n3. Nucheela Malab.\n\nVitex Madraspatana foliis latioribus digitatis, floribus racemosis.\n\nThis differs from the Common in having its Leaves somewhat broader, and its Flowers more sparse (or spread abroad) like those of Grapes on short Footstalks, whereas the Common grows close and at set Distances, like the Whorles on a Verticillated Plant.\n\nThe Fruit in Bigness and Colour resembles Black Pepper, but is smooth and shining, set in a large Bell-fashioned cinereous Calyx or Cup, and covers about half the Fruit, which is very hard, and so solid, that you can scarce distinguish any Kernel it hath, but as it were, an entire woody Substance and altogether insipid.\n\n4. Nella poonee Malab.\n\nArbuscula Madraspatana floribus exignis racemiferis.\n\nThe Leaves of this are many times only trifoliated, and sometimes winged; it has a racemosè Flower like the last, but smaller; I shall suspend my Judgment as to what particular Genus it may belong to, until I receive it in Ripe Fruit.\n\n5. Parawootan chedde Malab.\n\nBaccifera racemosa Madraspatana Juglandis folio nigris maculis elegantè asperfìs.\n\nIts Berries grow in Clusters, are round, black and coronated, no bigger than Pepper, each has a large Kernel and but little Pulp, which taste not unpleasant; its\nLeaves grow opposite and are remarkably sprinkled with black specks.\n\n6. Neer Mulle Malab.\n\n*Adhatoda Malabarica Spinoso Echii folio.*\n\nThe *Hortus Malabaricus* first gave us the Figure and Description of this strange Diuretick Plant, in the 2d. Vol. Tab. 45. p. 87. under the Malabar Name of *Babel Schulli*, since which Dr. Plukenet hath figured it in his *Phyt Tab.* 133. Fig. 4, stiling it *Anchusa angustifolia verticillis longis aculeis armata* & Maderaspatan & Alm. Bot. 30.\n\nI shall omit the Description of it here, because that most worthy Botanist Mr. John Ray, in his *Histor. Plant.* p. 1731. hath given it from the *Hortus Malab.* under the Denomination of *Genista spinosa Indica verticillata flore purpureo caeruleo seu Spartium spinosum siliqua geminata*.\n\nSince you tell me, Sir, it is a great Diuretick, and that you have seen, this and round Pepper boil'd in Water and drank Morning and Night cure the *Ascites* in a Portuguese Woman of 55 Years of Age; I hope it may not be amiss to tell you what Vertues the *Hortus Malabar.* attributes to it, viz.\n\nThat a Decoction of it provokes suppressed Urine, and abates the Swelling of the Belly in Hydropical Persons, and being taken with the Oil of the *Ficus Inferni* (by which I suppose is meant the *Ricinus Americanus* or *Palma Christi*) it cures the Dropsy as aforesaid, and breaks the Stone; the same externally applied dissolves Buboes. The Leaves also boil'd and pickled, being eaten are Diuretick.\n\nThe *Hortus Malab.* also confirms what you rightly observe, that this Plant grows in watry Places, and I am of the Opinion that the Malabar Syllable *Neer*, with you, signifies Aquatick, as I find *Nir* does in the *Hortus Malab.*\n\n7. Nella Walle Malab. Cara Veela *Hort. Mal.* V. 9. Tab. 24. p. 43. Veela & Tiloni Bram.6.\n\n*Five leaved Mock-Mustard.*\nSinapisstrum Indicum pentaphyllum flore carneo minus non spinosum Herm. Hort. Lugd. Bat.\n\nAlthough the Hort. Malab. does not give us this as a Plant certainly described by former Authors, yet I find it has been known ever since Prosper Alpinus his time, Antiquity, which is now somewhat more than 80 Years ago, he dying An. Dom. 1616.\n\nFor the several Synonyms of this Plant I refer you to Synonyms: Dr. Sloane's elaborate Catalogue of Jamaica Plants, p.80. only subjoining this one to it, which Dr. Plukenet, in his curious as well as copious Almagestum Botanicum, p.280. has since added, viz. Papaver corniculatum acre quinquefolium Ægyptiacum minus flore carneo non spinosum.\n\nSee a Description of it in Raii Hist. Plant. 859.\n\nThe whole Plant bruised and mixt with the Juice of Raca palam, takes away Tettars by washing with it; boil'd in Oyl it cures all Cutaneous Diseases, particularly the Leprosy. The rest of its Vertues are the same with the Aria veela, H. Mal. V. 9. Tab. 23. p. 41. which in a little time we shall have an Occasion to mention.\n\n8. Neerchomboo Malab.\n\nI cannot at present distinguish this to be in any thing different from our Common Typha or Cats-tail.\n\nNevertheless, I am very well pleased to see an English Plant an Inhabitant of so remote a Part.\n\n9. Vellicaungerree Malab.\n\nMr. Richard Sambach, an ingenious Surgeon now living at Worcester, a Person whom you formerly knew, was the first who brought me this Plant from the East Indies which, with many others, I communicated to that most accurate Botanist, Dr. Plukenet, who has figured it in his Phytogr. Tab. 120. Fig. 5. and calls it, Ricinus Altheæ folio molli & incano Maderapatanus & Alm. Bot. 321.\nThe Hortus Malab. had also figured and described it before in the 2d Vol. Tab. 39. p. 73. under the Mala-\nbar Name of Schorigenam, and by the Bram. Pitta Ga-\nsurculi, erroneously reckoning it amongst the Nettles,\nwhich induced that worthy Person, Mr. Ray. in his Hist.\nPlant. p. 160. to describe it under that Tribe; but it be-\ning a Tricoccon, is therefore truly, as above, placed a-\nmongst the Ricini.\n\nThe Hort. Malab. asserts that Rings made of the Root\nof this Plant and wore on the Toes, cures Fevers arising\nfrom Phlegm, and that a Decoction of it provokes Urine;\nthe Juice of it drank in Cows Milk with Sugar cures the\nItch and a Fever (as the Author terms it) in the Bones;\nthe Wood with the Berries bruised and applyed, cures\nsuch as are wounded with the Sting-Raye.\n\n10. Shevanar weamboo Malab.\n\nAnil Madera patana foliis minimis confertis.\n\nThis seems very well to agree with the Manelli Hort.\nMalab. V. 9. Tab. 37. p. 69. which says, the Flowers\nare of a beautiful red, which I want to be truly informed\nof, the Specimen you sent having Pods only.\n\n11. Marrellumetee Malab.\n\nA. The Lesser Burdock or Xanthium.\n\nXanthium sive (Lappa vel) Bardana minor Park. 1223.\nfig. bonâ. 1. B. Vol. 3. Lib. 33. p. 572. Fig. Chabr. Íc.\n514. Lappa minor Xanthium Dioscorid C B. 198. Phyt.\n373. Bardana minor Ger. 664. id. emac. 809. Fig. Ray\nHist. Plant. 165. Synopsis. 129. & edit. 2. p.\n\nThis is a Native of England, yet found but in few Pla-\nces, tho' pretty common in France, Spain, and Italy. I\nhave lately received it from the Island of Coos collected\nthere by my industrious Friend, Mr. Sam. Daniel, Sur-\ngeon; but you are the first that ever sent it me from the\nEast Indies.\nIt's of a different Genus from our Bardana or greater Burdock, and resembles it only in its hamated Spines, this being a Capsule or Husk about the Bigness of a St. Lucar (or Luke) Olive, wherein are two Cells or Partitions, each containing one oval flattish Kernel, with a blackish Film or Skin.\n\n12. Carennucheel Malab. by the English at Fort St. George, Black Agnus Castus.\n\nAdhatoda Madraspatana Hydropiperis folio.\n\nThis Plant in Leaf and Flower very much resembles the Vada Codi of the Hort. Malab. Vol. 9. Tab. 42. p. 79.\n\nIf you please to send it me in Seed I can better judge of it.\n\n13. Varamullee Malab. Coletta Veetla Hort. Malab. Vol. 9. Tab. 41. p. 77. Gontua Bram.

Malab.\n\nIt Flowers and Seeds in January and February.\n\nThe Juice cures Thrushes and the Swelling of the Bowels by Wind, the Natives chew the Leaves of this instead of the Betle. H. M. and it colours the Teeth black, as Mr. Benjamin Mewsé, who brought it me from Suratt, informs me.\n\nMooches.\n14. Mocchee chedee Malab.\n\nThis is a sort of *Phaseolus* or *Kidney-Bean*, of which Species you have many in your Parts, it is very difficult to distinguish them but by their ripe Pods or Seed, neither of which the Samples you sent afforded, it may probably be one of those described in the 8th Volum of the *Hortus Malab.* but by reason of the aforesaid Deficiencies, I dare not determine it.\n\n15. Corain-cheddee Malab.\n\n*Baccifera racemosa Madraspatana Lauri Ceras foliis, floribus parvis numerosissimis.*\n\n**Description.** The *Leaves* in Shape, Thickness and Magnitude, very much resemble our *Lawrel*, these stand on very short or no Foot-stalks, and are set opposite alternately (*i.e.* by Pairs cross-wise) as in our *Mint* and several other *verticillated Plants*, each side of the Stalk from whence the *Leaves* proceed is towards the Flowring part remarkably carinated or furrowed, towards the Extremities of each Branch proceeds the flowring part.\n\nThe *Flowers* are very many and small, grow in large Tufts or Branches admitting of several Ramifications, these are succeeded by a small *Coronated Fruit*, in Shape, Colour and Magnitude very much resembling the *Pimenta*, *All-Spice*, or *Jamaica-Pepper*, its inside also very like it.\n\n**Its Affinity.** It much resembles the Appel Hort. Malab. Vol. i. Tab. 53. p. 99. as to its *Fruit* and *Form of Growing*, but our *Leaves* are larger and more oblong.\n\n16. Serrusaulee Malab.\n\n*Periploca Madraspatana Smilacis folio.*\n\n**Description.** The *Leaves* are like those of our great white *Bindweed*, but not quite so large, they grow by Pairs at certain Joints, being generally accompanied with two smaller *Leaves* on very short Footstalks, from these Joints come forth\nforth small Clusters of little Flowers, like those of *Asclepias*; each of these are succeeded by a double thin Podd, which is about two Inches and a half long, and one where thickest. The Seed lies in that part next the Footstalks, they are roundish, flat, and membranaceous, of a brown Colour, and hem'd about with a rusty colour'd List or Selvedge; the Silky Down, which sticks to the Crown of the Seed is very white, and soft as Sattin; each Plume is $1\\frac{1}{4}$ Inch long.\n\nIt somewhat resembles the *Watta Kakacodi*, H. Mal. V. 9. Tab. 15. p. 25. in its scandent Quality, but our Leaves are more taper, and the Flowers come not from one Bottom, and seem somewhat smaller.\n\n17. Calovee Malab.\n\n*Convolvulus Madraspatanus flore auriculato, calycibus majoribus.*\n\nThis is a trailing Bindweed, its Leaves stand on half Inch Footstalks, the largest of them are somewhat more than an Inch over, and near two long, each ending in a sharp Point; at the Bosom of each Leaf, which stands at certain Distances, comes one small single Flower, very rarely two; these are succeeded by a round Capsule, ending in a long Thread somewhat Hoary, about the bigness of a Pea, these are surrounded with five Leaves, two larger, and between these, three smaller; a little below this Calyx are two small Leaves, for the generality set opposite; in each Husk are commonly found four smooth brownish triangular Seeds about the bigness of Musk-Seed.\n\nThis comes next of Kin to the *Vishnu-Ilandi*, H. Mal. V. 11. Tab. 64. p. 131. but differs thus; these Leaves are sharper pointed, and larger, and stand on Footstalks, the other the contrary; and from that of Bocco in having much larger Husks, &c.\n\nBbb\n\n18. Adaca\n18. Adaca-manjen, *H. Mal.* 10. Tab. 43. p. 85. Mundi Bram.\n\n**Synonyms.**\n\nPlanta Indica alato caule, folio crenato piloso & viscoso flore glomerato purpureo Com. in *H. Mal.* Scabiosa major crispatis foliis alato caule Malabariensis Alm. Bot. (which differs not from the Scabiosa Indica major caule & pediculis foliosis of Dr. Plukenet, in his *Phytographia*, Tab. 312. Fig. 6. and is the same with his Scab. minor alato caule Maderaspatensis Alm. Bot. 335. & Scabiosae capitulo Chrysanthemi Myconii foliis alato caule Maderaspatensis in his Phyt. Tab. 108. Fig. 7. this last being the Specimen of a younger Plant, and the second one of the same grown to more Maturity, as is very apparent in Samples of both which I have by me.\n\n**Vertues.**\n\nOf the *Leaves* and *Heads* of this Plant is made a Decoction good in Faintings occasion'd by Wind, as also Pains in the Bowels, but more especially if you add Cumin-Seed powdered, and rub the part grieved therewith. With the Powder of it and Oyl they make an Oyntment good against the Itch, and all cutaneous Diseases. Being mixt with Honey, it cures a Cough. Of the Root dried they make a Stomachick Powder; good also for the Gripes in the Bowels. The Bark of it being bruised and mixt with Whey cures the Piles. The Inhabitants put it in their Drink, *H. M.* as we do Wormwood.\n\n19. **Names.**\n\nCarpa Cacuanna *Mal.* Scanga cuspi altera species H. Mal. V. 8. p. 70. Cata roda Zeyl. Creuck Javan. Flos Clitoridis Ternatensis Brey n. Cent. p. 76.

The Root bruised and drank in warm Water purges gently, which Virtues confirm what you relate as to its Emetic and Cathartic Quality: But the Root, as well as Genus of this and the next vastly differs from the Ipécaçuanah of Piso, p. 231.\n\ned. 2.\n\n20.

Fig. 7.\n\nThe narrow leav'd white Malabar Leonurus.\n\nIt Flowers all the Year, and the bottom of each Flower contains a Hony-like Liquor, H. Mal.\n\nBoy'd in Oyl it cures the Itch, the Juice kills Worms in Ulcers, and being mixt with Lime it heals the biting of a Mad Dog. Taken up the Nose it eases the Head-ach. A Decoction of the Root drank cures the Leprosy. The Root or Leaves chewed and breathed on the Eyes takes away Films. H. Mal.\n\n22. Ponanggunne laccaree Mal.\n\nPerexil Madraspatana foliis oppositis angustioribus Polygoni.\n\nGeorgius Marcgravius, one of the first Observers of this Tribe of Plants tells us, the Portuguese call'd it Perexil, I have therefore chose rather to distinguish it by\nthis Particular short Name, than to reduce it to a longer, viz. Amarantho affinis Azoides, &c. to the close of which Species it may be nevertheless added, with such others as may not come so adaptly amongst the Amaranths themselves.\n\nI do not give you this as wholly new, there being one or two very like it, that I have received from the West-Indies, which, after I have more strictly examined, I shall farther inform you of.\n\nIt seems to grow erect, whether so or procumbent pray observe.\n\nNeer kille gelippe Mal.

It grows near three Foot high, the Leaves are disposed like those of our Garden Lupines, but never more than five from one center, they are Green above and Pale below; these stand on an Inch Footstalk, more or less, one side of which is furrow'd. The Stalk is round and carinated, at the Top of which its Golden Yellow Flowers grow in a Spike on short Footstalks, which are succeeded by a turgid bladder-like Pod, which terminates in a long Style.\n\nThe Hort. Malab. ascribes the same Vertues to the Seed of this Kind as he does to the Tandale cotti V. 9. Tab. 25. p. 45. which is of the same Species, viz. That they make a Bath of the Decoction good in Fevers, but most especially in tedious Tertian Agues.\n\nPunga maraum Mal. Pongam seu Minari H.\n\nMal. V. 6. Tab. 3. p. 5. Caransi Bram.

The Fruit also holds the same Disposition. Each Racema and its sub-divided Spikes of Flowers and Fruit are encompassed below with a membranaceous Vagina or Sheath, conspicuous in both, but more obvious when in Flower.\nThe Fruit of this Reed is eaten by the Inhabitants and with the Canes split they make their Net-like Seats, as we do here our Cane-Chairs and Stools of the same.

This Plant is commonly brancht, and runs up into very slender long Spikes.\n\nIt Flowers and Seeds in December and January.\n\n32. Narreepangul coodee Mal.\n\nBalsamina Madraspatana fructu parvo angulo pediculo affixa.\n\nThe Leaves are rough, have generally five Lobes, the two lower not so conspicuous, and sometimes wanting, the full grown Leaves stand on a prickly or rough Foot-stalk more than an Inch long, whose Serrae end in Spines, against which grows a curl'd Tendrel, which is guarded with a Lobe or Ear, whose Edges is surrounded with Hairs like those on the Leaves of Sundew at each Joyn between\nbetween the Leaf and Tendrel comes the Fruit which is brown, smooth, oblong, and angular about the bigness of a Barberry or somewhat larger, it stands on a very short Footstalk, and has its Corona against it in the middle of the Fruit, and not at the end, which is very remarkable.\n\n33. Podoodalle Mal.\n\nAn Verbena nodiflora C B. 269? Prod. 125. desc. & fig. opt. & Phyt. 524. desc?\n\nThis Plant very well agrees with the Figure and Description of this Author, who was the first that described it.\n\n34. Rutrashacaudumba Mal.\n\nJaca Madraspatana fructu Sparganii.\n\nThis may be the Jaca minor sylvestris Malabarica Comel in Hort. Malab. V. 4. Tab. 35. p. 73. but I have not as yet observed more than a single Fruit from one Place, set on longer or shorter Footstalks and branch- ed, whereas theirs is figured in Clusters (like our Chestnuts) and without Pedicles; the Leaves are somewhat broader and rounder, otherwise they have much the same Face and Texture with the true Jaca, as I have nicely observed by comparing it with a Specimen which that most Celebrated Botanist, JACOBUS BREITNIUS, sent me a little before his Death.\n\nThe Fruit of this is globular, very like the Burrs of Sparganium, but none that I have yet seen are quite so big, they are made up of small wart-like Tubercles, each rugose, like a Sweet Fennel-Seed, the Fruit cut open very much resembles that, so represented in the Hortus Malab.\n35. Caut Morunga Mal.\n\nOR\n\nWild Bezoar Tree.\n\nName.\n\nAnil Madraspatana trifoliata, siliquis carinatis hirtis.\n\nDescription.\n\nThis Plant in all the Samples I have yet observed, has only three Leaves, from the setting on of which comes forth Small Spikes of little Flowers, these are succeeded by as many Quadrangular, carinated, short-hair'd stiff Pods each an Inch long.\n\n36. Nella mullee Mal. Pee-Tumba H. Mal. V. 9. Tab. 46. p. 87. Butumbo Brach. Kawatuwa, Zeyl.\n\nSynonyms:\n\nEuphrasia affinis Indica Echioides H. Leyd. app. descript. & Fig. 663.

Lysimachia Virginianae accedens planta Com. in H. Mal.\n\nReferences.\n\nFor a Description of this Plant I refer you to the Hort. Malab. and Dr. Herman's Leyden Catalogue, in both which they are accurately performed, (the last is transcribed by Mr. Ray in the Appendix to his Hist. Plant. p. 1885) but the Figures of neither shews the Hoariness, which is very apparent in all parts of the Plant as my Specimens as well as the aforesaid Descriptions make very plainly appear.\n\nThe Leaves taken inwardly is an Antidote against the biting of a Mad Dog, and the Juice a Specifick in Agues H. M.\n\n37. Neer Caudumba.\n\nPentaphlora Madraspatana arborescens Benzoini foliis. I do not find any Plant in all the twelve Volumes of the Hortus Malabaricus, that this more nearly resembles than\nthan the Modagam, Vol. 4. Tab. 58. p. 119. but I dare not affirm it to be the same, until I am better informed of the Colour of its Flower, Shape of its Fruit, &c.\n\nSince I have mention'd the twelve Volumes of the Hort. Malab. which is indeed a very curious Work, I cannot omit telling you (it not being there taken notice of) that I am lately given to understand, that Dr. Wilhelmus Ten Rhyne a most ingenious Physitian and Botanist now living at Jacatra in Batavia, had a large share in composing that most Noble Herbal, as may be seen by Letters under his own Hand which he wrote to a Learned Physician of my Acquaintance, who was so kind to inform me of it.\n\n38. Combee chedde Mal.\n\nPentaphlora Madrafatana Nerii flore tubo longifimo.\n\nIts Leaves in Shape and Stiffness are like those of Laurel, at certain distances from the middle, the Veins are very conspicuous on both sides. The Flowers seem to resemble the Oleander or Rose-Bay, its long Neck or Tube in some of these are near two Inches long, being set in a small pentapetalose calyx not unlike those of Archangels, &c. this makes the Crown of the Fruit which is an oval Shell about the Bigness and Shape of a large Spanish Olive; internally it has three Selvedges to which the Pulp adheres, in which is contained a great many small flattish Seed.\n\n39. Neer Culuttee Mal. Culi Tamara H. Mal. V. 11. Tab. 45. p. 93.\n\nSagitta Indica major, folio obtuso, floribus minoribus albicantibus. Com. in H. Mal. p. 94. Sagittariae foliis planta, glomerato fructu, monopyrene, Coriandri serè figura Pluk. Tab. 220. Fig. 7. & Alm. Bot.\nThe Leaves are like our Arrow head, but the Spear broader and blunter, and the Barbs longer, the Flowers tripetalate, but it differs most in the Fruit, which grows in a Cluster like a Mulberry, but more separate, and each as big as a Curran, but by lying together are comprest.\n\n40. Wocta chedde Mal.\n\n*Ricinoides arborescens Madraspatana Cotini foliis.*\n\nThese Leaves grow alternately on 1 inch Footstalks, the largest of them are about one inch and an half broad, and two and an half long. Its Fruit very like a Bayberry, but somewhat bigger, its outer Skin being dry is brittle, thin, and shining as if varnished, brown and somewhat wrinkled like the Pistachioes, under which is a Shell also like them, but breaks into two or commonly three parts, separated with Partitions, each of which being split discovers one Seed much less than its Cavity, nor unlike those of *Cassia fistula*, but somewhat less and rounder, and pointed at one end.\n\n41. Shega pu coondamonce Mal. Konni H. Mal. V. 8. Tab. 39. p. 71. Fruita Contshi Lust. Ronde Weegbonen Belg.\n\n*Abrus minor Indiae Orientalis siliquis majoribus.*\n\nI chuse to distinguish it only by this Name at present; until I have more leisure to separate the American Synonyms from it, wherein I find it somewhat differs, particularly in its Pods and Form of growing, which in this are larger though fewer, and have more Seed in them, viz. seldom less than five or six, and the American rarely or never more than three.\n\nThe Leaves bruised and boil'd in Water or Oyl with *Calamus Aromaticus*, alleviates such gnawing Pains as arise from sharp corrosive phlegmatick Humours. The Powder also taken with Sugar stops Catarrhs. The Juice takes away all cold Pains in the Joints; the same being made\nmade into a Linament with long Pepper, Ginger, Milk and Sergelim-Oyl dissolves all thick and tough Humours. The Root Powder'd with Cummin and taken in Water, corrects and cuts rough Phlegm; the same with the Fruit and Coco-Nut-Milk cures the Piles. H. Mal.\n\n42. Cant Mandaree Mal.\n\nThere are four sorts of this particular leaved Tree, described in the first Volume of the Hort. Malab. Tab. 32, &c. the main Difference consists in the Shape and Colour of their Flowers, and Form of their full grown Podds, and until we have them in this Perfection, it will be difficult rightly to distinguish them.\n\n43. Curuta chedde Mal. Mal. an Naregam Hort. Malab. Vol. 4. Tab. 12. p. 27.\n\nLimo Madraspatanus apicibus foliorum ferè sinuatis, fructu cuspidato.\n\nThese Leaves stand on very short Footstalks, not above ½ of an inch long, the largest about an Inch broad, and not two long, taper at each end; but what is most remarkable in them is, they commonly terminate somewhat bifid, or as it were slit at the Point; they are perforated, and have the Texture of Lemmon Leaves; they altogether want that cordated Appendix next the Foot-stalk; its Thorns are woody and come from the bosom of the Leaves. Its Flowers grow in small Clusters, and seem to agree very well with the Figure and Description of the Mal Naregam H. Mal. V. 4. Tab. 12. p. 27. but the Fruit doth somewhat vary; it's about as big as a Cherry, and ends in a Point, has some Cortical Spots and seems porous as the Lemmons; its inside is divided into four Cells, in each of which I generally find one Kernel.\n\n44. This\n44. This has no Name in Malabar, in English P A R S L T.\n\nUnder this Denomination and Number I find two different Umbelliferous Plants, I presume these were cultivated in Gardens; for I have not yet seen any of this Species growing wild from your Parts, neither is there in all the Hortus Malab. one of this Genus there described.\n\n45. Yelavan maraum Mal.\n\nGossypium arboreum maximum spinosum, folio digitato, lanâ sericeâ griseâ Cat. Pl. Jam. 159.\n\nDr. Sloane, that most learned and accurate Botanist (to whose Catalogue I refer you for the many other Synonyms hereto belonging) observes that the Tunck of this Tree loses its Thorns as it grows old, and therefore supposes the smooth and thorny to be the same, whereas the Hortus Malab. Vol. 3. Tab. 49, &c. has taken no small Pains to make them distinct.\n\n46. Cooie cheddee Mal.\n\nPhaseolus Madraspatanus pubescens minor, siliquis recurvis. an P. Madrasp. Laplab effigie flore parvo ochroleuco Pluk. Tab. 213. Fig. 4? & Alm. Bot. 291?\n\nThe Leaves very well resembles Dr. Plukenet’s Figure; the whole Plant is somewhat hoary but particularly the Stalks; the Flowers seem yellowish, the ripe Podds turn a little backward and end in a Style or thread; they are of a Tawny or Phyllamort Colour, as are the Seeds which are flatish, small and seem somewhat marbled. Each Pod has five or six Seeds with Depressions between each.\n\nThus\nThus, Sir, I have given you my Sentiments of this your *Unanercoonda Collection*, and if herein I can be farther Serviceable to you, be pleased freely to Command,\n\n*Worthy Sir,*  \n\nFrom my House in  \n*Aldersgate-street,*  \n*LONDON;*  \n*Sept. 24. 1698.*\n\nYour most Obliged Friend,\n\nand Humble Servant,\n\nJames Petiver.",
