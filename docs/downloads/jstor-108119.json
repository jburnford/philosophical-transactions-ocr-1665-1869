By William Rowan Hamilton, Member of several Scientific Societies in Great Britain and in Foreign Countries, Andrews' Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland. Communicated by Captain Beaufort, R.N. F.R.S.\n\nReceived October 29, 1834,—Read January 15, 1835.\n\nIntroductory Remarks.\n\nThe former Essay* contained a general method for reducing all the most important problems of dynamics to the study of one characteristic function, one central or radical relation. It was remarked at the close of that Essay, that many eliminations required by this method in its first conception, might be avoided by a general transformation, introducing the time explicitly into a part $S$ of the whole characteristic function $V$; and it is now proposed to fix the attention chiefly on this part $S$, and to call it the Principal Function. The properties of this part or function $S$, which were noticed briefly in the former Essay, are now more fully set forth; and especially its uses in questions of perturbation, in which it dispenses with many laborious and circuitous processes, and enables us to express accurately the disturbed configuration of a system by the rules of undisturbed motion, if only the initial components of velocities be changed in a suitable manner. Another manner of extending rigorously to disturbed motion the rules of undisturbed, by the gradual variation of elements, in number double the number of the coordinates or other marks of position of the system, which was first invented by Lagrange, and was afterwards improved by Poisson, is considered in this Second Essay under a form perhaps a little more general; and the general method of calculation which has already been applied to other analogous questions in optics and in dynamics by the author of the present Essay, is now applied to the integration of the equations which determine these elements. This general method is founded chiefly on a combination of the principles of variations with those of partial differentials, and may furnish, when it shall be matured by the labours of other analysts, a separate branch of algebra, which may be called perhaps the Calculus of Principal Functions; because, in all the chief applications of algebra to physics, and in a very extensive class of purely mathematical questions, it reduces the determination of many mutually connected functions to the search and study of one principal or central relation. When applied to the integration of the equations of varying elements, it suggests, as is now shown, the consideration\n\n* Philosophical Transactions for the year 1834, Second Part.\nof a certain Function of Elements, which may be variously chosen, and may either be rigorously determined, or at least approached to, with an indefinite accuracy, by a corollary of the general method. And to illustrate all these new general processes, but especially those which are connected with problems of perturbation, they are applied in this Essay to a very simple example, suggested by the motions of projectiles, the parabolic path being treated as the undisturbed. As a more important example, the problem of determining the motions of a ternary or multiple system, with any laws of attraction or repulsion, and with one predominant mass, which was touched upon in the former Essay, is here resumed in a new way, by forming and integrating the differential equations of a new set of varying elements, entirely distinct in theory (though little differing in practice) from the elements conceived by Lagrange, and having this advantage, that the differentials of all the new elements for both the disturbed and disturbing masses may be expressed by the coefficients of one disturbing function.\n\nTransformations of the Differential Equations of Motion of an Attracting or Repelling System.\n\n1. It is well known to mathematicians, that the differential equations of motion of any system of free points, attracting or repelling one another according to any functions of their distances, and not disturbed by any foreign force, may be comprised in the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\sum m (x'' \\delta x + y'' \\delta y + z'' \\delta z) = \\delta U : \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots .(1.) \\]\n\nthe sign of summation \\( \\Sigma \\) extending to all the points of the system; \\( m \\) being, for any one such point, the constant called its mass, and \\( xyz \\) being its rectangular coordinates; while \\( x'', y'', z'' \\) are the accelerations, or second differential coefficients taken with respect to the time, and \\( \\delta x, \\delta y, \\delta z \\) are any arbitrary infinitesimal variations of those coordinates, and \\( U \\) is a certain force-function, introduced into dynamics by Lagrange, and involving the masses and mutual distances of the several points of the system. If the number of those points be \\( n \\), the formula (1.) may be decomposed into \\( 3n \\) ordinary differential equations of the second order, between the coordinates and the time,\n\n\\[ m_i x''_i = \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta x_i}; \\quad m_i y''_i = \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta y_i}; \\quad m_i z''_i = \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta z_i} : \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots .(2.) \\]\n\nand to integrate these differential equations of motion of an attracting or repelling system, or some transformations of these, is the chief and perhaps ultimately the only problem of mathematical dynamics.\n\n2. To facilitate and generalize the solution of this problem, it is useful to express previously the \\( 3n \\) rectangular coordinates \\( xyz \\) as functions of \\( 3n \\) other and more general marks of position \\( \\eta_1 \\eta_2 \\ldots \\eta_{3n} \\); and then the differential equations of motion take this more general form, discovered by Lagrange,\n\\[ \\frac{dT}{dt} \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_i} - \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta_i} = \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\]  \n\n(3.)\n\nin which\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum m (x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2). \\]\n\n(4.)\n\nFor, from the equations (2.) or (1.), \n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta \\eta_i} = \\sum m \\left( x'' \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_i} + y'' \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\eta_i} + z'' \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{d}{dt} \\sum m \\left( x' \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_i} + y' \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\eta_i} + z' \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ - \\sum m \\left( x' \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_i} + y' \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\eta_i} + z' \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right); \\]\n\n(5.)\n\nin which\n\n\\[ \\sum m \\left( x' \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_i} + y' \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\eta_i} + z' \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\sum m \\left( x' \\frac{\\delta x'}{\\delta \\eta_i} + y' \\frac{\\delta y'}{\\delta \\eta_i} + z' \\frac{\\delta z'}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right) = \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_i}, \\]\n\n(6.)\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\sum m \\left( x' \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_i} + y' \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta \\eta_i} + z' \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\sum m \\left( x' \\frac{\\delta x'}{\\delta \\eta_i} + y' \\frac{\\delta y'}{\\delta \\eta_i} + z' \\frac{\\delta z'}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right) = \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta_i}, \\]\n\n(7.)\n\n\\( T \\) being here considered as a function of the 6 \\( n \\) quantities of the forms \\( \\eta' \\) and \\( \\eta \\), obtained by introducing into its definition (4.), the values\n\n\\[ x' = \\eta'_1 \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_1} + \\eta'_2 \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_2} + \\ldots + \\eta'_{3n} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta \\eta_{3n}}, \\text{ &c.} \\]\n\n(8.)\n\nA different proof of this important transformation (3.) is given in the Mécanique Analytique.\n\n3.

And all these $6n$ functions, or $6n$ relations to determine them, may be expressed, with perfect generality and rigour, by the method of the former Essay, or by the following simplified process.\n\n**Integration of the Equations of Motion, by means of one Principal Function.**\n\n4. If we take the variation of the definite integral\n\n$$S = \\int_0^{t'} \\left( \\Sigma \\varpi \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\varpi} - H \\right) dt \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (18.)$$\n\nwithout varying $t$ or $dt$, we find, by the Calculus of Variations,\n\n$$\\delta S = \\int_0^{t'} \\delta S' \\cdot dt, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (19.)$$\n\nin which\n\n$$S' = \\Sigma \\varpi \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\varpi} - H, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (20.)$$\nand therefore\n\n\\[ \\delta S' = \\Sigma \\left( \\varpi \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\varpi} - \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\eta} \\frac{\\delta \\eta}{\\delta t} \\right), \\]  \n\nthat is, by the equations of motion (A.), \n\n\\[ \\delta S' = \\Sigma \\left( \\varpi \\frac{d \\eta}{dt} + \\frac{d \\varpi}{dt} \\frac{\\delta \\eta}{\\delta t} \\right) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\Sigma \\cdot \\varpi \\delta \\eta; \\]\n\nthe variation of the integral \\( S \\) is therefore\n\n\\[ \\delta S = \\Sigma (\\varpi \\delta \\eta - p \\delta e), \\]\n\n\\( p \\) and \\( e \\) being still initial values,) and it decomposes itself into the following \\( 6n \\) expressions, when \\( S \\) is considered as a function of the \\( 6n \\) quantities \\( \\eta_i e_i \\) (involving also the time),\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\n\\varpi_1 &= \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta \\eta_1}; & p_1 &= -\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta e_1}; \\\\\n\\varpi_2 &= \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta \\eta_2}; & p_2 &= -\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta e_2}; \\\\\n&\\vdots & &\\vdots \\\\\n\\varpi_{3n} &= \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta \\eta_{3n}}; & p_{3n} &= -\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta e_{3n}};\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\nwhich are evidently forms for the sought integrals of the \\( 6n \\) differential equations of motion (A.), containing only one unknown function \\( S \\). The difficulty of mathematical dynamics is therefore reduced to the search and study of this one function \\( S \\), which may for that reason be called the Principal Function of motion of a system.\n\nThis function \\( S \\) was introduced in the first Essay under the form\n\n\\[ S = \\int_0^t (T + U) dt, \\]\n\nthe symbols \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) having in this form their recent meanings; and it is worth observing, that when \\( S \\) is expressed by this definite integral, the conditions for its variation vanishing (if the final and initial coordinates and the time be given) are precisely the differential equations of motion (3.), under the forms assigned by Lagrange. The variation of this definite integral \\( S \\) has therefore the double property, of giving the differential equations of motion for any transformed coordinates when the extreme positions are regarded as fixed, and of giving the integrals of those differential equations when the extreme positions are treated as varying.\n\n5. Although the function \\( S \\) seems to deserve the name here given it of Principal Function, as serving to express, in what appears the simplest way, the integrals of the equations of motion, and the differential equations themselves; yet the same analysis conducts to other functions, which also may be used to express the integrals of the same equations. Thus, if we put\n\n\\[ Q = \\int_0^t \\left( -\\Sigma \\cdot \\eta \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\eta} + H \\right) dt, \\]\n\nand take the variation of this integral \\( Q \\) without varying \\( t \\) or \\( dt \\), we find, by a similar process,\n\n\\[ \\delta Q = \\Sigma (\\eta \\delta \\varpi - e \\delta p); \\]\nso that if we consider $Q$ as a function of the $6n$ quantities $\\varphi_i$, $p_i$ and of the time, we shall have $6n$ expressions\n\n$$\\eta_i = + \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\varphi_i}, \\quad e_i = - \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta p_i}, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (26.)$$\n\nwhich are other forms for the integrals of the equations of motion (A.), involving the function $Q$ instead of $S$. We might also employ the integral\n\n$$V = \\int_0^t \\Sigma \\cdot \\varphi \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\varphi} \\, dt = \\Sigma \\int_{e^n} \\varphi \\, d\\eta, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (27.)$$\n\nwhich was called the Characteristic Function in the former Essay, and of which, when considered as a function of the $6n + 1$ quantities $\\eta_i$, $e_i$, $H$, the variation is\n\n$$\\delta V = \\Sigma (\\varphi \\delta \\eta - p \\delta e) + t \\delta H. \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (28.)$$\n\nAnd all these functions $S$, $Q$, $V$, are connected in such a way, that the forms and properties of any one may be deduced from those of any other.\n\n**Investigation of a Pair of Partial Differential Equations of the first Order, which the Principal Function must satisfy.**\n\n6. In forming the variation (23.), or the partial differential coefficients (B.), of the Principal Function $S$, the variation of the time was omitted; but it is easy to calculate the coefficient $\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta t}$ corresponding to this variation, since the evident equation\n\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta t} + \\Sigma \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta \\eta} \\frac{d\\eta}{dt}. \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (29.)$$\n\ngives, by (20.), and by (A.), (B.),\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta t} = S' - \\Sigma \\cdot \\varphi \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\varphi} = - H. \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (30.)$$\n\nIt is evident also that this coefficient, or the quantity $- H$, is constant, so as not to alter during the motion of the system; because the differential equations of motion (A.) give\n\n$$\\frac{dH}{dt} = \\Sigma \\left( \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\eta} \\frac{d\\eta}{dt} + \\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta \\varphi} \\frac{d\\varphi}{dt} \\right) = 0. \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (31.)$$\n\nIf, therefore, we attend to the equation (17.), and observe that the function $F$ is necessarily rational and integer and homogeneous of the second dimension with respect to the quantities $\\varphi_i$, we shall perceive that the principal function $S$ must satisfy the two following equations between its partial differential coefficients of the first order, which offer the chief means of discovering its form:\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta t} + F \\left( \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta \\eta_1}, \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta \\eta_2}, \\ldots \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta \\eta_{3n}}, \\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\ldots \\eta_{3n} \\right) = U (\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\ldots \\eta_{3n}), \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (C.)$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta t} + F \\left( \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta e_1}, \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta e_2}, \\ldots \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta e_{3n}}, e_1, e_2, \\ldots e_{3n} \\right) = U (e_1, e_2, \\ldots e_{3n}). \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (C.)$$\nReciprocally, if the form of $S$ be known, the forms of these equations (C.) can be deduced from it, by elimination of the quantities $e$ or $\\eta$ between the expressions of its partial differential coefficients; and thus we can return from the principal function $S$ to the functions $F$ and $U$, and consequently to the expression $H$, and the equations of motion (A.).\n\nAnalogous remarks apply to the functions $Q$ and $V$, which must satisfy the partial differential equations,\n\n$$-\\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta t} + F \\left( \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\omega_1}, \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\omega_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\omega_n} \\right) = U \\left( \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\omega_1}, \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\omega_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\omega_n} \\right),$$\n\n$$-\\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta t} + F \\left( \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta p_1}, \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta p_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta p_n} \\right) = U \\left( -\\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta p_1}, -\\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta p_2}, \\ldots, -\\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta p_n} \\right),$$\n\nand\n\n$$F \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta \\eta_1}, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta \\eta_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta \\eta_n} \\right) = H + U (\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\ldots, \\eta_n),$$\n\n$$F \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta e_1}, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta e_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta e_n} \\right) = H + U (e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_n).$$\n\nGeneral Method of improving an approximate Expression for the Principal Function in any Problem of Dynamics.\n\n7.

The foregoing theory gives indeed rigorous expressions for the perturbations, in passing from the simpler motion (H.) or (I.) to the more complex motion (G.) or (K.): but it may seem that these expressions are of little use, because they involve an unknown disturbing function $S_2$, (namely, the perturbational part of the whole principal function $S_2$) and also unknown or disturbed coordinates or marks of position $\\eta_i$. However, it was lately shown that whenever a first approximate form for the principal function $S_2$, such as here the principal function $S_1$ of undisturbed motion, has been found, the correction $S_2$ can in general be assigned, with an indefinitely increasing\naccuracy; and since the perturbations (M.) and (O.) involve the disturbed coordinates \\( \\eta_i \\) only as they enter into the coefficients of this small disturbing function \\( S_2 \\), it is evidently permitted to substitute for these coordinates, at first, their undisturbed values, and then to correct the results by substituting more accurate expressions.\n\n11.

Now it is remarkable that this elimination removes the symbol $t$ also, and leaves the coefficients $a_{i,s}$ expressed as functions of the elements $x$ alone, not explicitly involving the time. This general theorem of dynamics, which is, perhaps, a little more extensive than the analogous results discovered by Lagrange and by Poisson, since it does not limit the disturbing terms in the differential equations of motion to depend on the configuration only, may be investigated in the following way.\n\n15.

For if we consider the earth as a sphere, of radius $R$, and suppose the accelerating force of gravity to vary inversely as the square of the distance $r$ from its centre, and to be $= g$ at the surface, this force will be represented generally by $\\frac{g R^2}{r^2}$; and to adapt the differential equations (78.) to the motion of a projectile in a void, it will be sufficient to make\n\n$$U = g R^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{R} \\right) $$\n\nIf we place the origin of rectangular coordinates at the earth's surface, and suppose the semiaxis of $+ z$ to be directed vertically upwards, we shall have\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{(R + z)^2 + x^2 + y^2}, $$\n\nand\n\n$$U = - g z + \\frac{gz^2}{R} - \\frac{g(x^2 + y^2)}{2R}, $$\n\nneglecting only those very small terms which have the square of the earth’s radius for a divisor: neglecting therefore such terms, the force-function $U$ in this question is of that form (110.) on which all the reasonings of the example have been founded; the small constants $\\mu$, $\\nu$, being the real and imaginary quantities $\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}, \\sqrt{-\\frac{2g}{R}},$ respectively. We may therefore apply the results of the recent numbers to the motions of projectiles in a void, by substituting these values for the constants, and altering, where necessary, trigonometrical to exponential functions. But besides the theoretical facility and the little practical importance of researches respecting such projectiles, the results would only be accurate as far as the first negative power (inclusive) of the earth’s radius, because the expression (110.) for the force-function $U$ is only accurate so far; and therefore the rigorous and approximate investigations of the six preceding numbers, founded on that expression, are offered only as mathematical illustrations of a general method, extending to all problems of dynamics, at least to all those to which the law of living forces applies.\n\n**Attracting Systems resumed:** Differential Equations of internal or Relative Motion; Integration by the Principal Function.\n\n31. Returning now from this digression on the motion of a single point, to the more important study of an attracting or repelling system, let us resume the differential equations (A.), which may be thus summed up:\nand in order to separate the absolute motion of the whole system in space from the motions of its points among themselves, let us choose the following marks of position:\n\n\\[ x_{ii} = \\frac{\\Sigma m x}{\\Sigma m}, \\quad y_{ii} = \\frac{\\Sigma m y}{\\Sigma m}, \\quad z_{ii} = \\frac{\\Sigma m z}{\\Sigma m}, \\quad (176.) \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\xi_i = x_i - x_n, \\quad \\eta_i = y_i - y_n, \\quad \\zeta_i = z_i - z_n; \\quad (177.) \\]\n\nthat is, the 3 rectangular coordinates of the centre of gravity of the system, referred to an origin fixed in space, and the \\(3n-3\\) rectangular coordinates of the \\(n-1\\) masses \\(m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_{n-1}\\), referred to the \\(n\\)th mass \\(m_n\\), as an internal and moveable origin, but to axes parallel to the former. We then find, as in the former Essay,\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} (x_{ii}^2 + y_{ii}^2 + z_{ii}^2) \\Sigma m \\]\n\\[ + \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma_i \\cdot m (\\xi_i^2 + \\eta_i^2 + \\zeta_i^2) - \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma_m \\{(\\Sigma_i \\cdot m \\xi)^2 + (\\Sigma_i \\cdot m \\eta)^2 + (\\Sigma_i \\cdot m \\zeta)^2\\}, \\quad (178.) \\]\n\nthe sign of summation \\(\\Sigma_i\\) referring to the first \\(n-1\\) masses only; and therefore,\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma_m \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta x_{ii}} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta y_{ii}} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta z_{ii}} \\right)^2 \\right\\} \\]\n\\[ + \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma_i \\cdot m \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\xi_i} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\zeta_i} \\right)^2 \\right\\} \\]\n\\[ + \\frac{1}{2} m_n \\left\\{ \\left( \\Sigma_i \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\xi_i} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\Sigma_i \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta_i} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\Sigma_i \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\zeta_i} \\right)^2 \\right\\}. \\quad (179.) \\]\n\nIf then we put for abridgement,\n\n\\[ x'_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\xi_i} = \\xi_i - \\frac{\\Sigma_i \\cdot m \\xi_i}{\\Sigma m}, \\]\n\\[ y'_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta_i} = \\eta_i - \\frac{\\Sigma_i \\cdot m \\eta_i}{\\Sigma m}, \\]\n\\[ z'_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\zeta_i} = \\zeta_i - \\frac{\\Sigma_i \\cdot m \\zeta_i}{\\Sigma m}, \\quad (180.) \\]\n\nwe shall have the expression\n\n\\[ H = \\frac{1}{2} (x_{ii}^2 + y_{ii}^2 + z_{ii}^2) \\Sigma m + \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma_i \\cdot m (x'_i^2 + y'_i^2 + z'_i^2) \\]\n\\[ + \\frac{1}{2} m_n \\{(\\Sigma_i \\cdot m x'_i)^2 + (\\Sigma_i \\cdot m y'_i)^2 + (\\Sigma_i \\cdot m z'_i)^2\\} - U, \\quad (B^2.) \\]\n\nof which the variation is to be compared with the following form of \\((A^2.)\\),\n\n\\[ dt \\delta H = (dx_{ii} \\delta x_{ii} - dx'_i \\delta x'_i + dy_{ii} \\delta y_{ii} - dy'_i \\delta y'_i + dz_{ii} \\delta z_{ii} - dz'_i \\delta z'_i) \\Sigma m \\]\n\\[ + \\Sigma_i \\cdot m (d\\xi \\delta x'_i - d\\xi' \\delta \\xi + d\\eta \\delta y'_i - d\\eta' \\delta \\eta + d\\zeta \\delta z'_i - d\\zeta' \\delta \\zeta), \\quad (C^2.) \\]\n\nin order to form, by our general process, \\(6n\\) differential equations of motion of the first order, between the \\(6n\\) quantities \\(x_{ii}, y_{ii}, z_{ii}, x'_i, y'_i, z'_i\\) and the time \\(t\\). In thus taking the variation of \\(H\\), we are to remember that the force-function \\(U\\) depends only on the \\(3n-3\\) internal coordinates \\(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta\\), being of the form\n\\[ U = m_n (m_1 f_1 + m_2 f_2 + \\ldots + m_{n-1} f_{n-1}) + m_1 m_2 f_{1,2} + m_1 m_3 f_{1,3} + \\ldots + m_{n-2} m_{n-1} f_{n-2,n-1}, \\]  \n(D².)\n\nin which \\( f_i \\) is a function of the distance of \\( m_i \\) from \\( m_n \\), and \\( f_{i,k} \\) is a function of the distance of \\( m_i \\) from \\( m_k \\), such that their derived functions or first differential coefficients, taken with respect to the distances, express the laws of mutual repulsion, being negative in the case of attraction; and then we obtain, as we desired, two separate groups of equations, for the motion of the whole system of points in space, and for the motions of those points among themselves; namely, first, the group\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ndx_{ii} &= x'_{ii} dt, \\quad dx'_{ii} = 0, \\\\\ndy_{ii} &= y'_{ii} dt, \\quad dy'_{ii} = 0, \\\\\ndz_{ii} &= z'_{ii} dt, \\quad dz'_{ii} = 0,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand secondly the group\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nd\\xi &= \\left( x'_i + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_i m x'_i \\right) dt, \\quad d x'_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\xi} dt, \\\\\nd\\eta &= \\left( y'_i + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_i m y'_i \\right) dt, \\quad d y'_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\eta} dt, \\\\\nd\\zeta &= \\left( z'_i + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_i m z'_i \\right) dt, \\quad d z'_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\zeta} dt.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe six differential equations of the first order, (181.), between \\( x_{ii}, y_{ii}, z_{ii}, x'_i, y'_i, z'_i \\) and \\( t \\), contain the law of rectilinear and uniform motion of the centre of gravity of the system; and the \\( 6n - 6 \\) equations of the same order, (182.), between the \\( 6n - 6 \\) variables \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x'_i, y'_i, z'_i \\) and the time, are forms for the differential equations of internal or relative motion. We might eliminate the \\( 3n - 3 \\) auxiliary variables \\( x'_i, y'_i, z'_i \\) between these last equations, and so obtain the following other group of \\( 3n - 3 \\) equations of the second order, involving only the relative coordinates and the time,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\xi'' &= \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\xi} + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\xi}, \\\\\n\\eta'' &= \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\eta} + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\eta}, \\\\\n\\zeta'' &= \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\zeta} + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\zeta};\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nbut it is better for many purposes to retain them under the forms (182.), omitting, however, for simplicity, the lower accents of the auxiliary variables \\( x'_i, y'_i, z'_i \\), because it is easy to prove that these auxiliary variables (180.) are the components of centrobaric velocity, and because, in investigating the properties of internal or relative motion, we are at liberty to suppose that the centre of gravity of the system is fixed in space, at the origin of \\( x, y, z \\). We may also, for simplicity, omit the lower accent of \\( \\Sigma \\), understanding that the summations are to fall only on the first \\( n - 1 \\) masses, and denoting for greater distinctness the \\( n \\)th mass by a separate symbol \\( M \\); and then we\nmay comprise the differential equations of relative motion in the following simplified formula,\n\n\\[ dt \\delta H = \\Sigma . m (d\\xi \\delta x' - dx' \\delta \\xi + d\\eta \\delta y' - dy' \\delta \\eta + d\\zeta \\delta z' - dz' \\delta \\zeta), \\quad (E^2) \\]\n\nin which\n\n\\[ H = \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma . m (x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2) + \\frac{1}{2M} \\left\\{ (\\Sigma . m x')^2 + (\\Sigma . m y')^2 + (\\Sigma . m z')^2 \\right\\} - U. \\quad (F^2) \\]\n\nAnd the integrals of these equations of relative motion are contained (by our general method) in the formula\n\n\\[ \\delta S = \\Sigma . m (x' \\delta \\xi - a' \\delta \\alpha + y' \\delta \\eta - b' \\delta \\beta + z' \\delta \\zeta - c' \\delta \\gamma), \\quad (G^o) \\]\n\nin which \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, a', b', c' \\) denote the initial values of \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z' \\), and \\( S \\) is the principal function of relative motion of the system; that is, the former function \\( S \\), simplified by the omission of the part which vanishes when the centre of gravity is fixed, and which gives in general the laws of motion of that centre, or the integrals of the equations (181.).\n\nSecond Example: Case of a Ternary or Multiple System with one Predominant Mass; Equations of the undisturbed motions of the other masses about this, in their several Binary Systems; Differentials of all their Elements, expressed by the coefficients of one Disturbing Function.\n\n32. Let us now suppose that the \\( n - 1 \\) masses \\( m \\) are small in comparison with the \\( n \\)th mass \\( M \\); and let us separate the expression \\( (F^2) \\) for \\( H \\) into the two following parts,\n\n\\[ H_1 = \\Sigma . \\frac{m}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{m}{M} \\right) (x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2) - M \\Sigma . mf, \\]\n\\[ H_2 = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{M} (x'_1 x'_2 + y'_1 y'_2 + z'_1 z'_2 - Mf_{1,2}) + \\ldots \\]\n\\[ + \\frac{m_i m_k}{M} (x'_i x'_k + y'_i y'_k + z'_i z'_k - Mf_{i,k}) + \\ldots, \\quad (H^2) \\]\n\nof which the latter is small in comparison with the former, and may be neglected in a first approximation. Suppressing it accordingly, we are conducted to the following \\( 6n - 6 \\) differential equations of the 1st order, belonging to a simpler motion, which may be called the undisturbed:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\xi}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m} \\delta H_1 = \\left( 1 + \\frac{m}{M} \\right) x'; \\quad \\frac{dx'}{dt} = - \\frac{1}{m} \\delta H_1 = M \\delta f; \\]\n\\[ \\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m} \\delta H_1 = \\left( 1 + \\frac{m}{M} \\right) y'; \\quad \\frac{dy'}{dt} = - \\frac{1}{m} \\delta H_1 = M \\delta f; \\]\n\\[ \\frac{d\\zeta}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m} \\delta H_1 = \\left( 1 + \\frac{m}{M} \\right) z'; \\quad \\frac{dz'}{dt} = - \\frac{1}{m} \\delta H_1 = M \\delta f. \\quad (I^2) \\]\n\nThese equations arrange themselves in \\( n - 1 \\) groups, corresponding to the \\( n - 1 \\) binary systems \\((m, M)\\); and it is easy to integrate the equations of each group separately. We may suppose, then, these integrals found, under the forms,\n\n\\[ z = \\chi^{(1)} (t, \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z'), \\quad v = \\chi^{(4)} (t, \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z'), \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = \\chi^{(2)} (t, \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z'), \\quad \\tau = \\chi^{(5)} (t, \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z'), \\]\n\\[ \\mu = \\chi^{(3)} (t, \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z'), \\quad \\omega = \\chi^{(6)} (t, \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z'). \\quad (K^2) \\]\nthe six quantities \\( z, \\lambda, \\mu, \\nu, \\tau, \\omega \\) being constant for the undisturbed motion of any one binary system; and therefore the six functions \\( \\chi^{(1)}, \\chi^{(2)}, \\chi^{(3)}, \\chi^{(4)}, \\chi^{(5)}, \\chi^{(6)} \\), or \\( z, \\lambda, \\mu, \\nu, \\tau, \\omega \\), being such as to satisfy identically the following equation,\n\n\\[\n0 = m \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta t} + \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta \\xi} \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta x'} - \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta x'} \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\xi} + \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta y'} \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\eta} - \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta \\eta} \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta y'} + \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta z'} \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\zeta} - \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta \\zeta} \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta z'}, \\quad (L^2)\n\\]\n\nwith five other equations analogous, for the five other elements \\( \\lambda, \\mu, \\nu, \\tau, \\omega \\), in any one binary system \\((m, M)\\).\n\n33. Returning now to the original multiple system, we may retain as definitions the equations \\((K^2)\\), but then we can no longer consider the elements \\( z_i, \\lambda_i, \\mu_i, \\nu_i, \\tau_i, \\omega_i \\) of the binary system \\((m_i, M)\\) as constant, because this system is now disturbed by the other masses \\( m_k \\); however, the \\( 6n - 6 \\) equations of disturbed relative motion, when put under the forms\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nm \\frac{d\\xi}{dt} &= \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta x'} + \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x'}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d\\eta}{dt} &= \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta y'} + \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta y'}, \\\\\nm \\frac{dz}{dt} &= \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta z'} + \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta z'}, \\\\\nm \\frac{dx}{dt} &= -\\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\xi} - \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\xi}, \\\\\nm \\frac{dy}{dt} &= -\\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\eta} - \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\eta}, \\\\\nm \\frac{dz}{dt} &= -\\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\zeta} - \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\zeta},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand combined with the identical equations of the kind \\((L^2)\\), give the following simple expression for the differential of the element \\( z \\), in its disturbed and variable state,\n\n\\[\nm \\frac{dz}{dt} = \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta \\xi} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x'} - \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta x'} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\xi} + \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta \\eta} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta y'} - \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta y'} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\eta} + \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta \\zeta} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta z'} - \\frac{\\delta \\chi}{\\delta z'} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\zeta}, \\quad (N^2)\n\\]\n\ntogether with analogous expressions for the differentials of the other elements. And if we express \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z' \\), and therefore \\( H_2 \\) itself, as depending on the time and on these varying elements, we may transform the \\( 6n - 6 \\) differential equations of the 1st order, \\((M^2)\\), between \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, x', y', z', t \\), into the same number of equations of the same order between the varying elements and the time; which will be of the forms\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nm \\frac{dz}{dt} &= \\{z, \\lambda\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\lambda} + \\{z, \\mu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\mu} + \\{z, \\nu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\nu} + \\{z, \\tau\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau} + \\{z, \\omega\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\omega}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} &= \\{\\lambda, z\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x} + \\{\\lambda, \\mu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\mu} + \\{\\lambda, \\nu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\nu} + \\{\\lambda, \\tau\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau} + \\{\\lambda, \\omega\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\omega}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d\\mu}{dt} &= \\{\\mu, z\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x} + \\{\\mu, \\lambda\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\lambda} + \\{\\mu, \\nu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\nu} + \\{\\mu, \\tau\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau} + \\{\\mu, \\omega\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\omega}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d\\nu}{dt} &= \\{\\nu, z\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x} + \\{\\nu, \\lambda\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\lambda} + \\{\\nu, \\mu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\mu} + \\{\\nu, \\tau\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau} + \\{\\nu, \\omega\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\omega}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} &= \\{\\tau, z\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x} + \\{\\tau, \\lambda\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\lambda} + \\{\\tau, \\mu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\mu} + \\{\\tau, \\nu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\nu} + \\{\\tau, \\omega\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\omega}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} &= \\{\\omega, z\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x} + \\{\\omega, \\lambda\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\lambda} + \\{\\omega, \\mu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\mu} + \\{\\omega, \\nu\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\nu} + \\{\\omega, \\tau\\} \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\((O^2)\\)\nif we put, for abridgement,\n\n\\[ \\{z, \\lambda\\} = \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta x'} \\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{\\delta x} - \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta y'} \\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{\\delta y} + \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\xi'} \\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{\\delta \\xi} - \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\eta'} \\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{\\delta \\eta} + \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\zeta'} \\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{\\delta \\zeta} - \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta \\eta'} \\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{\\delta \\eta} \\]  \n\n(P2.)\n\nand form the other symbols \\( \\{z, \\mu\\}, \\{\\lambda, z\\}, \\&c., \\) from this, by interchanging the letters.\n\nIt is evident that these symbols have the properties,\n\n\\[ \\{\\lambda, z\\} = -\\{z, \\lambda\\}, \\{z, z\\} = 0; \\]\n\n(184.)\n\nand it results from the principles of the 15th number, that these combinations \\( \\{z, \\lambda\\}, \\&c., \\) when expressed as functions of the elements, do not contain the time explicitly.\n\nThere are in general, by (184.), only 15 such distinct combinations for each of the \\( n - 1 \\) binary systems; but there would thus be, in all, \\( 15n - 15 \\), if they admitted of no further reductions: however, it results from the principles of the 16th number, that \\( 12n - 12 \\) of these combinations may be made to vanish by a suitable choice of the elements.

In general, it appears to be a useful rule, though not always followed by analysts, to employ the real radical symbol \\( \\sqrt{R} \\) only for positive quantities, unless the negative sign be expressly prefixed; and then \\( \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{r^2}} \\) will denote positive or negative unity, according as \\( r \\) is positive or negative. The arc given by its sine, in the expression of the element \\( \\omega \\), is supposed to be so chosen as to increase continually with the time.\n\n35. After these remarks on the notation, let us apply the formula (P²,) to calculate the values of the 15 combinations such as \\{z, λ\\}, of the 6 constants or elements (Q².).\n\nSince\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{(\\xi^2 + \\eta^2 + \\zeta^2)}, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (187.)\n\\]\n\nit is easy to perceive that the six combinations of the 4 first elements are as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\{z, λ\\} = 0, \\{z, µ\\} = 0, \\{z, ν\\} = 0, \\{λ, µ\\} = 0, \\{λ, ν\\} = 1, \\{µ, ν\\} = 0. \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (188.)\n\\]\n\nTo form the 4 combinations of these 4 first elements with \\( τ \\), we may observe, that this 5th element \\( τ \\), as expressed in (Q².), involves explicitly (besides the time) the distance \\( r \\), and the two elements \\( z, µ \\); but the combinations already determined show that these two elements may be treated as constant in forming the four combinations now sought; we need only attend, therefore, to the variation of \\( r \\), and if we interpret by the rule (P²) the symbols \\{z, r\\} \\{λ, r\\} \\{µ, r\\} \\{ν, r\\}, and attend to the equations (I²), we see that\n\n\\[\n\\{z, r\\} = 0, \\{λ, r\\} = 0, \\{µ, r\\} = -\\frac{dr}{dt}, \\{ν, r\\} = 0, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (189.)\n\\]\n\n\\( \\frac{dr}{dt} \\) being the total differential coefficient of \\( r \\) in the undisturbed motion, as determined by the equations (I²); and, therefore, that\n\n\\[\n\\{z, r\\} = 0, \\{λ, r\\} = 0, \\{µ, r\\} = 0, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (190.)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\{µ, r\\} = -\\frac{\\delta r}{\\delta r} \\frac{dr}{dt} = +\\frac{dr}{dt} = 1: \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (191.)\n\\]\n\nobserving that in differentiating the expressions of the elements (Q²,), we may treat those elements as constant, if we change the differentials of \\( \\xi \\eta \\xi' y' z' \\) to their undisturbed values. It remains to calculate the 5 combinations of these 5 elements with the last element \\( ω \\); which is given by (Q².) as a function of the distance \\( r \\), the coordinate \\( ζ \\), and the 4 elements \\( z, λ, µ, ν \\); so that we may employ this formula,\n\n\\[\n\\{e, ω\\} = \\frac{\\delta ω}{\\delta r} \\{e, r\\} + \\frac{\\delta ω}{\\delta ξ} \\{e, ξ\\} + \\frac{\\delta ω}{\\delta z} \\{e, z\\} + \\frac{\\delta ω}{\\δ λ} \\{e, λ\\} + \\frac{\\δ ω}{δ µ} \\{e, µ\\} + \\frac{\\δ ω}{δ ν} \\{e, ν\\}.

However, the relation (202.) shows that we may express this combination \\( \\{\\tau, \\omega\\} \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\{\\tau, \\omega\\} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta x} \\int_q^r \\Theta_r \\, dr + \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\mu} \\int_q^r \\Omega_r \\, dr,\n\\]\n\n\\( r \\) being an auxiliary and arbitrary quantity, which cannot really affect the result, but may be made to facilitate the calculation; or in other words, we may assign to the distance \\( r \\) any arbitrary value, not varying for infinitesimal variations of \\( z, \\mu \\), which may assist in calculating the value of the expression (199.). We may therefore suppose that the increase of distance \\( r - q \\) is small, and corresponds to a small positive interval of time \\( t - \\tau \\), during which the distance \\( r \\) and its differential coefficient \\( r' \\) are constantly increasing; and then after the first moment \\( \\tau \\), the quantity\n\n\\[\n\\Theta_r = \\frac{1}{r'}\n\\]\n\nwill be constantly finite, positive, and decreasing, during the same interval, so that its integral must be greater than if it had constantly its final value; that is,\n\n\\[\nt - \\tau = \\int_q^r \\Theta_r \\, dr > (r - q) \\Theta_r.\n\\]\n\nHence, although \\( \\Theta_r \\) tends to infinity, yet \\( (r - q) \\Theta_r \\) tends to zero, when by diminishing the interval we make \\( r \\) tend to \\( q \\); and therefore the following difference\n\n\\[\n\\int_q^r \\Omega_r \\, dr - \\frac{M + m}{M} \\int_q^r \\Theta_r \\, dr = \\frac{M + m}{M} \\int_q^r \\left( \\frac{x}{r^3} - \\frac{x}{q^3} \\right) \\Theta_r \\, dr,\n\\]\n\nwill also tend to 0, and so will also its partial differential coefficient of the first order, taken with respect to \\( \\mu \\). We find therefore the following formula for \\( \\{\\tau, \\omega\\} \\), (remembering that this combination has been shown to be independent of \\( r \\)),\n\n\\[\n\\{\\tau, \\omega\\} = r = q \\left\\{ \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta x} \\int_q^r \\Theta_r \\, dr + \\frac{M + m}{M} \\frac{x}{q^3} \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\mu} \\int_q^r \\Theta_r \\, dr \\right\\};\n\\]\n\nthe sign \\( r = q \\) implying that the limit is to be taken to which the expression tends when \\( r \\) tends to \\( q \\). In this last formula, as in (199.), the integral \\( \\int_q^r \\Theta_r \\, dr \\) may be considered as a known function of \\( r, q, z, \\mu \\), or simply of \\( r, q, z \\), if \\( \\mu \\) be eliminated by the first condition (186.) ; and since it vanishes independently of \\( z \\) when \\( r = q \\), it may be thus denoted:\n\n\\[\n\\int_q^r \\Theta_r \\, dr = \\varphi(r, q, z) - \\varphi(q, q, z),\n\\]\n\nthe form of the function \\( \\varphi \\) depending on the law of attraction or repulsion. This integral therefore, when considered as depending on \\( z \\) and \\( \\mu \\), by depending on \\( z \\) and \\( q \\), need not be varied with respect to \\( z \\), in calculating \\( \\{\\tau, \\omega\\} \\) by (207.), because\nits partial differential coefficient \\( \\left( \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta x} \\int_{q}^{r} \\Theta_r \\, dr \\right) \\), obtained by treating \\( q \\) as constant, vanishes at the limit \\( r = q \\); nor need it be varied with respect to \\( q \\), because, by (186.), \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta q}{\\delta x} + \\frac{M + m}{M} \\cdot \\frac{q^2}{q^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\delta q}{\\delta \\mu} = 0; \\quad . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Collecting now our results, and presenting for greater clearness each combination under the two forms in which it occurs when the order of the elements is changed, we have, for each binary system, the following thirty expressions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\{ x, \\lambda \\} &= 0, \\{ x, \\mu \\} = 0, \\{ x, v \\} = 0, \\{ x, \\tau \\} = 0, \\{ x, \\omega \\} = -1, \\\\\n\\{ \\lambda, x \\} &= 0, \\{ \\lambda, \\mu \\} = 0, \\{ \\lambda, v \\} = 1, \\{ \\lambda, \\tau \\} = 0, \\{ \\lambda, \\omega \\} = 0, \\\\\n\\{ \\mu, x \\} &= 0, \\{ \\mu, \\lambda \\} = 0, \\{ \\mu, v \\} = 0, \\{ \\mu, \\tau \\} = 1, \\{ \\mu, \\omega \\} = 0, \\\\\n\\{ v, x \\} &= 0, \\{ v, \\lambda \\} = -1, \\{ v, \\mu \\} = 0, \\{ v, \\tau \\} = 0, \\{ v, \\omega \\} = 0, \\\\\n\\{ \\tau, x \\} &= 0, \\{ \\tau, \\lambda \\} = 0, \\{ \\tau, \\mu \\} = -1, \\{ \\tau, v \\} = 0, \\{ \\tau, \\omega \\} = 0, \\\\\n\\{ \\omega, x \\} &= 1, \\{ \\omega, \\lambda \\} = 0, \\{ \\omega, \\mu \\} = 0, \\{ \\omega, v \\} = 0, \\{ \\omega, \\tau \\} = 0;\n\\end{align*}\n\\]  \n\n\\( \\{ R^2 \\} \\)\n\nso that the three combinations\n\n\\[\n\\{ \\mu, \\tau \\} \\{ \\omega, x \\} \\{ \\lambda, v \\}\n\\]\n\nare each equal to positive unity; the three inverse combinations\n\n\\[\n\\{ \\sigma, \\mu \\} \\{ x, \\omega \\} \\{ v, \\lambda \\}\n\\]\n\nare each equal to negative unity; and all the others vanish. The six differential equations of the first order, for the 6 varying elements of any one binary system \\((m, M)\\), are therefore, by \\((O^2)\\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nm \\frac{d \\mu}{d t} &= \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau}, & m \\frac{d \\tau}{d t} &= -\\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\mu}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d \\omega}{d t} &= \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x}, & m \\frac{d x}{d t} &= -\\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\omega}, \\\\\nm \\frac{d \\lambda}{d t} &= \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta v}, & m \\frac{d v}{d t} &= -\\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\lambda};\n\\end{align*}\n\\]  \n\n\\( \\{ S^2 \\} \\)\n\nand, if we still omit the variation of \\( t \\), they may all be summed up in this form for the variation of \\( H_2 \\),\n\n\\[\n\\delta H_2 = \\Sigma \\cdot m (\\mu' \\delta \\tau - \\tau' \\delta \\mu + \\omega' \\delta x - x' \\delta \\omega + \\lambda' \\delta v - v' \\delta \\lambda), \\quad . . .

It may be deduced by the general method from the formulæ of the 13th and 14th numbers, which give\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dH_1}{dt} = \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x_1} \\left( \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\eta} \\frac{\\delta x_1}{\\delta \\omega} - \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\omega} \\frac{\\delta x_1}{\\delta \\eta} \\right) + \\ldots + \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x_{6n}} \\left( \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\eta} \\frac{\\delta x_{6n}}{\\delta \\omega} - \\frac{\\delta H_1}{\\delta \\omega} \\frac{\\delta x_{6n}}{\\delta \\eta} \\right) \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (213.)\n\\]\n\n\\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{6n}\\) being any 6n elements of a system expressed as functions of the time and of the quantities \\(\\eta, \\omega\\); or more concisely by this special consideration, that \\(H_1 + H_2\\) is constant in the disturbed motion, and that in taking the first total differential coefficient of \\(H_2\\) with respect to the time, the elements may by \\((F^1)\\) be treated as constant. It is also a remarkable corollary of the general principles just referred to, but one not difficult to verify, that the first partial differential coefficient \\(\\frac{\\delta x_s}{\\delta t}\\) of any element \\(x_s\\), taken with respect to the time, may be expressed as a function of the elements alone, not involving the time explicitly.\n\n**On the essential distinction between the Systems of Varying Elements considered in this Essay and those hitherto employed by mathematicians.**\n\n37. When we shall have integrated the differential equations of varying elements \\((S^2)\\), we can then calculate the varying relative coordinates \\(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta\\), for any binary system \\((m, M)\\), by the rules of undisturbed motion, as expressed by the equations \\((I^2)\\), \\((Q^2)\\), or by the following connected formulæ:\n\n\\[\n\\xi = r \\left( \\cos \\theta + \\frac{\\lambda}{x} \\sin (\\theta - \\nu) \\sin \\nu \\right), \\\\\n\\eta = r \\left( \\sin \\theta - \\frac{\\lambda}{x} \\sin (\\theta - \\nu) \\cos \\nu \\right), \\\\\n\\zeta = \\frac{r}{x} \\sqrt{2 \\lambda x - \\lambda^2} \\sin (\\theta - \\nu): \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (V^2)\n\\]\nin which the distance \\( r \\) is determined as a function of the time \\( t \\) and of the elements \\( \\tau, z, \\mu \\), by the 5th equation (Q\\(^2\\)), and in which\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\omega + \\int_q^r \\frac{\\sqrt{M + m}}{M} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{x}{r^2} \\right) dr\n\\]\n\n\\( q \\) being still the minimum of \\( r \\), when the orbit is treated as constant, and being still connected with the elements \\( z, \\mu \\), by the first equation of condition (186.). In astronomical language, \\( M \\) is the sun, \\( m \\) a planet, \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta \\) are the heliocentric rectangular coordinates, \\( r \\) is the radius vector, \\( \\theta \\) the longitude in the orbit, \\( \\omega \\) the longitude of the perihelion, \\( \\nu \\) of the node, \\( \\theta - \\omega \\) is the true anomaly, \\( \\theta - \\nu \\) the argument of latitude, \\( \\mu \\) the constant part of the half square of undisturbed heliocentric velocity, diminished in the ratio of the sun’s mass (\\( M \\)) to the sum (\\( M + m \\)) of masses of sun and planet, \\( z \\) is the double of the areal velocity diminished in the same ratio, \\( \\lambda \\) is the versed sine of the inclination of the orbit, \\( q \\) the perihelion distance, and \\( \\tau \\) the time of perihelion passage. The law of attraction or repulsion is here left undetermined; for Newton’s law, \\( \\mu \\) is the sun’s mass divided by the axis major of the orbit taken negatively, and \\( z \\) is the square root of the semiparameter, multiplied by the sun’s mass, and divided by the square root of the sum of the masses of sun and planet. But the varying ellipse or other orbit, which the foregoing formulæ require, differs essentially (though little) from that hitherto employed by astronomers: because it gives correctly the heliocentric coordinates, but not the heliocentric components of velocity, without differentiating the elements in the calculation; and therefore does not touch, but cuts, (though under a very small angle,) the actual heliocentric orbit, described under the influence of all the disturbing forces.\n\n38. For it results from the foregoing theory, that if we differentiate the expressions (V\\(^2\\)) for the heliocentric coordinates, without differentiating the elements, and then assign to those new varying elements their values as functions of the time, obtained from the equations (S\\(^2\\)), and deduce the centrobaric components of velocity by the formulæ (I\\(^2\\)), or by the following:\n\n\\[\nx' = \\frac{M \\xi}{M + m}, \\quad y' = \\frac{M \\eta'}{M + m}, \\quad z' = \\frac{M \\zeta'}{M + m};\n\\]\n\nthen these centrobaric components will be the same functions of the time and of the new varying elements which might be otherwise deduced by elimination from the integrals (Q\\(^2\\)), and will represent rigorously (by the extension given in the theory to those last-mentioned integrals) the components of velocity of the disturbed planet \\( m \\), relatively to the centre of gravity of the whole solar system. We chose, as more suitable to the general course of our method, that these centrobaric components of velocity should be the auxiliary variables to be combined with the heliocentric coordinates, and to have their disturbed values rigorously expressed by the formulæ\nof undisturbed motion; but in making this choice it became necessary to modify these latter formulæ, and to determine a varying orbit essentially distinct in theory (though little differing in practice) from that conceived so beautifully by Lagrange. The orbit which he imagined was more simply connected with the heliocentric motion of a single planet, since it gave, for such heliocentric motion, the velocity as well as the position; the orbit which we have chosen is perhaps more closely combined with the conception of a multiple system, moving about its common centre of gravity, and influenced in every part by the actions of all the rest. Whichever orbit shall be hereafter adopted by astronomers, they will remember that both are equally fit to represent the celestial appearances, if the numeric elements of either set be suitably determined by observation, and the elements of the other set of orbits be deduced from these by calculation. Meantime mathematicians will judge, whether in sacrificing a part of the simplicity of that geometrical conception on which the theories of Lagrange and Poisson are founded, a simplicity of another kind has not been introduced, which was wanting in those admirable theories; by our having succeeded in expressing rigorously the differentials of all our own new varying elements through the coefficients of a single function: whereas it has seemed necessary hitherto to employ one function for the Earth disturbed by Venus, and another function for Venus disturbed by the Earth.\n\nIntegration of the Simplified Equations, which determine the new varying Elements.\n\n39.

If, then, we consider, for example, the first of these 8 combinations \\((\\tau, x, v)\\), as a function of\nall the $3n - 3$ elements $\\mu_i$, $\\omega_i$, $\\lambda_i$, and of their initial values $\\mu_{0,i}$, $\\omega_{0,i}$, $\\lambda_{0,i}$ involving also in general the time explicitly, we shall have the following forms for the $6n - 6$ rigorous integrals of the $6n - 6$ equations ($S^2$):\n\n$$m_i \\sigma_i = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\mu_i} (\\tau, z, v); \\quad m_i \\tau_{0,i} = -\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\mu_{0,i}} (\\tau, z, v);$$\n\n$$m_i z_i = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\omega_i} (\\tau, z, v); \\quad m_i z_{0,i} = -\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\omega_{0,i}} (\\tau, z, v);$$\n\n$$m_i v_i = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\lambda_i} (\\tau, z, v); \\quad m_i v_{0,i} = -\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\lambda_{0,i}} (\\tau, z, v);$$\n\nand in like manner we can deduce forms for the same rigorous integrals, from any one of the eight combinations ($Y^2$). The determination of all the varying elements would therefore be fully accomplished, if we could find the complete expression for any one of these 8 combinations.\n\n40. A first approximate expression for any one of them can be found from the form under which we have supposed $H_2$ to be put, namely, as a function of the elements and of the time, which may be thus denoted:\n\n$$H_2 = H_2 (t, z_1, \\lambda_1, \\mu_1, v_1, \\tau_1, \\omega_1, \\ldots z_{n-1}, \\lambda_{n-1}, \\mu_{n-1}, v_{n-1}, \\tau_{n-1}, \\omega_{n-1}); \\quad (A^3)$$\n\nby changing in this function the varying elements to their initial values, and employing the following approximate integrals of the equations ($S^2$),\n\n$$\\mu = \\mu_0 + \\frac{1}{m} \\int_0^t \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau_0} dt, \\quad \\tau = \\tau_0 - \\frac{1}{m} \\int_0^t \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\mu_0} dt,$$\n\n$$\\omega = \\omega_0 + \\frac{1}{m} \\int_0^t \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x_0} dt, \\quad z = z_0 - \\frac{1}{m} \\int_0^t \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\omega_0} dt,$$\n\n$$\\lambda = \\lambda_0 + \\frac{1}{m} \\int_0^t \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta v_0} dt, \\quad v = v_0 - \\frac{1}{m} \\int_0^t \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\lambda_0} dt. \\quad (B^3)$$\n\nFor if we denote, for example, the first of the 8 combinations ($Y^2$) by $G$, so that\n\n$$G = \\{\\tau, z, v\\}; \\quad (C^3)$$\n\nwe shall have, as a first approximate value,\n\n$$G_1 = \\int_0^t \\left\\{ \\sum \\left( \\tau_0 \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta \\tau_0} + z_0 \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta x_0} + v_0 \\frac{\\delta H_2}{\\delta v_0} \\right) - H_2 \\right\\} dt; \\quad (D^3)$$\n\nand after thus expressing $G_1$ as a function of the time, and of the initial elements, we can eliminate the initial quantities of the forms $\\tau_0$, $z_0$, $v_0$, and introduce in their stead the final quantities $\\mu$, $\\omega$, $\\lambda$, so as to obtain an expression for $G_1$ of the kind supposed in ($Z^2$), namely, a function of the time $t$, the varying elements $\\mu$, $\\omega$, $\\lambda$, and their initial values $\\mu_0$, $\\omega_0$, $\\lambda_0$. An approximate expression thus found may be corrected by a process of that kind, which has often been employed in this Essay for other similar purposes. For the function $G$, or the combination ($\\tau, z, v$), must satisfy rigorously, by ($Y^2$) ($A^3$), the following partial differential equation:\n\\[0 = \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta t} + H_2 \\left( t, \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega_1}, \\lambda_1, \\mu_1, \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\lambda_1}, \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\mu_1}, \\omega_1, \\frac{1}{m_2} \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega_2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{n-1} \\right); \\ldots \\quad (E^3)\\]\n\nand each of the other analogous functions or combinations \\(Y^2\\) must satisfy an analogous equation: if then we change \\(G\\) to \\(G_1 + G_2\\), and neglect the squares and products of the coefficients of the small correction \\(G_2\\), \\(G_1\\) being a first approximation such as that already found, we are conducted, as a second approximation, on principles already explained, to the following expression for this correction \\(G_2\\):\n\n\\[G_2 = - \\int_0^t \\left\\{ \\frac{\\delta G_1}{\\delta t} + H_2 \\left( t, \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\delta G_1}{\\delta \\omega_1}, \\lambda_1, \\mu_1, \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\delta G_1}{\\delta \\lambda_1}, \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\delta G_1}{\\delta \\mu_1}, \\omega_1, \\ldots \\right) \\right\\} dt; \\quad (F^3)\\]\n\nwhich may be continually and indefinitely improved by a repetition of the same process of correction. We may therefore, theoretically, consider the problem as solved; but it must remain for future consideration, and perhaps for actual trial, to determine which of all these various processes of successive and indefinite approximation, deduced in the present Essay and in the former, as corollaries of one general Method, and as consequences of one central Idea, is best adapted for numeric application, and for the mathematical study of phenomena.",
