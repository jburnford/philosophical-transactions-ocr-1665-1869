Extract of a Letter from Maurice Johnson, Esq; to Emanuel Mendez da Costa, F.R.S. dated at Spalding in Lincolnshire, 25th August 1750.

Read Nov. 1. On Thursday the 23d Instant, the Air 1750. mild and calm, no Wind stirring, the Sun shining bright, at about 45 Minutes past 6 o’Clock in the Morning, a Shock of an Earthquake was sensibly felt here, and hereabout, attended with a loud Noise, and Crack (as some call it): This was perceived both Southward, and Northwardly, for some Seconds. A Gentleman from Newark in Nottinghamshire, N.E. of us about 30 Miles, says it was also felt there.
