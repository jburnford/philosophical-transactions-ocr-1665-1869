Part of a Letter from Mr. Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S. to Dr. Hans Sloane, R. S. Secr. concerning some Roman Coins found in Yorkshire.\n\nOn Saturday last Mr. Arthington obliged me with the perusal of some Roman Coins, which a few days ago were Plowed up at Cookridge, in some Grounds he purchased of Mr. Kirk Junior, and are a confirmation of the Conjecture of his Ingenious Father (the late Thomas Kirk Esq;) that the Roman Via Vicinalis (which comes from the great Military Road upon Bramham-Moor) passed from that Station at Adellocum (of which there is an Account No. 282. of the Philosoph. Transact.) thro' these Grounds to Ilkley.\n\nThere are but few of them, (not above Twenty that the Servants confess to) but those mostly very fair: The eldest he has is of Domitian, An. Urb. Cond. 846. which you know falls in with the Year of our Lord 95; his Head\nHead is surrounded with this Inscription, IMPerator CAESar DOMITianus AUGustus GERManicus P. M. (Pontifex Maximus) T R. P. Tribunitia Potestate) XIII. The Reverse shews he was then saluted Emperor the 22d time, IMP. XXII. COS (Consul.) XVI CENS. PP. (Pater Patriæ,) the Flavian Family particularly affected the Title of Censors, and Domitian is the last Emperor who has that Title upon his Medals; the Figure upon this Reverse has a Helmet upon the Head, and a Spear in the Right Hand.\n\nThe next is of Nerva's,\n\nIMP. NERVA. CAES. AUG. PM. TRP. COS. Reverse CONCORDIA EXERCITVVM. Dextræ junctæ.\n\nThe next Seven are of Trajan's, but all different,\n\nIMP. CAES. NERVA. TRAIANVS. GERM. Rev. PM. TRP. COS. III. PP. figura stolata stans, sinistra cornucopiæ.\n\nThe next has the same Inscription, save that it it was in his 4th Consulship, and has figura galeata cum haste.\n\nIMP. TRAIANO. AUG. GER. DAC. PM. TRP. Rev. COS. V. PP. SPQR. (Senatus Populusque Romanus) OPTIMO PRINCipi. Pacis stantis typus, dextra facem admoventis spoliis, ea conflagraturus, sinistra cornucopiæ tenentis. (exurge) PAX.\n\nIMP. CAES. NER. TRAIANO. OPTIMO. AVG. GER. DACico. Rev. PM. TRP. COS. VI. PP. SPQR. Deus Genius stans, dextra pateram.\n\nIMP. TRAIANVS. AVG. GER. DAC. PM. TRP. Rev. COS. VI. SPQR. OPTIMO. PRINC. fig. stolata.\n\nIMP.\nIMP. TRAIANO. OPTIMO. AVG. GER. DAC. PM. TR. P. P. Rev. COS. VI. PP. SPQR. figura foliata dextra Caduceum, sinistra cornucopiae.\n\nIMP. TRAIANO. AVG. GER. DAC. PM. TRP COS. VI. PP. Rev. SPQR. OPTIMO. PRINCIPI. Columna cochlidis Trajani.\n\nThe rest that are legible, are of Hadrian's, viz.\n\nHADRIANVS. AVGVSTVS. Rev. COS. III. Victoria cum Palma.\n\nThe other has upon the Reverse,\n\nFELICITATI. AVGVSTI. Above the Navis Praetoria, and below it COS. III. PP.\n\nThese are all of Silver: There was a large one of Copper of the Emperor Domitian,\n\nIMP. CAES. DOMIT. AVG. GERM. . . . but the Reverse was not legible.\n\nJohn Dynley of Bramhope Esq; has also three, one with FIDES EXERCITVM, one of Titus's, and one of Trajan's with Dacia Captive under a Trophy, but I want the Inscriptions; all the rest are in the Possession of the Ingenious Cyril Arthington of Arthington Esq; the Lord of the Mannor, who obliged me with one, for Lecturing upon the rest, the Figure whereof I send you, it being upon a remarkable Occasion, and not mentioned in Oeco (at least in my Edition of that Author;) 'tis inscribed HADRIANVS AVG. COS. III. PP. Rev. RESTITVTORI HISPANIÆ. This was upon his peaceable settling of Affairs in that his Native Country; Spain is represented here as a Woman with a Branch in her right\nright Hand to denote her Fruitfulness, kneeling before the Emperor, who kindly takes her by the Hand to raise her up.\n\nBy these it appears, that this Station flourished when the Roman Empire was in its prime; and there being none of a later Date, makes it probable, that it perished in some of the Insurrections of the Native Brigantes, about Severus's Time, as it was conjectured from the form of the Letter A in the Inscriptions upon the Funerary Monuments formerly accounted for. (Philosoph. Transact. No. 282.)\n\nLeeds, April 19, 1708.\n\nIII. Part of a Letter from Orlando Bridgman Esq; F.R.S. to Capt. Wine, giving an Account of a Storm of Thunder and Lightning that happen'd at Ipswich, July 16, 1708.\n\nIpswich, July 20, 1708.\n\nTHERE happen'd here on the 16th past, a most Violent Storm of Thunder and Lightning, the Effects of which have been both wonderful and dismal; it began about Six to be perceived at some distance, and arose in the South West: I happened then to be on the highest Eminence about this Town, from whence I could very plainly distinguish the working of the Storm, and can't but take notice to you of one thing I thought very",
