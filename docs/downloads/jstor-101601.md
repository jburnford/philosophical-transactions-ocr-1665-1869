An Accompt from Paris, in two Letters to the Publisher, dated July 5. and July 19. 1670. concerning the Earlier Discovery of the same New Star, which is described in the Precedent Letter.

The Letter of July 5. 1670. relateth, that a Carthusian of Dyon, having from time to time for divers years taken particular notice of what might occur remarkable in the Constellations of Cygnus and Cassiopea, did on the 20th of December A. 1669. discover a Star of the Third magnitude, beneath the Head of Cygnus, situated in the Section of the two straight lines, one of which goeth from Lyra to the nearest of the Quadrangle in the Dolphin, and the other from the Eagle to the Star, which is on the top of the upper wing of Cygnus.

That of July 19. 1670. gives this Accompt, viz. That there was much discourse at Paris about the New Star near the Beak of Cygnus, first discover'd by a Carthusian of Dyon, call'd Antelme, who sent the news of it to M. L'Abbé Marlotte, one of the Royal Academy there, who had communicated it to the rest: That they all agree, 'tis a New Star; though Mons. B. opposed it at first, affirming it to be in Bayerus's Tables. That they prove that Star in Bayerus to be another; giving, for distinction, these Measures.

The bright Star ad Rostrum Cygni its Ascensio recta 289°.22'.0'.
Declinatio Borealis 27°.19'.20.
But this New Star's Ascensio Recta is 293°.33'.0.
Declinatio Borealis 26°.33'.20.
Longitudo 1°.55'33".
Latitudo 47°.28'.10.
It's Dist. from that ad Rostrum Cygni towards Jaculum 3°.47'.
