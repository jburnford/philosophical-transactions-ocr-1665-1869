14 Poles, or $69\frac{1}{2}$ English miles and 14 Poles; 8 Furlongs to a mile, and 40 Poles to a Furlong. Which being compared to that measure of a Degree, which is deliver'd in the above-mention'd French Discourse, will be found to come very near it, they finding 73 miles fere, at 5000 feet to an English mile, which make 365000 feet; whereas the $69\frac{1}{2}$ English miles and 14 Poles, found by Mr. Norwood, amount to 367200 feet, reckoning 5280 feet to an English mile, as the true measure of it is; whence the difference between these two measures appears to be no more than 2200 feet, which is not half an English mile by 440 feet.

If any one desire to know further the whole Circumference, as also the Diameter and Semidiameter of the said Terraqueous Globe, according to this measure, he will easily find,

The Circumference to be $25056$ fere.
The Diameter, $7966$
The Semidiameter, $3983$
