Lhwyd to Dr. Tancred Robinson; giving an Account of some uncommon Plants growing about Pensans and St. Ives in Cornwall.\n\nPensans, Sept. 22. 1706.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have met with no Birds or Fish, since our coming hither, that I suspect for undescribed: Only two or three Stella, and some other Exanguia marina have occur'd, which I have not seen before on our British Coasts.\n\nWe have also met with the Capillus Veneris versus in abundance on the Sea Cliffs about St. Ives. 2. Dr. Shepherd's Scrophularia Scorodonica folio. 3. Blattaria lutea; an Intea minor Park? But the Leaves of ours are not jagged: Also all the Plants mentioned by Mr Ray to grow here; excepting the Gnaphalium marinum, which should grow by this Town; and two or three more, which being at some distance, we have not looked for.\n\nWe have also found some Fuci, which perhaps may be new: And I am told the Fishermen sometimes take up the Corallina marina reticulata by their Hooks; but I have not yet seen one of them.\n\nE. LHWYD.",
