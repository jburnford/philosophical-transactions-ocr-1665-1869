Prodr. 150. descr.\n\nThis is a beautiful Fern, differing from our true Maidenhair of the Shops, in having its Branches more spacious and curl'd. Cornutus first discovered it in Canada, since which it has been found in Virginia and Maryland. I have observ'd it at the Bishop of London's at Fulham, Place, and in our Physick Garden at Chelsea.\n\nCommon Ceterach, Ray 139.\n\nAsplenium C.B. in Matth. 646. fig. opt.

It grows very tall in the Bishop of London's Garden at Fulham. They are brought to us from Spain, Cyprus, and other hot Countries.\n\nBobarts Drank or Haver-grass.\n\nFestuca Avenacea sterilis spicis erectis Bobarti, Ray Syn. 237. edit. 2. p. 261. 3. Pluk. Tab. 299. fig. 2.\n\nMr Jacob Bobart first discovered this in the Hedges beyond Botley near Oxford, who hath lately sent it to the Physick Garden at Chelsea.\n\nFile Catstail Grass, Ray H. Pl.

Gramen pumilum hirsutum spicâ purpuro-argenteâ molli, Ray 1265. 5. Syn. 182. 4. ed. 250. 3.\n\nThis is thicker, softer, and more loose than our common Crested Grass, and in spike more nearly resembles our yellow Spring Grass: Dr Zuinger, Physician, and Son to the famous Professor of that Name, a very accurate Botanist, hath lately, amongst other curious Plants, sent me this Grass, which he gathered on the hilly Meadows about Basil, where Caspar Bauhine first discovered it. He says it grows with the common, but more rarely; the same found in the Woods there, he observes to sport or vary in its spike, viz. some more loose and greenish, others thicker and yellowish; the Leaves and Stalks in some are hairy, in others smooth. Dr John Jacob Scheutzer, that Curious Naturalist, has also observed it about Zurich, and from whom I received it by the Name of Gramen cum caudâ Muris purpurascente aliquatennus simile, l. B. 2. l. 18. p. 473. c. 106. So that here is 3 Plants reduced to one. Mr Dale and Mr Doody, who first observed it in England, and communicated it to Mr Ray and Dr Pluknet, took it for a new Grass. John Bauhine also, who found it in the sandy Fields and Paths near Mont-belgard, knew not that it was the same which his Brother Casper Bauhine had describ'd long before in his Prodomus, and first observ'd in the Woods about Cliben near Basil, from whence I lately received it.\n\nPainted Grass, or Ladies Laces, Ray 1281. 9.\n\nGramen Paniculatum fol. variegato C B.

I observed this the last Summer with the Curious Mr Charles Du Bois, amongst many other rare Plants in his Gardens at Mitcham.\n\nScate-tail'd Sicilian Amaranth, Ray 203. 7.\n\nCadelari Sicula Parietaria folijs Nobis. Amaranthus Siculus spicatus, radice perenni Bocc. 16. Tab. 9. Pluk. Tab. 260. fig. 2.\nThis is a new Species of *Amaranth*, which the *Malabars* call *Cadelari* with long slender Spikes, and its Seed Vessels hanging downwards. *Boccone* first discovered this about *Catanea* in *Sicily*, Mr *Alex. Brown* at the *Maderas*, and Dr *Sloane* in the Ditches about St. *Jago* in *Jamaica*.\n\nSilver scaled, *Knot-grass*, Ray 185. 5.\n\n*Polygonum minus candicans CB*, 281. 5. *Phyt*. 550. 3. *minus candicans supinum Bot.

Fig.\n\nThis spreads like our common *Knot-grass*, but differs in having many white skinny Membranes amongst its Leaves. Dr *Boerhave* marks this as an *Indigena* of *Holland*. Its very common on the Sea Coasts of *Spain* and *Languedoc*.\n\n**Knotty Knavell.**\n\n*Knavell nodosum Herniarie facie Nobis. an Polygonum capitulis ad genicula echinatis Bocc*. 40. Tab. 20.\n\nThis Plant does not well agree with *Boccone*s Figure or Description, his having many Leaves at each joint, and but 3 or 4 Branches from one Root; whereas this is as branched as common *Knot-grass*, and generally but one Leaf at each whirl, except towards the tips, where they are there sometimes 3 or 4. I observed this at Mr *Fairchild*s Garden at *Hoxton* from Seed, which Dr *Sherard* sent to the Reverend Mr *Wm. Stonestreet*.\n\n**Sect. IV:** Plants with *Double* and *Radiated Flowers*.\n\n**Jagged, Purple, Lettuce.**\n\n*Lactuca altissima*, folio *Sonchi laciniato*, fl. parvo caeruleo *Boerhave* Ind. Plant. *Hort. Lugd. Bat*. 3. p. 21.\nIts *Leaves* very like the *Jagged Sow-Thistles*, with Spoakey Tufts of Purple *Flowers* like the *Chondrilla carulea laciniata*. We are obliged to Dr Boerhave Botanick Professor of Leyden, for the Knowledge of this Specious Plant.\n\n**Frosty-headed Hawkbeard.**\n\n*Hieracium Aphacoides Cichorei folio, calyce glauco.*\n\nIts lower *Leaves* are deeply cut like *Succory*, the Barbulæ, or Stalk leaves, are broad at the Base, with a Beard or two on each side, ending in a plain sharp Point, the Peculiarity in this Plant it its *glaucose* or *frosty Heads*, each Stalk ending in a single midling Flower. It heads from June till August.\n\n**Great Egyptian Sow-thistle.**\n\n*Sonchus Ægyptiacus Giganteus.*\n\nThe lower *Leaves* are very long, and deeply jagged, those which ride the Stalk are large and round at the Base, covering each side of the Stalk, and in all its parts much larger than our *Common Sow thistle*. This was raised from Seed which Mons. Vaillant sent me this Spring from the Royal Garden at Paris.\n\n**Indian Sowthistle with curl’d Seed.**\n\n*Sonchus Orientalis Lactucae folio, fl. luteo, semine ele- ganter crenato Boerhave 12. p. 23.*\n\nThis very much resembles the *Crepis Dalech Lugd 562.* but that the Flowers are larger, and Stalk swelled under the Calyx, which is composed of 2 or 3 ranges of broad pointed smooth Scales. The *Heads* turgid when the Seed are ripe, which are finely notch’d and curl’d. It *Flowers* from July till November.\n\n**Tangier Sowthistle, Ray 1857,** *Sonchus Tingitanus Papaveris folio El.

It grows wild in Narbone, Italy, Sicily, &c.\n\n*Smirna Wooly Flea-burr.*\n\n*Baccharis Smirnea folio subrotundo pannoso.* After *Verbasci folio, flor. minoribus nudis Sherard.*\n\nThis elegant Plant grows about a foot high; from a thick root, spreads many wooly, roundish, pointed thick *Leaves*, the largest somewhat more than an Inch long, but not quite so broad. These stand on woolly pedicles, the longest about an Inch and a half, above the midst of the Flower Stalk, come single yellowish naked *Heads*, each with a small Leaf, and both Stalkless, these branch a little towards the Top. Dr Sherrard, that accurate Botanist, and now *Consul of Smyrna*, sent me a Specimen from thence, since which I have seen it with the *Duchess of Beaufort* at *Chelsea*, who was pleased to make me a Present of it for our *Physick Garden*.\n\n**White Canada Folesfoot.** *Ray* 292. 3.\n\n*Cacalia Americana Park.* 1221. fig. 2. *Conyza Americana Urtice folio, flore albo El.

It Flowers in August and September. I find this Plant in a *Hortus Siccus*, made by that curious Botanist Mr John Banister, of the Plants he collected in the Physick Garden at Oxford, before he went to Virginia. The lower Leaves in\nin this Specimen are almost round, which very well agrees with Mr Bobart's Description, as does the rest of the Plant, with his and my own.\n\n**SECT. VI.

It Flowers in August and September. Whether this Herb be described by any Author I am not certain. The 3d sort of Clusius his 2d Horminum, figured in his Stirpium Pannon. Histor. p. 582. would very well resemble it, were its lower Leaves finely serrated, instead of being waved. This Plant has been an old Inhabitant in Gardens, for I find a Specimen of it in the 1st Vol. p. 116. pl. 43. of Archbishop Sandcroft's Collection of Padua Plants, which I guess to be made about A.D. 1650.

The whole Plant is clammy, and its branches tangle much. Mr. Samuel Daniel, Surgeon, first brought me this Plant from Rhodes, and the Seeds of it I communicated to Mr Charles du Bois, with whom it flowered A.D. 1697. and this last Summer again at Chelsea.

It was first discovered by Dr. Mycone, a Spanish Physician, on and near the Pyrenees, in shady moist mountainous Places, who says, a distill'd Water of it is very efficacious in breaking the Stone in the Kidneys or Bladder, and that the Spaniards drink the same against Coughs, for which reason they call it Terva Tussera, and also Pelada from the plenty of its Leaves.\n\nSECT.
