are not Hexangular like Crystals, but oftentimes of the form of a Chissile.

I saw a little Particle of Crystal, which tho very small, I could perceive to be of a Triangular shape, two Angles of it being a little larger than the third, as is represented in Fig. 13. between N and O.

I saw also some Salt Figures like Fig. 8. between A and B, but they had a thickness in 'em which was visible to the Eye, besides a great many other irregular Salt Particles, which were so very numerous in a small quantity of Water, that I was astonisht at it.

I caused the Water, that almost always surrounds the Salt Particles, to exhale leisurely by the warmth of a Candle, and then I could discover a great many coagulated small Salts without any visible figure.

II. A Register of the Weather for the year 1692, kept at Oates in Essex. By Mr John Locke.

I Herewith send you the Copy of my Register of the Weather, from the 9th of Decemb. 1691. to the end of the year 1692. It is fit I explain a little to you some things in the Table, for the better understanding of it.

The first Column, having D at the top, contains the day of the month.

That with H, the hour of the day, which beginning from one of the clock in the morning, I count round in one continued series to 24, which is 12 a clock at night.

The Column Ther is that of the Thermoscope, which was a sealed one, whereof you will find a larger account hereafter.
The Column Bar marks the height of the Mercury in the Baroscope.

The first number is the inches of its height, the second number marks the 20th parts of an inch above that inch marked by the first number.

The Column Hg. is that which marks the moisture of the Air. The Instrument I used was the beard of a Wild Oat, of which each turn was divided into sixteen degrees.

The Column of the Wind mark'd the point the Wind was in, but not always exactly, because the Weather-cock visible out of my Window was stiff, and turn'd not easily, nor was the House it stood on situate exactly East and West; so that it was not easy by the standing of the Weather-cock to know exactly the point of the Wind: Wherefore I contented myself to set down barely one of the 4 cardinal points, when the Wind was pretty near it; and when it was more remote, the two cardinal points between which it was, putting the Letter of the cardinal point first to which it was nearest; as when the Wind was between the South and the West, if it were nearer the West than the South, I writ W.S. and so of the rest.

I marked besides the force of the Wind, which I divided into four degrees. 1. When it just moved the Leaves. 2. When it blew a pretty fresh gale. 3. When it was a hard and whistling Wind. 4. When it blew a storm. Though these divisions were not made with that exactness as they might have been, had one had an Instrument on purpose, yet they may give some help to those who would make observations from such Registers as these. (o) was when there was not Wind enough to move a Leaf as I could see.

As to the Weather, Cloudy signifies more of the Sky (visible out of the Windows of my Study, which were East and South) cover'd with Clouds, than not. Fair the contrary.
Between when it was uncertain whether more of the Sky was cover'd or clear. Cover'd when no part of the clear Sky appear'd. Close when the Sky was cover'd with one uniform thick Cloud.

I have often thought that if such a Register as this, or one that were better contriv'd, with the help of some Instruments that for exactness might be added, were kept in every County in England, and so constantly published, many things relating to the Air, Winds, Health, Fruitfulness, &c. might by a sagacious man be collected from them, and several Rules and Observations concerning the extent of Winds and Rains, &c. be in time establish'd, to the great advantage of Mankind. Whether you will think it worth the Royal Society's consideration and promotion, I leave it to you. From this solitary one there is little to be collected. The pains is so little, that I indulg'd my Curiosity, when it cost me the writing not so much as a line a day. For, though besides the ordinary Observation, which I set down commonly every morning, there seldom happen'd any Rain, Snow, or other remarkable change, which I did not set down. But as you see, a few Letters and Figures do it; such as it is I send it you, and if it may be of use to anyone I shall be glad.

N.B. That the Thermoscope mark'd 4, which I made use of till Mar. 7. 1701. was one of those sold by Mr Tompion, wherein o mark'd Temperate, and the Figures from thence increasing both upwards and downwards, shew'd the increase of Heat and Cold from Temperate. Sept. 22. 1701. I began to use a new Yealed Thermoscope, adjusted to a Scale made by Mr John Patrick in the Old Bailey, who places o at the top, supposing it to be the Heat under the line, and so the Figures increase downwards, with the increase of Cold. Temperate being placed at 45. This Thermoscope is marked 5 in my Register.
