S.; containing the Discovery of a Comet.\n\nRead November 27, 1783.\n\nSIR,\n\nYork, Nov. 22, 1783.\n\nI have the pleasure of informing you, that I discovered a comet on the 19th instant, and have made the following observations on it.\n\n| Date     | R.A. | North Decl. |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| 1783 h.  |      |             |\n| Nov 19   | 11   | 41          |\n| 15       |      | 6           |\n| 20       | 10   | 40          |\n| 54       |      | 0           |\n\nNov. 21. This night I saw the comet where I expected it, according to the above determinations; but could not observe it with an instrument.\n\nThe comet looks like a nebula, with a diameter of about two minutes of a degree. The nucleus being very faint, is seen with some difficulty, when the wires of the instrument are illuminated. It is not visible with an opera glass.",
