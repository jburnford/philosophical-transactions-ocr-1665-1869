As to the ill success which at times hath attended the taking of Laudanum, our Author ascribeth that either to the unskilful preparation, or the unseasonable and indiscreet exhibition of it. In the preparation he observeth, that the malignity that is in Opium, is best corrected by Alcaly's, as having the force of taming that Narcotic sulphur, contain'd in it; agreeing herein with Heimont's Maxim, Omne Narcoticum perit in Alcaly.

Since the printing of the foregoing particulars, there came to hand the New Observations above mentioned, of the Spots of the Sun, in Print, made at the Royal Academy in Paris, the 11th, 12th, and 13th of August, 1671. (ft. n.) by Signor Cassini; who intimateth at the end of his French Narrative concerning the same (which is intended to be English'd for the next Tract,) that from about Sept. 4th, until Sept. 18. (ft. n.) it will be worth while to observe, whether the same Spots after they have passed over the upper Hemisphere of the Sun, which is hidden to us, will not return again and appear in its apparent Disque.

The same Spots have been observed, as by a Letter from Dr. Fogelius at Hamburg we were also very lately inform'd, at Sea near the Tiefel, by Mr. Picard, one of the Royal Parisian Philosophers, namely Aug. 3. (ft. n.) and some of the following days; as also at Hamburg the 7th, 8th, 9th of August, (ft. n.) Of which more also by the next opportunity.

What we have to add now (which must not be defer'd) is the Prediction, made by the same Signor Cassini, of the Eclipses of the Satellites of Jupiter, calculated for Uraniburg, and annexed here, to the end that our Astronomers, having reduced them to our Latitude and Longitude, may also observe the same.
