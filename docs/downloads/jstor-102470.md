IV. An Account of a Lamb suckled by a Weather Sheep for several Months after the Death of the Ewe. Communicated by Mr. Tho. Kirke from Cookridge in Yorkshire.

Cookridge, Septemb. 23. 1694.

Honoured Sir,

The other day I dined with a Neighbouring Gentleman (Sir William Lowther) where I met with something that to us seemed Remarkable: He had this Year an Ewe that had two Lambs, and she dying, left them young to shift for themselves; one of them was entertained by a Weather Sheep (*Ovis castratus*) amongst above an Hundred other Sheep: The Lamb suckt the Weather, and brought him to Milk, and was maintained by him all this Summer, till about a Month ago that he was weaned. The Weather was brought up to us, and we saw his Udder, each side whereof was about the bigness of a Hens-Egg, and he had two considerable Teats. I saw Milk spurted out of them, to a yard or two's distance, notwithstanding the Lamb had been taken from him so long, &c.
