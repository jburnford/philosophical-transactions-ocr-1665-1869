XLIV. An Account of the said Comet; by Mr. Mark Day.

SIR, Lowick, near Thrapston, Northamptonshire.

Read Jan. 17, 1760. I had the pleasure last night, about five o'clock, to observe a comet in the southern hemisphere, near the northmost extremity of the river Eridanus, tending its course towards Pegasus, and, near as I can guess, it will cross the ecliptic about $20^\circ$ in Aries. It moves one degree in less than one hour and half; but seems too hasty to give the astronomers leave to make many observations upon it, unless the weather prove favourable. If there has been any accurate observation thereupon, I would gladly know; but if it has not been taken notice of, then I hope the above will be acceptable from,

SIR,

Your very humble servant,

Jan. 10, 1760. Mark Day.

It passed the meridian about 9.
