This skin would have small holes in it, through which a moisture did issue in small drops, which being wip'd away, and the water continued to be dropp'd warm out of the mouth, the holes would diminish, and at last be all quite healed up.\n\nFor the Eye-waters, I conceived them more strongly tensive, and clearing the Eyes; and they had a rough smartness, as if they carryed Sand or Gravel into the Eye.\n\nI have known and try'd three or four healing Fountains of late discovery, or of no old fame that I could hear of.\n\nI did once put rich pearl for some days in a vessel of water, to try whether the water would acquire a healing vertue; but my Experiments were interrupted. I had in my thoughts many other ways of Tryal; which I may resume hereafter.\n\nA farther Accompt of the Vitriolate-water, mention'd Num. 18 p. 323. Together with some other Particulars touching Waters.\n\nThis comes from the same hand as follows;\n\nI formerly mention'd to you, that, if that Pool of Mr. Philip's, which seems to be of Vitriolate-water, were on my ground, I would drain it, and search the head of the Spring, pursuing the source, till I could well discern, through what lay of Earth or Gravel it does pass. Now I shall tell you, that I have taken order for the further tryal of the said Water, by boiling a greater quantity in a Furnace, &c. But just as we were in readiness for the tryal, a stream of Rain-water fell into the Pool, and so discourag'd us for the present. I have also taken a course to turn the falling Waters aside, and to drain the Pool, that we may see, what the Native Springs (whether one or more) may be. Of which more hereafter.\n\nI wish (so he goes on) we had a full Accompt of our Salt-springs at Droft-wych near Worcester, and at Nant-wych in Chester (what other Salt-Springs we have in England, I know not;) It\nIt should be inquired, at what distance they are from the Seas, or from Salt-fluxes, from Hills, and how deep in the Vales? What the weight? Whether in droughts or long Frosts the proportion of Salt or weight increaseth? Whether the Earth near the Springs, or in their passage hath any peculiar ferment, or produceth a blackishness, if it rests, after it is well drained.\n\nInquiries for Turkey.\n\nThough many Relations and Descriptions of Turkey be extant in Print, yet they leave in many a desire of fuller information in the following particulars, lately drawn up, for the most part by Mr. H. and recommended to an Ingenious Gentleman, bound for that Country; and desired also to be taken notice off by others, that may have occasion to visit the same.\n\n1. In what part of Turkey the * Rusma is to be found; and in what quantity? Whether the Turks employ it to any other Uses, besides that of the taking away of Hair? Whether there be differing kinds of it? How it is used to take off hair, and how to get store of it.\n\n2. Whether the Turks do not only take opium themselves for strength and courage, but also give it to their Horses, Camels and Dromedaries, for the same purpose, when they find them tired and faint in their travelling? What is the greatest Dose, any men are known to have taken of Opium? and how prepared?\n\n3. What effects are observed from their use, not only of Opium (already mention'd) but also of Coffee, Bathing, shaving their Heads, using Rice; and why they prefer that which grows not unless water'd, before Wheat, &c.?\n\n4. How their Damasco-steel is made and temper'd?\n\n5. What is their way of dressing and making Leather, which though thin and supple, will hold out water?\n\n6. What method they observe in breeding those excellent Horses, they are so much famed for?\n\n7. Whether they be so skilful in Poisoning, as is said; and how their Poisons are curable?\n\n8. How",
