III. A Letter from Dr. Franklyn, F. R. S., to the Astronomer Royal; containing an Observation of the Transit of Mercury over the Sun, November 9th 1769: By John Winthrop, Esq; F. R. S. Hollisian Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Cambridge, New England.

Dear Sir,

Craven-street, Feb. 12, 1770.

I HAVE just received a letter from Mr. Winthrop, dated Dec. 7, containing the following account, viz.

"On Thursday the 9th of November, I had an opportunity of observing a transit of Mercury. I had carefully adjusted my clock to the apparent time, by correspondent altitudes of the Sun, taken with the quadrant for several days before, and with the same reflecting telescope as I used for the transit of Venus*.

clear. This transit compleats three periods of
46 years, since the first observation of Gassendi at
Paris, in 1631."

I am, SIR,

With great esteem,

Your most obedient servant,

B. Franklin.
