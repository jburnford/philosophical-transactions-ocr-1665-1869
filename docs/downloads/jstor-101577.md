2. That both begin their Philosophy from the Consideration of Light, as the first Effect of the Distinction of things from one another.

3. That both do attribute a Fluidity to the Heavens; yet so, as that Des-Chartes enlarges upon the particular Disposition of the Constituent parts of that Body, which Moses is silent of.

4. That the Cartesian Doctrine of the Distinction of the Earth from the Waters and Air, and of the proper Constitution of each of them, is not inconsistent with that of Genesis.

5. That the growth and variety of Vegetables, and the causes thereof, assigned by Des-Chartes, do not disagree with the same Sacred History.

6. That the Cartesian Doctrine of the Constitution and Use of the Luminaries and Fix't Stars, and their difference from the Planets and Comets; as also that of the Motion of the Earth about the Sun, and its own Axis, and the deflexion of its Axis from the Parallelisme to the Axis of the Ecliptick, and the keeping in a perpetual Parallelisme to itself, is very rational; and consequently not incongruous to that of the Divine Philosopher.

7. That there is a great agreement between Moses and Des-Cartes in assigning the difference between the Life of Beasts, and the Soul of Man; forasmuch as both teach, that the former consists in the Blood; Which Des-Chartes further declaring, teacheth, That the Blood heated in the Heart and subtilized into spirits, is diffused from the Heart and Arteries through the Brain into the Nerves and Muscles, and by a continual influx into the same, moves the whole and wonderfully contrived Frame of the Body and all the parts thereof; according to the various impulses and actions of Objects upon them: But that the Soul of Man consists in Thinking and Understanding, whereby principally Man resembleth his Creator, to whose Image he is made. Which difference is confirm'd by what Moses saith, that God commanded the Earth to bring forth Living Creatures or Beasts, as well as he commanded the Earth to produce Plants; whereas, after he had formed Man out of the Earth, he is said to have breath'd into him the Breath of Life, whereby Man became a Living Soul, not only Living and Moving, but a Soul too, that is, perceiving and knowing.

The third Book, promised in the Contents, we must refer to the next, for want of room.
