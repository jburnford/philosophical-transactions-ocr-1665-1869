same variable, then \( dy, dx, dw, \ldots \) are expressions proportional to the derived functions of \( y, z, w, \ldots \) whatever may be the variable of which they are common functions. Hence \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{Dy}{Dz} \); and if \( y \) be a function of \( x \), or \( = \phi (x) \), then \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{D\phi (x)}{Dx} = D\phi (x) \) and \( \therefore dy = dx \cdot D\phi (x) \).

Moreover, since the derived functions are in the limiting ratio of the increments, so also are the fluxions. From this consideration we can in the applications of analysis, practically determine the ratio of the fluxions, when the derived functions are unknown.
