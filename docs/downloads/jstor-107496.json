By Captain Edward Sabine, of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, F.R.S. and F.L.S.\n\nRead February 25, 1819.\n\nThe dipping needle used in these observations is the property of Henry Browne, Esq.; it was made by Messrs. Nairne and Blunt, and is similar in construction to one made by the same artists, and described by the Hon. Henry Cavendish in the 66th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, as used in the house of the Royal Society.\n\nPreviously to delivering it into my charge, Mr. Browne had adjusted the balance of the needle by means of the screws on the cross of wires attached to its axis; so that no alteration took place in the indication of the dip, on reversing the poles.\n\nThe instrument was placed in the direction of the magnetic meridian, by a compass stationed at a sufficient distance, and suffered to remain during the observations for the purpose of occasional verification. When time admitted, the correctness of adjustment was also proved, by observing the minimum of dip. An equal number of observations were made with the face of the instrument towards the east and towards the west; the arcs indicated at both ends of the needle were read.\n\nIn determining the intensity of the magnetic force, the needle was drawn to an horizontal position by a magnet, and being released at an observed moment of time, was suffered\nCapt. Sabine's observations on the magnetic needle.\n\nto oscillate until the arcs became too small to be readily distinguished: the first arc was thus equal to the dip, and at every tenth vibration both the arc and time were noted. The observations in the magnetic meridian were repeated with the face of the instrument towards the east and towards the west.\n\nIt is highly satisfactory to notice the agreement of the results which were obtained in London and in Shetland, at different periods, and by different observers; showing that the adjustment of the balance of the needle was preserved during the voyage, notwithstanding the accidents to which it was liable: and as a testimony of the excellence of the instrument, and of the confidence which may be placed in observations made with it.\n\nObservations on the dip.\n\n| Year | Month | Latitude | Longitude | No. of obser. | Observer | Dip | Remarks |\n|------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|-----|---------|\n| 1818 | April | 51° 31' N | 0° 08' W | 16 | Capt.

Sabine's observations on the magnetic needle.\n\nIt is probable that the needle was affected by local attraction either on the 9th or on the 19th of June; but on which day it is difficult to say. On the 9th the ships were anchored to an iceberg of very considerable size, on which the observations were made, the instrument being removed as far as possible from the ships. On the 19th it was used in the observatory which was erected on Hare Island; every fastening of this ingenious and useful building was of brass, and the greatest care was taken to prevent the needle being disturbed by local or accidental causes. But there were several basaltic columns on the face of a hill which rose immediately from the observatory, which may have had an influence; as these columns on Hare Island are said, by Professor Giesecke,* to have a powerful effect on the needle.\n\nObservations on the intensity of the magnetic force.\n\nRegent's Park, London, April, 1818.

Sabine's observations on the magnetic needle.\n\nObservations to determine the variation of the needle, in Davis's Strait, and Baffin's Bay.\n\nThe azimuth compasses used in these observations were constructed on an improved plan, the invention of Captain Kater. It is thus described in the \"Instructions for the use of the Instruments furnished to the Northern Expeditions,\" printed by order of the Royal Society:\n\n\"The compass is five inches diameter; by means of an inclined mirror and lenses, the degrees are seen by reflection considerably magnified; a line drawn on a piece of ivory is viewed at the same time, and serves as an index by which the degrees are to be read off.\n\n\"At the opposite side of the box is a sight on which slides, in a frame, the segment of a glass cylinder, ground to a radius of five inches. By means of this, a fine line of light is thrown on the index, and may be seen at the same time as the degrees on the card.\n\n\"The degrees on the card are read from the north towards the east, and are carried round to $360^\\circ$, in order to obviate the possibility of error in this respect.\"\n\nThe observations were made either on shore or on the ice, sufficiently distant from the ship to be beyond the influence of her attraction. The compass was placed on a copper fastened stool, and was carefully levelled by means of a spirit level, to ensure the perpendicularity of the sight vane.\n\nEach altitude and azimuth is a mean of several observations, the compass being removed and levelled afresh between every one, thus making each faithfully distinct.\nCapt. Sabine's observations on the magnetic needle.\n\nThe mean Greenwich time is given, as it determines the amount of the sun's polar distance.\n\nThe latitudes and longitudes are of the spot, deduced by the ship's log from the nearest observed.\n\nThe altitudes are corrected for index error only, the letters or signs annexed denote the limb, and whether by reflection or by the natural horizon.\n\nThe observed azimuths are of the sun's centre cleared of index error; the compasses used were No. 1 and 2, supplied to the Isabella, and No. 3 to the Alexander; the true azimuths deduced from the elements contained in the preceding columns, are expressed in a corresponding manner to the reading of the compass, for the purpose of comparison.\n\nThe observations were made on ice, except when otherwise noted in the column of remarks.\n\nWhen due consideration is given to the greatly diminished power, with which the earth's magnetism acts on the horizontal direction of the needle, when the dip becomes so considerable as it was found in Davis's Straits and Baffin's Bay, namely, from $83^\\circ$ to $86^\\circ$; the satisfactory results which have been obtained, even under such extreme circumstances with Captain Kater's compasses, afford the best testimony of their excellence, and of the precision which may be expected from them in the ordinary course of observation.\n\nIt may also be remarked, that a difference in the result of azimuths observed at different hours of the day may not be altogether an error of observation, since it is probable that as the directive power of magnetism diminished, the causes which produce the hourly change in the variation itself may act with increased effect.\nCapt. Sabine's observations on the magnetic needle.\n\nShould the amount of this change be considerably augmented in high magnetic latitudes, careful observations on the direction of the needle at different hours of the day, on all convenient occasions, might be serviceable towards a more certain knowledge of its causes, than has been hitherto obtained from observations made where the effects are so inconsiderable.\n\nThe influence of the ship's iron on their compasses increasing, as the directive power of magnetism diminished, produced irregularities that rendered observations on board ship of little or no value towards a knowledge of the true variation; a few azimuths which were observed in the Isabella, have been selected for the purpose of exemplifying this remark. They will also show, how essential it is to navigation in high latitudes, that the nature of the errors which the ship's attraction produces in her compasses, should be understood.\nCapt.
