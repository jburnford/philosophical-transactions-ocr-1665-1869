Since then in the place, where Vision ought to be strongest, the Retina is covered, and that no man doubts but Birds are more clear-sighted than other Animals; you ought to acknowledge, that the Retina is not the principal Organ of Vision, but that that preeminence belongs to the Choroeides.\n\nAN ACCOMPT\nGiven by Doctor Edward Brown, concerning the Copper-mine at Herrn-ground in Hungary.\n\nHerrn-ground is a little town seated very high between two Hills, upon a part of land of the same name, an Hungarian mile distant from Newstol. In this town is the entrance into a large Copper-mine, very much digged.\n\nI went in through a Cuniculus, called Tach-stoln, and continued divers hours in the Mine, and visited many of the most remarkable\nmarkable places in it. The steep descents in this Mine are made by Ladders or Trees set upright, with deep notches or stayers cut in them to stay the foot upon. They are not troubled with water, the Mine lying high in the hill, so that the water may drain away; but they are molested with dust and damps.\n\nThe Veins of this Mine are large, many of them cumulate, and the Ore very rich; in an hundred pounds of Ore they ordinarily finde twenty pounds of Copper; sometimes 30, 40; half Copper, and even to 60 in the hundred. Much of the Ore is joyn'd so fast to the rock, that tis separated with much difficulty. There are divers sorts of Ore, but the chief difference is between the Yellow and the Black: the Yellow is pure Copper-ore; the Black contains also a proportion of Silver.\n\nThey find no Quick-silver here: the mother of the ore is yellow; and the Copper ore, heated and cast into water, maketh it become like that of some Sulphureous Baths.\n\nThey separate the Metal from the Ore with great difficulty. The Ore commonly passes 14 times through the furnaces: sometimes it is burned, and other times melted; sometimes by itself, and sometimes mixt with other minerals and its own dross.\n\nThere are divers sorts of Vitreot found in this Mine, Green, Blew, Reddish, and White. There is also a Green Earth or sediment of a green water, called Berg grun. There are likewise stones found of a beautiful green and blew colour, and one sort, on which Turcoises have been found; therefore called the Mother of the Turcois.\n\nThere are also two Springs of a Vitriolar water, which are affirmed to turn iron into Copper. They are called the Old and the New Ziment. These Springs lye deep in the Mine. The Iron is ordinarily left in the Water 14 dayes. I here present you with some pieces of it, and with an Heart and a Chain, formerly Iron; now appearing to be Copper. Divers of these pieces I took out of the old Ziment. They are hard within the water, and do not totally loose their figure, and fall into powder, as you will perceive by them; they will easily melt, I have sent a piece melted without the addition of any other substance. They make handsome Cups and Vessels out of this Salt of Copper. I drank\ndrank out of one of them, when I was at the Verwalter of Hern-\nground his house: It was gilded over, and had a rich piece of\nSilver-ore, fastned in the middle of it; and this Inscription grav'd\non the outside,\n\nEisen ware Ich, kupfer bin Ich,\nSilber trag Ich, Gold bedeckt mich.\n\ni.e. Copper I am, but Iron was of old,\nSilver I carry, cover'd am with Gold.\n\nAN ACCOMPT\n\nConcerning the Baths of Austria and Hungary; as also some\nStone-Quarries, Talcum rocks, &c. in those parts: By the\nsame hand.\n\nIn order to answer some of the other Queries; I here present\nyou with this Accompt concerning Baths, and some other sub-\njects, contained therein.\n\nBaden is a little City in Austria, four German miles South-\nward from Vienna, seated on a plain, but nigh unto a ridge of\nhills, which are the excursions of Mount Cetius. It is much re-\nsorted unto by reason of the Natural Baths of that place, wherein\nthe Springs are so numerous, as to afford convenient Baths; two\nwithin the Town, five without the Wall, and 2 beyond a rivulet\ncalled Smechet.\n\nThe Dukes-Bath is the largest, about 20 feet square, in the\nmiddle of an house of the same figure, built over it. The Va-\npour passes through a tunnel of wood, at the top: and the Wa-\nter is conveyed into the bottom of the Bath, at one corner,\nthrough wooden pipes and trees, under the Town-wall, from\nthe Spring head, which riseth at a little distance West-ward.\nThe Springs of the rest of the Baths rise under them, and are\nlet in through holes of the Plancher, for all the Baths are wain-\nscoted, the seats, sides and bottoms being made of Firre. The\nWater for the most part is clear and transparent, yet somewhat\nblewish, and maketh the skin appear pale in it, as doth the\nsmoak of Brimstone. It coloreth Metals (except Gold, whose",
