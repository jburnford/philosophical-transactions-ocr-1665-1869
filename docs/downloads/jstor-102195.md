A Letter, subscribed W. Tenon, concerning Dr Papin’s new Water-Engine.

Sir,

The other day, upon reading in the Transactions, a description of the effects of a Water-Engine, invented by Dr Papin, and propounded as a Probleme to find out the contrivance, there came into my mind the following thought. I do not think it is the same with his, nor so good, but such as it is I send you, because variety of fancies gives hints many times to better new inventions.

Tab. i. Fig. 3. \(ABDE\) signifies a cylindrical Vessel, closed
closed on every side, and divided into two rooms by the floor $E F$.

$G L M H$, is another Cylindrical Vessel within that upper room, cemented with its mouth downwards to the floor, and full of water up to the surface $I K$; the upper part thereof $G I K H$, being full of Air.

$Q O, R P$ two Pipes, open above and below, and let through the upper room into this Vessel, and reaching almost down to the floor $E F$.

$U W$ a Pipe open above and below, and let into the upper room. These Pipes must be close joined round about them to the floors $C D$, and $G H$.

$X, Y$, two little hemispherical bladders, prepared with Oyl or some Oily substance (as Butter or Turpentine) against water, and cemented with their Mouths upward to the floor $E F$ underneath.

$\alpha, \beta$ two valves opening out of the upper room into the bladders.

$\gamma, \delta$ two other valves opening out of the bladders into the inner Vessel above.

$N Z$ a pendulum playing upon the center $N$, and having two battledoor arms $a b$ to squeeze alternately the bladders which rest upon them.

Let the upper room be filled with water at the Pipe $U W$, and if the pendulum be made to play by Clockwork, the bladders will perpetually pump it thence into the inner Vessel, and the compress Air $G I K H$ in the upper part of that Vessel, pressing upon the surface of the water $I K$, will force it thence into the Pipes $O Q, P R$, out of which spouting with a perpetual even stream into the spoons $S, T$, it will run down by the Pipe $W U$, into the upper room again. The pendulum will play most easily when the upper room is filled to the top of the Pipe $W U$. Instead of the bladders may be other contrivances, as of suckers or little Organ bellows, playing alternately with two leaves about an axis in the middle.
