PART FIRST.

PREAMBLE.

According to the resolution expressed in the account of the Trigonometrical Survey, printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1795, we now communicate to the public, through the same channel, a farther relation of its progress.

On referring to the above paper, it will be found that, for the prosecution of this undertaking, a design was formed of proceeding to the westward, with a series of triangles, for the survey of the coast. This intention has been carried into effect; and as the small theodolite, or circular instrument, announced in our former communication as then in the hands of Mr. Ramsden, was finished early in the summer of 1795, we are enabled to give a series of triangles, extending, in conjunction with those before given, from the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, to the Land's End.

In the composition of the following account, we have adhered to the plan adopted in the last, of giving the angles of
the great triangles, with their variations; and we have, with as much brevity as possible, inserted a narrative of each year's operations. This will be found, however, to extend only to the First Part, or that containing the particulars of the survey in which the great instrument alone was used. The remaining contents of this portion of the work, are necessarily confined to the angles of the principal, and secondary triangles, with the calculations of their sides, in feet; and likewise such data as have no connection with the computations of latitudes and longitudes.

Part the Second contains an account of a survey carried on in Kent, in the years 1795 and 1796, with the small instrument, by order of the Master General, for completing a map of the eastern and southern parts of that county, for the use of the Board of Ordnance, and the military commanders on the coast.

In Part the First will be found an article, for which we are indebted to Dr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal. It contains his demonstration of M. de Lambre's formula, in the Connoissance des Temps of 1793, for reducing a distance on the sphere to any great circle near it, or the contrary. The practical rule thence derived, for reducing the angles in the plane of the horizon, to those formed by the chords, is very useful, and will considerably abridge the trouble which must necessarily arise in computing the chord corrections by any former method.
SECTION FIRST.

ARTICLE I. Of Particulars relating to the Operations of the Year 1795.

In an early part of this season, from the necessity which existed of completing the map of Kent, mentioned in the preamble, we had conceived that our former intentions, of continuing the survey towards the west, would for the present be relinquished; as it was not imagined that the telescope of the small circular instrument, then in the hands of Mr. Ramsden, could be applied, with good effect, in observing staffs erected on very distant stations.

From the obvious importance, however, of adhering to the first resolution, it was determined that a trial should be made of the excellence of this instrument, in the construction of which extraordinary pains had been taken, by operating with it in Kent, and using it for those purposes to which, if the object before spoken of had not been in view, the great theodolite would have been necessarily applied.

This smaller theodolite, therefore, as a substitute, was in May taken into Kent by Mr. Dalby, and Mr. Gardner, chief draughtsman in the Tower; the assistance of the former being necessary, as the stations in the series of 1787 were for the most part unknown to the latter gentleman.

As the former paper, relating to the trigonometrical survey, could not be presented to the Royal Society before the 4th of June, the business did not commence till the 12th of the same month. The party then left London, and the instrument was taken to Bull Barrow, in Dorsetshire.
On a reference to the account of 1795, it will be seen, that a station was chosen near Lulworth, and observed both from Nine Barrow Down and Black Down. It was also intended to be observed from Bull Barrow; by which means the great triangle, formed by the stations Black Down, Nine Barrow Down, and Bull Barrow, would be divided into, and made to consist of, two smaller triangles. This, however, it was now found could not be done, as a signal house had been erected near the station at Lulworth, subsequent to the operations in 1794, which prevented that spot from being afterwards seen at Bull Barrow: but no consequences very injurious can have arisen from the impracticability of making use of this station in the manner originally proposed, since the stations formerly chosen in Portland, with which that of Lulworth was also intended to connect, have not been visited with the instrument. The stations in that island were selected with a view of observing from them, and Charton Common, some point in the vicinity of Torbay, which might be a proper station in the series intended to be carried along the coast. Such a situation, however, could not be conveniently found, as the view of Devonshire from Charton Common is much interrupted by trees and other obstacles; and it would have been highly improper to shorten the side between Pilsden Hill and the coast, by choosing a station more remote from the latter than Charton Common.

As from an inspection of the plan of the triangles annexed to this account, a doubt may be entertained as to the propriety of carrying on so very extensive a series from the short side connecting the stations on Black Down and Mintern Hill; it must be observed that, admitting the necessity of adopting Bull Barrow for a station, those on Pilsden and Mintern Hills were
naturally chosen; the first, because it connected with Dumpdon (a station that could not be dispensed with); and the second, because it was the point most remote from Black Down, being on the brow of the high land overlooking the general surface of Somersetshire.

To connect with the station formerly chosen near Maiden Bradley, two others were selected whilst the party were at Bull Barrow; one on Ash Beacon, near Sherborne, and the other on the Quantock Hills. Both these have very commanding views, and will hereafter easily unite with any stations which may be chosen to the northward.

From Bull Barrow, the instrument was successively taken to the following stations, before any other new ones were chosen, vi. Mintern, Pilsden, and Charton Common; and whilst the party were at the latter, nearly all the stations were selected in Devonshire. In the choice of these, much difficulty occurred, as the face of this county is particularly unfavourable for operations of this kind. Around Honiton and Chard, there are several small ranges of hills, nearly of an equal height, running in parallel directions. Near the former are three, thus circumstanced; viz. Hembury Fort, Combe Raleigh, and Dumpdon. From the first and second of these, the station on Charton Common is not visible; and it is from the last only, that both Pilsden and the Quantock Hills can be seen. This station, however, has a disadvantage: Combe Raleigh, which is to the west of it, takes off all view round Tiverton and Silferton; so that it became indispensably necessary to select a spot on the northern extremity of Dartmoor, called Cawsand Beacon.

To those who are acquainted with the interior of Dartmoor,
it will be unnecessary to assign the reason for not having chosen any station towards its centre. It may be sufficient to observe, that two spots were found on its circumference, which render the want of it trifling in its consequences.

Independent of the stations to which, as we have before observed, the instrument was taken this year, the following were visited, viz. Dumpdon, Little Haldon, Furland, and Butterton. From the latter, the party returned to London in the month of October.

ART. III. Of Particulars relating to the Operations of the Year 1796.

In the account of this Survey, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795, page 473, it is stated, that large stones were sunk in the ground at the extremities of the base of verification on Salisbury Plain. To render these points permanent, two iron cannon (selected from among the unserviceable ordnance in Woolwich Warren) were, towards the end of February, sent to Salisbury, and in the beginning of March inserted at the ends of the base. The same methods were adopted, for the purpose of fixing these cannon in their proper positions, as those made use of when similar termini were sunk in the ground on Hounslow Heath. This operation having been completed on the 10th of March, the instrument was shortly after carried to Kit Hill, in Cornwall; a station, like that on Bindown, chosen rather for the purpose of a secondary, than a principal place of observation.

It would be tedious, and perhaps unnecessary, to enumerate the names of all the stations selected this year, as many of them do not form any part of the series now given to the public. We shall, therefore, confine ourselves to such remarks on the subject as may serve to abridge this article.

We have before stated, that a station was chosen on Cawsand Beacon, the northern extremity of Dartmoor, for the purpose of connecting with Dumpdon. It should have been observed, that to the westward of the former eminence, and near it, there is a hill considerably higher, which in point of situation has many advantages, but which cannot be made
use of on account of the ruggedness of its surface, which seems to render the carrying of the instrument to its top almost impossible. From this circumstance, and similar impediments, which the high lands remote from the circumference of Dartmoor offer to our operations, it results, that the body of this moor cannot have any great triangles carried over it: such stations were therefore selected this year as may serve, in conjunction with others, to include this tract of country in a polygon of a small number of sides.

To make observations for the purpose of hereafter determining the longitude and latitude of the Lizard, was a principal object in this year's operations; and as this headland seems to offer itself as very convenient for a station, it will be right to assign our reasons for not having chosen one upon it.

As no other spot but Hensbarrow Beacon could be found in that part of Cornwall proper for a station, it became necessary to fix on the Deadman, or Dodman, for another point in the series. From this place no part of the land within four miles of the Lizard can be seen, as the high ground about Black Head, which is to the eastward of the latter, is nearly in a line between them, and is also much higher than both. It will be perceived, however, that no evil can result from the want of such a station, as the light-houses and the naval-signal-staff at the Lizard, have been intersected from several stations. The precise spot on which Mr. Bradley made his observations in the year 1769, for ascertaining the longitude and latitude of this headland, was pointed out by the person having the care of the light-houses, who well remembered the common particulars relating to his operations: such measurements were made from the light-houses to this spot, as may enable us, at a future
period, to compare the results from the data afforded by the trigonometrical operation, with those deduced from the astronomical observations made by the above gentleman. It may be also mentioned, that angles were at the same time taken at the western light-house and signal-staff, for the purpose of finding the situation of the Lizard Point.

We are now to speak of the most important business performed this year; that of making observations to determine the distance of the Scilly Isles from the Land’s End.

To do this as accurately as possible, it became necessary to find stations affording the longest base. The hill near Rosemergy, called the Watch, and the station near St. Buryan, are certainly the most advantageous places, because all the islands can be seen from both; but we could not avail ourselves of the former, as difficulties almost insuperable would have attended an attempt to get the instrument upon it. Another station was therefore selected, on Karnminnis, near St. Ives; a spot as well situated as the place spoken of, provided all the islands could be seen: this, however, does not prove to be the case, St. Martin’s Day-Mark being the only object in the Scilly Islands visible from Karnminnis.

From the stations near the Land’s End (Sennen and Pertinney), as well as that above mentioned (St. Buryan), St. Agnes’ Light-house, and two objects in St. Mary’s, were observed; and as the means by which all their distances are determined, except those of the Day-Mark, from the shortness of the bases (which were, however, the longest that could be found) are exceptionable, it will be right to mention, that while we were engaged in that part of the operation now spoken of, the air was so unusually clear, that we could sometimes, with the
telescope of the great theodolite, discover the soldiers at exercise in St. Mary's island.

Under this article, it will be convenient to state, that we have endeavoured to find some spot to the westward, on which a base might be measured. Had we been fortunate in this respect, it undoubtedly would be eminently advantageous; as those triangles, now extended to the Land's End, would, in that case, be verified in some part of the new series. In Devonshire and Cornwall, however, no place has been discovered by any means fit for the purpose; so that our communicating this work, under the circumstances attending it, is a matter of necessity.

In the present and former seasons, such stations were selected and observed, as were judged to be proper for the future use of the small instrument; and as we had experienced, in the early stage of this Survey, much delay and disappointment from the white lights not being always seen when fired on distant stations, we have since substituted lamps and staffs in their stead. The operations of the present year were continued till October, when the party returned to London.

Pilsden. This station is also in Dorsetshire, and near Broadwindsor. The point is on the S. E. corner of the old parapet.

Chariton Common. The station is in the field adjoining to, and also to the westward of, the Common, and is about two miles from Lyme: it is 50 yards from the eastern hedge, and may be easily found, as Black Down is only visible from that spot, being seen between two trees.

Dumpdon; about three miles N. E. of Honiton. The station is 10 feet northward of the hedge of the plantation, and nearly on the highest part of the hill.

Little Haldon; near Teignmouth, in Devonshire. The station is 80 yards from the Direction Post, and in a line with it and the Obelisk on Great Haldon.

Cawsand Beacon; near South Zeal. The station is about 200 feet north of the Karn, or great heap of stones.

Rippin Tor. This station is also on Dartmoor, and about 5 miles from Ashburton. The point is mid-way between the two heaps of stones.

Furland; a field near the turnpike-gate between Brixen and Dartmouth. The station is near the stone, erected in the middle of the field.

Sennen. This station is in the north-west corner of a field belonging to Mr. Williams. The field may be easily found, as there is no other spot near the town of Sennen, from which the Longship's Light-house, Pertinney, and St. Buryan, can be seen.

Karnminnis, near St. Ives. The station on the top of this hill, may be found from the following measurements:

| Feet | In. |
|------|-----|
| The station from 3 large moor-stones, south of the hedge. | 8 8 from the south |
|      | 11 0 —— north stones. |

St. Buryan. The station is in a field adjoining the town, and by the side of the Penzance road. It is $84\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the stile, and 48 feet from a large stone in the northern hedge. This stone is 81 feet from the stile; the station, this stone, and Chapel Karnbury, being in a right line.

ART. VI. Demonstration of M. de Lambre's Formula in the Connoissance des Temps of 1793, for reducing a Distance on the Sphere to any great Circle near it, or the contrary. By Nevil Maskelyne, D. D. F. R. S. and Astronomer Royal.

Put $A =$ angle subtended by two terrestrial objects; $a =$ the same reduced to the horizon; $H, b$ the two apparent altitudes: if either is a depression, it must be taken negative.

By spherics, $c, A = c, a \cdot c, H \cdot c, b + s, H \cdot s, b.$

Put $A = a + d a$, where $d a$ signifies $A - a$, and not their differential.

By trigonometry $c, A = c, a \cdot c, d a - s, a \cdot s, d a = c, a \times \sqrt{1 - vs}, d a - s, a \cdot s, d a = c, a - c, a \times 2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a - s, a \cdot s, d a$ (by theo-
rem above) = c, a . c, H . c, b + s, H . s, b . . s, d a + 2 s^2,
\(\frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a = 't, a - 't, a . c, H . c, b - s, H . s, b \times \text{cosec. } a\)
= \(t', a - 't, a \times \frac{1}{2} c, H - b + \frac{1}{2} c, H + b - \text{cosec. } a\)
\(\times \frac{1}{2} c, H - b - \frac{1}{2} c, H + b\) (because \(t', a = \frac{1}{2} 't, \frac{1}{2} a - \frac{1}{2} t, \frac{1}{2} a;\)
and \(\text{cosec. } a = \frac{1}{2} 't \frac{1}{2} a + \frac{1}{2} t, \frac{1}{2} a) = \frac{1}{2} 't, \frac{1}{2} a - \frac{1}{2} t, \frac{1}{2} a\)
\(\times 1 - \frac{1}{2} c, H - b - \frac{1}{2} c, H + b - \frac{1}{2} 't, \frac{1}{2} a + \frac{1}{2} t, \frac{1}{2} a\)
\(\times \frac{1}{2} c, H - b - \frac{1}{2} c, H + b = \frac{1}{2} 't, \frac{1}{2} a \times 1 - c, H - b\)
\(- \frac{1}{2} t, \frac{1}{2} a \times 1 - c, H + b = \frac{1}{2} 't, \frac{1}{2} a \times vs, H - b - \frac{1}{2} t, \frac{1}{2} a\)
\(\times vs, H + b = 't, \frac{1}{2} a . s^2, \frac{1}{2} H - b - t, \frac{1}{2} a . s^2, \frac{1}{2} H + b.\)

Put \(n = 't, \frac{1}{2} a . s^2, \frac{1}{2} (H - b) - t, \frac{1}{2} a . s^2, \frac{1}{2} (H + b),\)

We shall have

\(s, d a + 2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a = n;\)
and \(s, d a = n - 2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a.\)

But \(s, d a = 2 s, \frac{1}{2} d a . c, \frac{1}{2} d a\)

\(\therefore s, \frac{1}{2} d a = \frac{s, d a}{2 c, \frac{1}{2} d a} = \frac{n - 2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a}{2 c, \frac{1}{2} d a},\)

and \(s, d a = n - 2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a = n - 2 't, a \left(\frac{n - 2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a}{2 c, \frac{1}{2} d a}\right)^2,\)

because \(\left(\frac{n - 2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a}{2 c, \frac{1}{2} d a}\right)^2 = \frac{n - 4 n . s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a + 4 s^4, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't^2, a}{4 \times 1 - s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a}\)

\[\frac{n^2}{4} + \frac{n^2 s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a}{4} - n . s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a - n . s^4, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't, a\]

\(+ s^4, \frac{1}{2} d a . 't^2, a) = n - \frac{1}{2} n^2 . 't, a - \frac{1}{2} n^2 . 't, a . s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a\)

\(+ 2 n . 't^2, a . s^2, \frac{1}{2} d a + 2 n . 't^2, a . s^4, \frac{1}{2} d a - 2 . 't^3, a . s^4 + \frac{1}{2} d a,\)

by substituting for \(s, \frac{1}{2} d a\) its near value \(n,\)

\[n - \frac{1}{2} n^2 . 't, a - \frac{n^4 . 't, a}{8} + \frac{1}{2} n^3 . t^2, a + \frac{1}{8} n^5 . 't^2, a - \frac{1}{8} n^4 . 't^3, a,\]

where the last term but one containing the 5th power of \(n\) may be rejected, as it has been omitted by M. de Lambre.

As \(d a\) is always very small, the arc \(d a\) in parts of the radius, unity, \(= s, d a\) in parts of the same radius, therefore

\]

\[- t, \frac{1}{2} a.s^2, \frac{1}{2} (H + b), \text{and } d a = a \text{ number of seconds, we shall have}\]

\(d a = n - da.s, \frac{1}{2} da.'t, a; \text{and, for the most part, without any sensible error, } d a = n - n.s, \frac{1}{2} n.'t, a.\)

Table I. contains \(\frac{1'' \times t, \frac{1}{2} a}{10000}\), and \(\frac{1'' \times 't, \frac{1}{2} a}{10000}\); Table II. contains

\(10000 \times s^2, \frac{1}{2} (H \mp b)\). Table III. contains the term \(-n.s, \frac{1}{2} n.'t, a.\) The argument on the side is \(a\), and that on the top is \(n\) or the result found by the help of the two first tables. If this correction should be considerable, with the value of \(d a\), found after this correction has been applied, enter Table III. again at the top, and with \(a\) on the side as before; the number now found subtracted from \(n\) will give the correct value of \(d a\).

By the investigation,

\(d a = \frac{1}{2}'t, \frac{1}{2} a.vs \bar{H} \simeq b - \frac{1}{2} t, \frac{1}{2} a.vs, \bar{H} \pm b - vs, d a.'t a,\)

where the upper or lower signs are to be used, according as the objects are on the same, or on contrary sides of the great circle to which they are referred; the third term will be negative or positive, according as \(a\) is less or more than \(90^\circ\).* If \(d a\) should come out negative, \(A\) will be less than \(a\), or \(a\) greater than \(A\). In the case of reducing a spheric angle to the angle

* Compute the two, which will give the approximate value of \(d a\), and make use of them in computing the third term; and join the three terms together according to their signs, which will give \(d a\) still nearer; and, if this should prove considerable, compute the third term a second time with the new value of \(d a\).
between the chords, the spheric angle will be represented by \(a\), and the angle between the chords by \(A = a + da\); and \(da = \frac{1}{2}t, \frac{1}{2}a \cdot vs, H \sim b - \frac{1}{2}t, \frac{1}{2}a \cdot vs, H + b - vs, da \cdot t, a\) (if \(D, d\) represent the arcs to the chords) \(= \frac{1}{2}t, \frac{1}{2}a \cdot vs, \frac{1}{2}(D \sim d)\) \(- \frac{1}{2}t, \frac{1}{2}a \cdot vs, \frac{1}{2}(D + d) - vs, da \cdot t, a\);

\(A = a - (\frac{1}{2}t, \frac{1}{2}a \cdot vs, \frac{1}{2}D + d - \frac{1}{2}t, \frac{1}{2}a \cdot vs \frac{1}{2}D \sim d) - vs, da \cdot t, a\); where the last term will change its sign to affirmative, if \(a\) is greater than \(90^\circ\). If the answer is required in seconds, the correction must be multiplied by \(206265\), the number of seconds in an arc \(=\) radius. The calculation will be easily made by logarithms.

**Practical Rule.**

The practical rule deduced from the above conclusions is the following, and given in the words of the Astronomer Royal.

"To the constant logarithm \(5,0134\) add \(L \cdot t, \frac{1}{2}a\) and \(L \cdot vs D + d\); the sum diminished by \(20\) in the index is the logarithm of the first part of the value of \(da\) in seconds, which is always negative. To the constant logarithm \(5,0134\) add \(L \cdot t', \frac{1}{2}a\), and \(L \cdot vs, \frac{1}{2}D \sim d\), the sum diminished by \(20\) in the index, is the logarithm of the second part in seconds, which is always affirmative. These two joined together, according to their proper signs, will give the approximate value of \(da\). To its logarithmic versed sine, add \(L \cdot t', a\) and constant logarithm \(5,3144\), the sum, diminished by \(20\) in the index, will be the logarithm of the third part in seconds, which will be negative or affirmative, according as \(a\) is less or more than \(90^\circ\). This applied according to its sign, to the..."
The Account of a

"approximate value of \(d_a\), will give the correct value of \(d_a\).
"If the third part comes out considerable, it should be com-
"puted anew with the last value of \(d_a\). The value of \(d_a\),
"finally corrected, applied to \(a\), will give A, the angle between
"the chords."

In the application of the above rule, to the computation of
such corrections as may be applied to the angles of any tri-
angles in this survey, it is manifest that the last step may be
entirely neglected on account of the smallness of the approxi-
mate value of \(d_a\), whose versed sine is one of the arguments.
Being, therefore, confined to the use of the two first steps, the
operation is very short. An example is here given in the com-
putation of the correction for reducing the angle at Chancton-
bury Ring in the 39th triangle, given in the last account (see

By the latter triangle we get the distance from Lansallos to Carraton Hill 68929.7 feet; which being obtained from the least number of triangles, we shall make use of in the calculations of the sides farther to the westward. The same conclusion, however, is nearly obtained by making the computations pass through the triangles connected with Kit Hill and the station on Bindown.
Distance from Butterton to Maker Heights 75760.8 feet.

The angles in the above series of triangles, are those arising from taking the means of the several observations: and the same rules have been adopted for their corrections, which were laid down in the account of the trigonometrical operation, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. The angle at Blackdown in the XLVII. triangle (for the triangles of the present series are numbered in order from those of the former), is considered to be nearly 2" in defect, and has been augmented for calculation accordingly: the angle at that station was observed under circumstances less favourable, than those which attended the observations made on Pilsden, and Charton Common.

N. B. 6" must be subtracted from the elevations, and added to the depressions, on account of the error in the parallelism of the line of collimation of the telescope, and the rod attached to its side, upon which the level is hung.

The axis of the telescope was about $5\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the ground at all the above stations.

Reduce the elevations, or depressions, to the place of the axis of the telescope at each station, by adding, or subtracting, as the case may require, the angle at the place of observation, subtended by the vertical height between the object, whose elevation or depression was observed, and the axis of the telescope when at that station.*

2. Then, if both are depressions, subtract their sum from the contained arc, and half the remainder is the mean refraction.

3. If one is a depression and the other an elevation, take their difference. Then, if the depression is greater than the elevation, subtract the difference from the contained arc, and half the remainder is the mean refraction. But if the elevation is greatest, add the difference to the contained arc, and half the sum is the mean refraction.

* For example. At the station on Hensbarrow, the ground at Bodmin Down was depressed $31' 27''$: the distance of those stations is 47337 feet; and the axis of the telescope was $5\frac{1}{2}$ feet above the ground: therefore, as $47337 : \text{radius} :: 5\frac{1}{2} \text{ feet} : \text{tang. } 24''$ the angle subtended by $5\frac{1}{2}$ feet at that distance; which, taken from $31' 27''$, gives $31' 3''$ for the depression of the place of the axis, instead of the ground. Again, at Bodmin Down, the ground at Hensbarrow was elevated $23' 57''$, to which adding $24''$, we have $24' 21''$ for the elevation of the place of the axis.

**ART. IV. Remarks, &c. on the foregoing Table.**

The height of the ground at the station on Maker Heights, 402 feet, was determined by levelling down to low-water mark, near the passage house, below Mount Edgcumbe, on April 15, 1796. This, however, had been done several years before, by some officers of the Royal Engineers, who found it to be 401 feet. The height of the station near Dunnose, in the Isle of Wight, was also found by levelling; of which an account is given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. It therefore
may be considered as the least exceptionable mode of procedure, to deduce the intermediate heights from both those stations; for which purpose, the following comparison was made, exhibiting the height of the station on Charton Common, both ways.

Height of Nine Barrow Down (Phil. Trans. 1795, p. 582) 642
of Black Down - - - - 825
of Charton Common, deduced from the height of Dunnose - - - - 597

Height of Butterton - - - - 1201
of Rippin Tor - - - - 1545
of Furland - - - - 585
of Haldon - - - - 811
of Charton Common, deduced from the height of Maker - - - - 568
from that of Dunnose 597

difference 29

Those are the heights resulting directly from the observations. Now, supposing the difference, or the errors, to arise from the mean refractions, and those errors to be nearly the same between every two stations, we shall obtain the corrected heights in the following manner:

Nine Barrow Down 642 - 4 = 638
Black Down 825 - 8 = 817
Charton Common 597 - 15 = 582
Butterton - 1201 + 2 = 1203
Rippin Tor 1545 + 4 = 1549
Haldon - 811 + 7 = 818
Charton Common 568 + 14 = 582

as in the table.
From those corrected heights, the others to the northward have been deduced. The heights to the westward of Butterton were determined from that of Maker. A mean of two or three results, by using $\frac{1}{15}$ of the contained arcs for refraction, is taken for the height of the station on Mintern Hill.

We subjoin the following elevations and depressions, for the use of those who may wish to examine the tables of heights and refractions, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795. And here it is to be noted, that the axis of the telescope was always about $5\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the ground, unless the contrary is specified.

The above triangles, and those which follow in this section, are numbered in order from the secondary series, given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795.

ART. II. Triangles for ascertaining the Distances of the Eddystone Light-house, from the Flagstaff of Plymouth Garrison, and the Rame-bead.

The ball on the lantern of the Light-house was observed from the stations on Butterton, Kit Hill, and Carraton Hill; and as much uncertainty has heretofore existed, with respect to a knowledge of its true distance from any point in the neighbourhood of Plymouth, observations were made on various arcs of the circle of the instrument, at the two first stations.

The triangles are the following:

With the distance of the Eddystone Light-house from Kit Hill, and also that of the Flagstaff in Plymouth garrison from the same station, we find the distance from the Light-house to the Flagstaff = 73061 feet;* the observed angle being 29° 42' 34"': and, computing with the data obtained from the last triangle, and the 223d,

* On referring to the late Mr. Smeaton's Narrative of the Building of the Eddystone Light-house, it will be found, that, from a trigonometrical process, founded on two bases measured on the Hoe, among other deductions, he concluded the distance between the above objects was 73464 feet; being 403 greater than the distance found by the above computation.
with the observed angle at Carraton Hill = 16° 22' 1'', we get 49435 feet for the distance of the Eddystone Light-house from the building on Rame-head. It may be proper to observe, that the Eddystone Light-house is nearer to the Rame-head than to any other point on the coast.

From the two last triangles we obtain 79640 feet for the mean distance between the Lizard Signal-staff and the station on Karnbonellis. Computing with this distance, and also that from the Western Light-house to the same station, with the observed angle 0° 31' 8'', we get 1857 feet for the distance between those objects.
For the purpose of ascertaining the situation of the Lizard Point, two angles in the following triangle were observed with a sextant, viz.

| Naval-Signal-staff | - | 77° 4' |
|-------------------|---|--------|
| Western Light-house | - | 60° 50' |

**Lizard Point**

These, with the computed distance from the Signal-staff to the Light-house, give the distance of the Lizard Point from the Signal-staff \(2419\) feet. Hence, the distance of the point from the station on Karnbonellis is \(81085\) feet, the angle at that station, between the Lizard Point and Western Light-house, being \(1° 53' 47''\). With respect to the means by which the situation of the spot, on which Mr. Bradley erected his observatory in 1769, may hereafter be determined, it will be readily understood from the following diagram; where E is the Eastern Light-house, W the Western Light-house, F the Signal-staff, P the Lizard Point, and O the place of the Observatory. The distance between the spot O, and M,* the place where his meridian mark was fixed, we measured and found = 800 feet; M being 24 feet north of the line joining the centres of the Light-houses.

* The person spoken of in Sect. 1. Art. 3. as having the care of the Light-houses, pointed out this spot.

The distance from the Day-Mark to Karnminnis, as obtained from the 309th triangle, is 190985 feet, and by the 310th, 190989 feet, which differs only 4 feet from the former; and by the 310th and 311th triangles, the difference of the distances from the same object, to the station on Pertinney, is 17 feet; which, allowing for the shortness of the bases, must be considered as trifling. We may presume, therefore, that had not the Day-Mark been seen from Karnminnis, but from Sennen and Pertinney alone, the observations from which the angles of the 311th triangle are derived, would have afforded the means of computing the distance with sufficient precision. In like manner the 312th and 313th triangles seem to prove, that the observations made to St. Agnes’ Light-house were sufficiently accurate, as there is a difference only of 16 feet between the distances of the Light-house from Pertinney. The ball on the top of the Light-house was the object always observed; and the Day-Mark being pyramidal, we had the means of making the observations at the different stations to the same point of this building.
ART. V. Of the Distances of the Objects in the Scilly Isles, (intersected from the Stations in the West of Cornwall) from Sennen Steeple; the Stone near the Land’s End; and the Longship’s Light-house.

As the observations made to the Day Mark, and St. Agnes’ Light-house, may be supposed sufficiently accurate; and the ball on the top of the Longship’s Light-house was also observed under favourable circumstances, it will be proper to apply the corrections to the horizontal angles, in order to obtain those formed by the chords. Taking, therefore, Pertinney as the angular point, and computing with the following data, viz.

Station on Pertinney from - 
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Day-Mark} & = 154551 \text{ Feet.} \\
\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 182207 \\
\text{Longship’s Light-house} & = 27883
\end{align*}
\]

the angle at Pertinney, augmented for calculation, between the Longship’s Light-house and the Longship’s Light-house from -
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{the Day-Mark} & = 12° 17' 30'' \\
\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 6° 15' 25''
\end{align*}
\]
We get the distance of

Calculating also, with the distances of the two other objects in the Scilly Isles, and likewise those of Sennen Steeple, and the Stone near the Land’s End from Pertinney, with the included angles at the same station, we get

Sennen Steeple from -
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Day Mark} & = 139521 = 26,43 \text{ Miles.} \\
\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 166255 = 31,49 \\
\text{Flagstaff in St. Mary’s} & = 157912 = 29,95 \\
\text{Windmill in St. Mary’s} & = 155299 = 29,41
\end{align*}
\]

Stone near the Land’s End from -
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Day Mark} & = 135343 = 25,63 \\
\text{St. Agnes’ Light-house} & = 162100 = 30,7 \\
\text{Flagstaff in St. Mary’s} & = 153744 = 29,11 \\
\text{Windmill in St. Mary’s} & = 151138 = 28,63
\end{align*}
\]
Of the Scilly Isles, Menawthen is the nearest to the Land's End, being about $1\frac{2}{15}$ miles eastward of the Day-Mark; and the cluster of rocks, called the Bishop and his Clerks, the most remote, being $3\frac{1}{3}$ miles west of St. Agnes' Light-house. Combining, therefore, the above particulars with those distances, we may conclude, that the nearest part of the Scilly Isles is about $24.7$ miles from the Land's End, and the farthest nearly $34$.

PART SECOND.

SECTION I.

Account of a Trigonometrical Survey carried on in Kent, in the Years 1795, and 1796, with the small circular Instrument.

ARTICLE I. Particulars respecting the Instrument.

The instrument used in this survey was announced in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795, p. 590. It was made by Mr. Ramsden; and is about half the size of his large theodolite, or circular instrument, with which we take the horizontal angles, but nearly similar to it in all its parts; consequently a very brief description will be sufficient.

The most material variations in the construction are,

1. The levelling or feet screws. These are below that horizontal movement which serves to direct the lower telescope to any particular object. By this position of the screws, the horizontal circle being once made level, the whole instrument may be moved round without disturbing its horizontality; the levelling screws remaining stationary during that operation,
which cannot be done in the large instrument, because the screws are carried round with it.

2. The diameter of the horizontal circle being only half that of the larger one, it follows, that the space between any two dots on the limb, gives double the number of minutes that are contained in the same space on the greater circle: on this account, each revolution in the micrometer screw in the microscope answers to $2'$; and the circle on the microscopic micrometer being divided into 60 parts, each division becomes equal to $2''$, but for the conveniency of notation, they are numbered at every 5th, with 10, 20, &c. to 50, the 60th being marked 1, to denote $1'$: the number of seconds then commencing as before, the whole revolution becomes $2'$. The revolutions are counted by means of notches on one side of the field in the microscope, in the same manner as in those of the large instrument.

3. This instrument not being intended for determining the direction of the meridian, a vertical semicircle for directing the telescope to the pole star became unnecessary; yet some apparatus was required, whereby small elevations or depressions from the horizon might be ascertained with a tolerable degree of precision. For this purpose, a moveable index, of about four inches long, is made to turn on the horizontal axis of the upper telescope, and so constructed, that by means of a finger screw, it can be fixed firmly in any position. The lower end of this index is furnished with a steel micrometer screw, having a circle on its head, divided into 100 parts, for shewing the fractional parts of a revolution, while other divisions, on a chamfered edge of the index which marks the fractional parts, give the number of revolutions made by the micrometer screw.
The method of finding the value of a revolution of the micrometer head in parts of a degree, &c. was as follows:

A rod, 14 or 16 feet long, was placed horizontally about three quarters of a mile off, and the angle subtended by its ends measured with the instrument in the usual way: the rod was then set up perpendicular at the same place, and the cross wires in the telescope directed to one of its extremities: the telescope was then moved in the vertical plane, by means of the micrometer screw, till the cross wires coincided with the other extremity. In this manner, by counting the number of revolutions, &c. necessary to move the telescope from one position to the other, an angle was measured vertically with the micrometer screw, equal to the former horizontal angle. From repeated trials, the value of a revolution was found equal to $10' 27''$.

This instrument, on account of its portable size, may very readily be taken to the tops of steeples, towers, &c. and is, therefore, extremely well adapted to the uses for which it was intended.

ART. II. Situations of the Stations on which Observations were made with the small circular Instrument, in the Summer of the Year 1795.

Folkstone Turnpike, the station made use of by General Roy in 1787.

Hawkinge, about three quarters of a mile from Folkstone Turnpike. This station was chosen for the purpose of having a view of the Belvidere in Waldershare Park, which cannot be seen from the station of 1787.
The Account of a

Dover Castle.

Paddlesworth; about 400 feet from the station of 1787. This new spot was selected, because Hardres Steeple is not visible from the old station.

Waldershare; on the Belvidere in the Earl of Guilford's Park.

On Ringswold Steeple.

On a sand hill near the sea shore, between Deal and Ramsgate: this station is denominated Shore.

Near Mount Pleasant House, Isle of Thanet.

On a rising ground near Wingham.

On Chislet Steeple.

In Beverley Park, near Canterbury.

On Upper Hardres Steeple.

ART. III. Triangles for determining the Distances of the Stations.

As the station on the Keep of Dover Castle, in 1787, was directly over the steps of the Turret, a new point was chosen about $6\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the former, where the instrument could stand conveniently: this new point is about 2,8 feet farther from Folkestone Turnpike, and 1 foot farther from Paddlesworth, than the point marking the old station.

From General Roy's Account of the Trigonometrical Survey in 1787, we have

Dover Castle from Folkestone Turnpike $31554_{6}$ feet.
from Paddlesworth $42561_{2}$ feet.

Now, augmenting those distances in the proportion of 141747 to 141753 (see Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX, p. 595, and the Vol.
for 1795, p. 508), we get 31556, and 42563 feet; to which adding 2,8, and 1, respectively, we have

The new point on Dover Castle from Folkstone

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Turnpike} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 31558.8 \\
\text{from Paddlesworth} & \quad 42564
\end{align*}
\]

feet.

In order to obtain the distance between Waldershare and Dover Castle from those new sides, or distances, the three angles of the following triangle were very carefully taken.

\[
\begin{align*}
1 \quad \text{Dover Castle} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 3 \quad 49 \quad 16 \quad 3 \quad 49 \quad 15 \\
\text{Folkstone Turnpike} & \quad 36 \quad 6 \quad 31 \quad 36 \quad 6 \quad 30 \\
\text{Hawkinge} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 140 \quad 4 \quad 16 \quad 140 \quad 4 \quad 15
\end{align*}
\]

for computation.

The third angles of the two next triangles were not observed:

\[
\begin{align*}
2 \quad \text{Hawkinge} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 44 \quad 23 \quad 30 \\
\text{Dover Castle} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 73 \quad 53 \quad 44 \\
\text{Waldershare} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 61 \quad 42 \quad 46
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
3 \quad \text{Dover Castle} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 62 \quad 24 \quad 7 \\
\text{Paddlesworth (the station of 1787)} & \quad 32 \quad 36 \quad 9 \\
\text{Waldershare} & \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad - \quad 84 \quad 59 \quad 44.
\end{align*}
\]

By the two first triangles, Dover Castle from Waldershare

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Feet.} & \quad 23019.4 \quad 23020.5 \quad \text{mean distance.}
\end{align*}
\]

From the latter

\[
\begin{align*}
& \quad 23021.5
\end{align*}
\]

And Hawkinge from

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Dover Castle} & \quad 28976 \\
\text{Waldershare} & \quad 31616
\end{align*}
\]

N. B. The angles at the stations, or objects, denoted in italics, are supplemental, or were not observed. And it is also to be remarked, that whenever Paddlesworth is mentioned hereafter, the new station is to be understood.

ART. V. Triangles carried over another Part of Kent in 1795; with Remarks.

On account of the high woody lands to the westward of Hardres and Paddlesworth, the triangles could not be extended in that direction, and therefore the following may be considered as a detached part of the Survey this year.

The Stations were,

Westwell Down,
Wye Down,
Brabourn Down,
Allington, or Aldington Knoll, the station of 1787.

Allington Knoll from Tenterden, according to General Roy's account, is 61775.3 feet, which increased in the proportion of 141747 to 141753 becomes 61778 feet. The centre of the top of Tenterden Steeple is about 4 or 4½ feet farther from Allington Knoll than the point marking the station in 1787; therefore the distance of the centre from Allington Knoll will be 61782 feet, which is used in the following computations; because, as a flagstaff of moderate height.
cannot be easily distinguished among the pinnacles at any considerable distance, it was thought it might be sufficiently accurate for the present purpose, to intersect the steeple itself.

The bearings, and distances of the stations and intersected objects, together with their latitudes and longitudes, are given in the following Section.
SECTION II.

Operations in 1796, with the small circular Instrument.

ART. I. Situations of the Stations.

Lydd
Allington Knoll
High Nook
Fairlight Down
Goudhurst
Tenterden

Stations in the Survey of 1787.

Westwell Down Station, used in 1795. See Art. v. Section I.

Part Second.

Silver Hill, near Robertsbridge. The station is 22 yards S.W. of the Windmill.

Boughton Malherb Steeple.

ART. II. Triangles for finding the Distances of the Stations.

From the 5th Article in the last Section, we get the distance from Westwell Down to the new station on Tenterden Steeple = 58629.4 feet. This used in the following triangle,

| Boughton Malherb | 81 55 9 |
|------------------|---------|
| Westwell Down    | 63 44 8 |
| Tenterden        | 34 20 43 |

gives the distance from Boughton Malherb to Westwell Down 33409 feet. Also in the following triangle, using 54376.9 feet for the distance from Tenterden to Goudhurst,

| Goudhurst       | 52 5 44 |
|-----------------|---------|
| Boughton Malherb| 53 54 20 |
| Tenterden       | 75 59 56 |

MDCCXCVII.
we get $33404.5$ feet for the distance between the same stations; hence the mean, $33406.8$ feet, may be taken for the true distance between Boughton Malherb and Westwell Down. From this latter triangle also, we obtain the distance from Boughton Malherb to Tenterden $53097.6$ feet.

|     | Silver Hill| $70^°\ 32'\ 26''$ | Silver Hill from Goudhurst | $40043.1$ |
|     | Tenterden | $43^°\ 58'\ 27''$ |          |

Fairlight Down from Tenterden $71637.7$ feet.

|     |           |                 | Feet.    |

|     | Silver Hill | $82^°\ 25'\ 8''$ | Silver Hill from Fairlight D. | $56174.2$ |
|     | Tenterden | $51^°\ 0'\ 47''$ |          |

By the two last triangles, we get $52472.4$ and $52481.4$ feet for the distances of Tenterden from Silver Hill; the mean of which, $52476.9$, we shall hereafter use in determining the distances of the objects, intersected from those stations.

The distance of Goudhurst from Tenterden, and that of Tenterden from Fairlight Down, are derived from those given by General Roy, in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LXXX. augmented in the proportion of $141747$ to $141753$. The distances also, hereafter made use of, between Lydd, and the stations on Fairlight Down, Tenterden Steeple, Allington Knoll, and High Nook, together with that of High Nook from Allington Knoll, are obtained by increasing the distances, found in the same work, in the above proportion. It is proper to
remark, that it has not been thought necessary to reduce the distance between the station on Westwell Down, and the new station on Tenterden Steeple, to that between the former, and the old point at Tenterden, from the trifling difference of those distances.

During the operation of this year, the instrument was also taken to the following stations, viz.

Bidenden Steeple,
Hartridge,
Warehorn Steeple,
Stone Crouch,
Iden Steeple.

To determine the distances between these objects, and the stations from whence they were observed, we have the following triangles.

SECTION III.

Containing the Distances of the Objects intersected in the Survey with the small circular Instrument, from the Meridian of Greenwich, and from the Perpendicular to that Meridian. Also their Latitudes and Longitudes.

ART. I. Bearings and Distances, 1795.

At Folkstone turnpike, the bearing of the station on Dover Castle in 1787, from the parallel to the meridian of Greenwich is $65^\circ 52' 46''$ N E (See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX, page 603). The new point on the Keep is $6\frac{1}{2}$ feet north-eastward from the old one, which will subtend an angle at Folkstone turnpike of about $38''$; therefore the new station bears $65^\circ 52' 8''$ N E. The bearing of the centre of Tenterden Steeple from Allington Knoll, is nearly the same as that of the station in 1787, or $85^\circ 47' 25''$ S W.: but the distances of those stations (Folkstone turnpike and Allington Knoll, see page 232 of the same Volume), from the meridian of Greenwich, and its perpendicular, are augmented in the proportion of $141747$ to $141753$, for obtaining the distances in the 3d and 4th columns of the following table: Folkstone turnpike being $274979$ and $137220$; and Allington Knoll $219935$ and $144038$ feet, respectively, from the meridian, and its perpendicular.

CONCLUSION.

The account contained in the foregoing pages is presented in its present form, agreeable to the resolution expressed in our last communication. It is there stated, or rather implied, that, as materials are collected, details will meet the public eye through the medium of the Philosophical Transactions. The publishing of these particulars at periods not very remote from each other, will prove convenient, as we shall be enabled to communicate many data, which would be necessarily withheld, were these disclosures less frequent. It is on this account, that the particulars in Part the First do not contain the latitudes and longitudes of the stations, and objects intersected, as sufficient data have not yet been obtained for making the computations in an unexceptionable manner: but the contents of the Second Part are more complete, that Survey having been carried on in a country sufficiently near the meridian of Greenwich to give the necessary arguments with precision.

It is perhaps scarcely necessary to observe, that the design intended to be answered by an admission of the plans of the triangles annexed to this account, is to enable the reader to comprehend with ease the state of the operation, and to apply, without difficulty, the materials found in the body of the work to future Surveys. We have therefore, not attempted to delineate any varieties of ground in the plan of the western triangles (Tab. XI.): and it may, in this place, be proper to mention,
that the ranges of hills expressed in the plan found in our last account, were copied from authorities of the late Major General Roy. The map now given, of the operations performed in Kent (Tab. XII.), has the ground depicted in as accurate a manner as the scale will admit of, Mr. Gardner, from the minuteness of this Survey, being enabled to do it with accuracy.

On adverting to a principal object of this undertaking, that of preparing materials for correcting the geography of the country, it may be expected something should be said, respecting the accuracy of the maps of those counties in which our operations have been carried on. It is almost unnecessary to observe, that great correctness cannot result from the methods commonly taken in large surveys, which are usually made with an apparatus altogether unfit for measuring angles or bases with a sufficient degree of accuracy: and it will evidently appear, on applying the distances given in this, and our former paper, to those maps, that they are, generally, very defective. We must, however, observe, that Linley's and Crossley's Map of Surry, and Gardner's Map of Sussex, are the best which have yet fallen under our notice: the first is, in some measure, indebted for its excellence to the Trigonometrical Operation in 1787; and the latter to our own; as the distances between many stations, and the situations of many churches, in the southern, and western parts of Sussex, were given to Mr. Gardner prior to the publication of our last account. The geography of Devonshire and Dorsetshire is found particularly erroneous, as may be easily discovered by an application of our distances to the best maps of those counties.
N. B. In Tab. XI. the triangles connecting the three principal objects in the Scilly Isles, and the stations from whence they were intersected, are laid down in that detached position to shorten the plan.

Page 469, line 4, for 124 read 125.
507, line 18, for 258 read 285.
527, in the table, for $51^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ read $50^\circ$ and $66^\circ$.
ib. ib. col. 4, for 30 read 33.
554, against Southwick Church, for 57710 read 5771.

580, line 10 from bottom, for 39" read 47".
584, lines 2 and 3, for $\frac{1}{15}$ read $\frac{1}{13}$.

The triangles numbered 84, 100, 105, are doubtful, and consequently the results depending on them are uncertain.
