VI. An Account of Books, viz.

1. Dissertatio anatomico-medica de motu bilis circularis ejusq, morbis quam publice olim habuit Mauritius van Reverhorst Medic. Cand. Lugd. Bat. nunc professor anatomicus Hage-Comitis in 80. pag. 64.

This is a 2d Edition of a Disputation concerning the circulation of the Bile or Choler, in which is an Anatomical Description of the Liver and all its parts, illustrated with a Figure of its internal and external Lymphatics. The Author thinks the grossest part of the Bile goes along the Guts with the excrements, and that the more volatile enters the Mesaraic Veins, and with the venous Blood goes to the vena porta, from thence to the Liver, in whose Glandules 'tis separated, and from thence Fait is carried again into the Guts by the Ductus Cholidochus, from whence part returns into
into the Blood again, circulating as before. He thinks this reasonable, because the mesaraic veins are larger than other veins, and the Blood in the vena porta differs in taste from other Blood; and there is a greater quantity of Bile comes into the Guts than would make up the whole Excrements. He endeavours to prove this by the following experiment. He took a large Dog, open'd the Belly and intestinum duodenum, he put into the ductus choliodochus a pipe, such as is used in the transfusion of the Blood, to the end of which was adapted a small plual. In two hours half an ounce of gall was in the glass, the third hour was two drams, the 4th, 5th, and 6th hours the like quantity, only less, which he supposes proceeded from the slower circulation of the Blood, if 2 drams is separated in an hour, then in 24, is six ounces: He believes in men the quantity separated larger, and at least 3 drams, so that 9 ounces would be separated everywhere, when some men have not so much excrement. He says, that blowing with a Pipe into the mesaraic Veins, will distend the intestines. The same he argues from Fowls of all sorts, wanting Lacteals, so that the Chyle must pass by the mesaraics. In considering the Diseases of the Bile, he mentions one, which he found on dissection of a Body, wherein there was a great hardness of the Concave part of the Liver, and it was found to proceed from a great hardness and wideness of the pori bilarii, from their being fill'd with a calculous matter. The Figure of this is graved. A 2d he tells of a woman of 30 years, who had an intermitting Fever, fell into a constipated Belly, and after some time languished and died. In her Gall-bladder there was found 8 large cornered Stones, which are also here figured. He mentions another case of one of 80 years, that had 140 found in his Gall-bladder, so lying, as that they hindred almost quite the Gall-passage,
which are figured here also. Some of these sometimes stops up the passage totally, as appears by the following case here recited. A young woman of 24, after obstructions and constipation of her Belly, died; her Gall-bladder was much extended, and filled with a large whitish Stone, which had hindered the passage of the Gall into the Gut. This is likewise figured here. These Gall-stones are known by flaming when put to the Fire, and swimming on water; for which reasons he suspects the *piedra del porco*, because it sinks in water, not to be of this kind. He gives the prognosticks of Diseases of the Bile, and so ends this small Treatise.

2. *Pharmacopoeia Harlemensis senatus auctoritate munita Harlemi apud Wilhelmum van Kessel, &c. 1693.* in 12°, pag. 113.

The Colledge of Physicians at Harlem, by the authority of the Magistrates of that Town, have ordered in this Book, what Simple and Compound Medicines the Apothcaries should have always ready to be used by them in their practice in diseased persons. They have not changed the compositions of Mithridate: and *Theriaca Androm*, but in some other Medicines they have left out what seem'd to be of a different operation from the other Simples in the same compound. They have not in measuring made use of handfuls or pugils, which they think varies too much, according to either the bigness of the hands, or the liberality or avarice of the seller; but have made use of pounds, ounces and drams in place of them. For the compositions the Book itself must be consulted.
