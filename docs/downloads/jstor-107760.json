And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued.\n\nBut the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable that a Committee of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752. And the grounds of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their respective authors.\n\nIt is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion,\nas a Body, upon any subject; either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore the thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communications. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions, and curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors whereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report, and even to certify in the public newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation. And therefore it is hoped, that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports and public notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited, to the dishonour of the Society.\nCONTENTS.\n\nI.

After these follows the geographical position of the Observatory. Observations of latitude in the southern hemisphere could best prove whether the difference usually found between the results derived from stars north of the zenith and those derived from stars south of the zenith, arise from local causes or from imperfections of the instruments. In the reductions of these observations, I have partly made use of the formula given by Bohnenberger in his \"Geographische Ortsbestimmung,\" § 153.\n\nThe repeating circle has been in constant use for twenty years, and the nonius of the smaller circle could not be made to close sufficiently to the greater circle. I ascribe it to this cause that the latitudes deduced from some of the observations made with this instrument deviate rather from the truth, the greater part of them having moreover been made without an assistant. The observations made alternately direct and by reflection show on the other hand great consistency; and as the results of these agree with the mean of the observations made with the former instrument on northern and southern stars, there is no doubt of this being the true latitude.\n\nI might have rejected those observations with the repeating circle that de-\nviated much from the mean; but I was of opinion that the true latitude was not the sole object of importance, but that it was also desirable to investigate the errors arising from flexibility, or causes not sufficiently known, to which repeating instruments are subject in the southern hemisphere in comparison with those that have been observed in the northern, which could only be effected by a thorough detail of the observations. The longitude of Paramatta is sufficiently known for geographical purposes; and having always objects of more immediate importance in hand, I was unwilling to devote much time to occultations of fixed stars, there being but little chance of corresponding ones being made in other places. But the occultations of the principal stars and planets have been attended to, as well as eclipses and observations of moon-culminating stars.\n\nI have next introduced the solstices observed with the repeating and mural circles at Paramatta. The vicinity of the sun to the zenith at the southern solstice rendered the usual methods of reduction insufficient, and a more correct one became necessary, which has already been partly published in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society. In the observations of the solstices, I had it also in view to ascertain whether the latitude derived from observations with the repeating circle with the known obliquity from the northern and southern solstice, would exhibit similar anomalies to those observed in Europe. The latitude of Paramatta by the northern solstice is about $4''$ less than what the southern gives, and the mean obliquity of the ecliptic as ascertained there by the repeating circle is $1''.7$ less than that found by the mural circle, which latter corresponds as nearly as possible with the solar tables.\n\nThe use of observations of the inferior conjunction of Venus and the opposition of Mars in that part of the world, as well as the culminations of the moon for determining their respective parallaxes, is obvious.\n\nObservations in the southern hemisphere of those errant bodies that cross our system in all directions from the arctic to the antarctic pole, are during this latter part of their orbit the more interesting, as they complete the series of observations made of them by European astronomers, to whom they are then invisible, or whose notice they may have entirely escaped. It was therefore south of the equator that I chiefly searched for comets. Much time was thus unsuccessfully spent, which I hope will not be perceived in the regular\nobservations with the transit and mural circle. The observations of the comet of 1825 have already appeared in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, where its positions are given according to La Caille's places of the compared stars. In the present work I have reduced them afresh by means of the places of these stars determined from my own observations, being desirous of giving here a complete view of the principal observations made at Paramatta.\n\nThe determination of the right ascensions of some of the principal stars of the southern hemisphere by equal as well as by absolute altitudes, has been the most laborious part of my observations. I have omitted the particulars, which would have filled pages void of interest to those who are in possession of more perfect transit instruments, or have the means at hand of correcting their defects. I am, however, not without hopes that the few right ascensions given by me, and which are independent of one another, are free from those small constant errors that cannot easily be discovered in transit instruments.\n\nNext follow the south polar distances of the circumpolar stars deduced from their upper and lower culminations. Of these I have given the original observations, in order to enable others to recompute them, to which they are in my opinion well entitled by their importance. The south polar distance of η Argus, β Crucis, and α Eridani, would probably be more correctly deduced from their upper culminations only, with the polar point derived from the other stars, whilst their lower culminations may serve to establish the law of refraction in the southern hemisphere. It would seem that the effects of the temperature and density of the atmosphere upon the refraction exceed the tabular corrections, which may be owing to a greater elasticity of the air in this warm climate. The conclusion makes a catalogue of the south polar distances of these stars with their constants of aberration and nutation.\n\nA future volume will contain a catalogue of the stars of the southern hemisphere, deduced from the observations with the transit and mural circle.\nCONTENTS.\n\nMagnetic Observations ........................................... page 1\nLatitude of the Observatory ...................................... 2\nLunar Observations.
