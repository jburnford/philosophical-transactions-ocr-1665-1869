I. An Account of the Discovery of a Comet. In a Letter from Miss Caroline Herschel, to Joseph Planta, Esq. Sec. R. S.

Read November 7, 1793.

SIR,

Last night I discovered a comet near 1st (δ) Ophiuchi, but clouds covering the part of the heavens where it was, its place could not be obtained.

My brother has just now (7 o'clock) determined its situation, as follows.

The comet precedes the 1st (δ) Ophiuchi 6′ 34″ in time, and is 1° 25′ more north than that star.

I remain, Sir, &c.

CAR. HERSCHEL.
