IV. Longitude found, by Henry Bond Senior, Teacher of the Mathe-
matics. London 1676. in 4o.

The Attempt and Pains of the Author of this Book are certainly
very commendable, forasmuch as he endeavours to explain to
us the Use of the Inclinatory Needle, and in so doing makes it known
to the world, that, as both the Variation and Inclination of the Needle
were found out first of all in this Nation by two Englishmen, Mr. Ro-
bert Norman and Mr. William Burrows; so he (our Author) hath now
made it his business to apply it to an Use, formerly, for ought we
know, not thought of, viz. To find the Longitude. Which how he per-
forms and makes good, is left to the Sagacious Reader to judge.

Mean time, the Publisher is desired, here, to take notice of a
mistake committed in this Book, viz. in the page printed next after
the Epistle to the Reader; where 'tis said, that This Treatise hath been
examined by six Commissioners appointed by the King, and the Truth of it
affirmed to his Majesty: Whereas of the six persons there named, the
Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Brouncker, Chancellor to her
Majesty, and President to the R. Society, declareth, that he never so
much as saw this Treatise before it was printed, nor was ever present
at any of the Meetings of the other Commissioners; the Quality of
the report of whom concerning this matter the Reader will doubtless
be acquainted with in due time.

V. The Royal Almanack: By N. Stephenson, one of his Majesties
Gunners. London 1677. in 12o.

This Almanack is a very useful Diary of the true places of the
Sun, Moon, and other Planets; their Rising, Southing, and Set-
ting; as also of High-water at London-bridge, with Rules to serve other
places after the New Theory of Tides, and Directions of Sir Jonas
Moore. To which are added the Eclipses, with a Table of Equations
for the regulating curious Pendulum-Clocks, and Movements to the
Sun: Likewise, a Table of the Suns right Ascension in time for every
day at Noon, and of Thirty of the most notable Fixed Stars: Toget-
her with the Moons and the other Planets Appulses to the Fixed
Stars, for the Meridian of London, in the year 1677; as also a Transit
of Mercury under the Sun, calculated for Octob. 28. next. All done
with great care and pains at his Majesties command.
