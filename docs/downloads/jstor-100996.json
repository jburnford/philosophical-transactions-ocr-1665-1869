GUGAGING PROMOTED, being an Appendix to Stereometrical Propositions formerly publish't by Rob. Anderson.\n\nInstructions Concerning the Use of Pendulum-Watches, for finding the Longitude at Sea.\n\nWhereas'tis generally esteemed that there is no Practice for the Finding of the Longitude at sea comparable to that of those Watches, which instead of a Ballance-wheele are regulated by a Pendulum, as now they are brought to great perfection, and made to measure time very equally; and many perhaps here as well\nwell as elsewhere being not well versed in the ordering and managing of that Instrument: We thought, it might be no un-acceptable service, to make known such Directions, as may teach the Use thereof at Sea. Which we shall doe by now giving you our Translation of those instructions, which some yeares since were made publick by the Worthy M. Christian Hugens of Zulechem, in the Belgick Tongue, as they have been since altered or rather enlarged by two other Eminent Members of the R. Society.\n\nAnd they are these;\n\n1. Those, that intend to make use of Pendulum-watches at Sea, must have two of them at least; that, if one of them should by mishap or neglect come to stop, or (being by length of time become foul) need to be made clean, there may likely always remaine one in motion.\n\n2. The Person, to whom the Care of these Watches shall be committed, is to informe himself from the Watch-maker or some other, so as to understand the inward parts of the Watches, the manner of winding them up, and how to set the Indexes, or Hands having the hours, minutes and seconds, &c.\n\n3. The Watches on Ship-board are to be hung in a close place, where they may be freest from moisture or dust, and out of danger of being disorder'd by knocking or touching.\n\n4. Before the Watches be brought on ship-board, 'tis convenient, they be adjusted to a middle or mean day (of which more in the next Section:) the use of them being then most easy, it being little or no trouble to the Watchmakers, when they have one that is set just, to set others accordingly: But yet, if time or conveniency so to doe should happen to be wanting, they may notwithstanding be used at Sea with the like certainty, provided you know, how much they goe too fast or too slow in 24. hours, as is directed in the next Section.\n5.\n\nTo reduce Watches to the right measure of days, or to know how much they go too fast or too slow in 24 hours.\n\nHere take notice, that the Sun or the Earth passeth the 12 Signes, or makes an entire revolution in the Ecliptick in 365 days, 5 hours, 49 min, or there about, and that those days reckon'd from noon to noon, are of different lengths; as is known to all, that are vers'd in Astronomy. Now between the longest and the shortest of those days, a day may be taken of such a length, as 365 such days, 5 hours &c. (the same numbers as before) make up, or are equall to that revolution: And this is call'd the Equal or Mean day, according to which the Watches are to be set; and therefore the Hour or Minute shew'd by the Watches, though they be perfectly just and equal, must needs differ almost continually from those that are shew'd by the Sun, or are reckon'd according to its Motion. But this Difference is regular, and is otherwise call'd the Equation, and here you have a Table, that shows it.\n| Januar | Februar | März | April | Mai | Juni

precisely, and consequently, whether the Watches have been set to the right measure of the Mean day, or no; using the Table, as follows.\n\nWhen you first set your Watch by the Sun, you are to subduct from the time observed by the Sun, the Equation adjoyned to that day of the Month in the Table, and to set the Watches to the remaining hours, minutes and seconds, that is, the Watches are to be set so much slower, than the time of the Sun, as (in the Table) is the Equation of that day; so that the Equation of the Day, added to the time of the Clock, is the true time by the Sun. And when after some days, you desire to know by the Watch the time by the Sun, you are to add to the time, shew'd by the Watch, the Equation of that day, and the Aggregate shall be the time by the Sun, if the Watch hath been perfectly well adjusted after the measure of the Mean days; for the doing of which, this will be a Convenient way;\n\nDraw a Meridian line upon a floor (the manner of doing which is sufficiently known; and note, that the utmost exactness herein is not necessary;) and then hang two plummets, each by a small thread or wire, directly over the said Meridian, at the distance of some 2. foot or more one from the other, as the smallness of the thread will admit. When the middle of the Sun (the Eye being placed so, as to bring both the threads into one line) appears to be in the same line exactly (for the better and more secure discerning whereof, you must be furnish't with a glass of a dark colour, or somewhat blackt with the smoak of a Candle,) you are then immediately to set the Watch, not precisely to the hour of 12. but by so much less, as is the Equation of that day by the Table. E.g. If it were the 12 of March, the Equation of that day being by the Table, 8 min. 3 sec.; these are to be subducted from 12. hours, and the remainder will be 11. hours, 51. min. 57. sec.; to which hours, minutes and seconds you are to set the Index of the Watch respectively: Then after some days you are to observe again in the same manner, and likewise to note the hour, min. and sec. of the Watch; to which you are to add the Equation\nEquation of these days, taken out of the Table; And if the Aggregate doe just make 12 hours, the Watch is set adjusted to the right measure; but if it differ, you are to divide the minutes and seconds of that difference by the number of the days between both the Observations, to get the daily difference. Let us suppose, this second Observation to have been made the 20. of March, viz. 8. days after the first, and finding, that the Middle of the Sun being seen in the Meridian in the same line with the two thirds, as before, the Watch points 11—51—7.\n\nThe Equation of the 20 of March, by the Table, is---0---10--40. Which being added to the time, show'd by the Watch, gives\n\nIf this had been just 12 hours, the Watch would have been well adjusted, but being 1. min. 47. sec. more than 12, it hath gone so much too fast in 8. days. And these 1 min. 47. sec. that is, 107. sec. being divided by 8, there comes 13½ sec. for the difference of every 24. hours; which difference being known, if you want time, or have no mind to take the pains to adjust the Watch to its right measure (this being not necessary, since you may bring it thus on ship-board) note only the daily difference, and regulate yourself accordingly, as hath been mentioned. But if you will adjust it better, you must remove the less weight of the Pendulum a little downwards, which will make it go slower; and then you must begin to observe anew by the Sun, as before. If it had gone too slow, you must have remov'd the mention'd weight somewhat upwards. And this is of that importance in the finding out of Longitudes, that, if it be not observ'd, you may sometimes in the space of 3 months misreckon 7. degrees and more (yet without any fault in the Watches;) which under the Tropicks will amount to above 400 English miles.\n\nHaving shew'd, How the Watches may be adjusted at Land, or how their daily difference may be known; next shall follow, How the same may be done, when a Vessel rides at anchor, it being hardly feasible when she is under sail.\n\nIn the morning then, when the sun is just half above the Horizon, note, what hour, min. and sec. the Watch points at,\nif it be going; if not, set it a going, and put the Indexes at what hour, min. and sec. you please. Let them goe till Sun-set, and when the Body of the Sun is just half under the Horizon, see, what hour, min. and sec. the Indexes of the Watch point at, and note them too; and reckon, how many hours &c. are Pass'd by the Watch between the one and the other: which is done by adding to the Evening-observation the hours, &c. that the morning-Observation wanted of 12. or 24. in case the Hour-hand hath in the mean time pass'd that hour once or twice; otherwise the difference only gives the time. Then take the half of that number, and add it to the hours, &c. of the morning-Observation, and you shall have the hours, &c. which the Watch did show, when the Sun was in the South; whereunto add the Equation in the Table belonging to that day, and note the summe. Then some days being pass'd (the more the better,) you are to doe just the same: And if the hour of this last day be the same, that was noted before, your Watch is well adjusted; but if it be more or less, the difference divided by the number, elapsed between the two Observations, will give the daily difference. And if you will, you may let it rest there, or otherwise, removing the lesser weight of the Pendulum you may adjust it better.\nE. g. Suppose March 11th in the Morning, when\nthe Sun half appears above the Horizon, the\nWatch points at\n\nIn the Evening, when the Sun appears half set, at\nTo know by the Watch the time elaps'd between\nboth, subduct the time of the rising\n\nFrom\n\nRefts\n\nWhereunto adding the time of the setting\n\nThere comes for the time elapsed between them\n\nWhereof the half is\n\nWhich added to the time of the Sun's rising\n\nThere comes the time of the Watch when the\nSun was in the South\n\nTo which adding the Equation of the 11th of March\n\nThe Summe is\n\nSeven days after, viz. March 18, let the rising of the\nSun be observ'd, and the Watch point then at\n\nAnd at his setting, let the Watch point at\n\nTo find the time elaps'd between them, subduct\nthe time of the rising\n\nFrom\n\nRefts\n\nTo which add the time of the setting\n\nAnd you'll find the time past between them\n\nWhereof the half is\n\nWhich added to the time of the rising\n\nAnd you have the time when the Sun was in the South\n\nWhereunto adding the Equation of March 18\n\nThe Summe is\n\nWhich Summe if it had agreed with the first, viz.\n\nthen, had the watch been set to the right measure; but seeing the latter is less than the former, the difference being\n49. sec; the Watch hath by so much, in 7. days, gone too slow; which 49 sec. divided by the number of days, you have\n7 sec. for the daily difference; and by so much the Watch goes too slow in 24. hours.\n\nYou may also, instead of the Sun's rising and setting, take two equall Altitudes of the Sun, before and after Noon, and having noted the time given by the Watches at the time of both the Observations, proceed with it in the same manner, as was just now directed for observing the Sun in the Horizon. In either of which ways there may be some Error, caused by\nthe Sun's Refraction, which is inconsiderable, and therefore needs not to be taken notice of.\n\n6.\n\nBy means of these Watches to find at Sea the Longitude of the Place, where you are.\n\nGive to each of the Watches a name or a mark, as A, B, C; and before you set sail, set them to the time observed by the Sun in the place, where you are, and whence you are departing, allowing for the Equation of the day, whereon you make your Observation; Which day you are to note, if the Watches be not well adjusted; otherwise it is not necessary.\n\nThen afterwards being at Sea, and desiring to know the Longitude of the place where you are, that is, how many degrees the Meridian of that place is more Easterly or Westerly, than the Meridian of that place where you did set the Watches; you must observe by the Sun or Stars, what time of the day it is, as precisely as is possible, and note at the same time, to what hour, minutes and sec, the Watches doe point (which time, if the Watches be not set to the right measure, is by the known daily difference to be adjusted,) adding thereunto the Equation of the present day, which gives you the time of the day, shew'd by the Sun, at the place where the Watches were set: And if this time of the day be the same with that observ'd where you are, then you are under the same Meridian with the place, where the Watches were set by the Sun; but if the time of the day, observ'd where you are, be greater than that shew'd by the Watches, you may be assur'd, that you are come under a more Easterly Meridian; and if less, you are come under a more Westerly. And counting for every hour of difference of time, 15 degrees of Longitude, and for every minute, 15 minutes or ¼ of a degree, you shall then know, how many degrees, minutes, &c. the said Meridians doe differ from one another.\n\nE.g. Suppose, the Watches A, B, C, were set at the place, whence you parted, on the 20 of February, to the time of day observ'd by the Sun, abating the Equation of the 20th of Febr. (viz 2 min, 28. sec.) and suppose that the Watch A, be set\nset to its right measure, but that B. goes every day 7 sec. too slow, and C. every day 12 sec. too fast. Some days after, suppose the 5th of May, desiring to know the Longitude of the place where you are at Sea, you observe the time of the day there to be\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nAnd you find the Watch A. to point at\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nBut the Watch B. to point at\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nGoing too slow by 7 sec. every day, which makes in 74 days,\n\n(viz.\n\nFrom the 20th of Febr. to the 5th of May)\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nWhich being added to its own time, gives the same\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nwith that of the Watch A., viz.\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nYou find also the Watch C. to point at\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nGoing 12 sec. too fast every day, which makes in 74 days\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nWhich being subducted from its own\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\ngives again\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nThe time of day therefore by the Watches being\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nAdd thereunto the Equation of the 5th of May\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nAnd so you have for the time of day at the place\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nwhere the Watches were set\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nBut the time observ'd being\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nExceeds this by\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nWherefore the Meridian of the place, where you are May 5th, is more Easterly, than the places\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nwhere the Watches were set, by\n\n| h. | min. | sec. |\n|----|-----|-----|\n|    |     |     |\n\nWhich being reduced to degrees, reckoning\n\n| deg. | m. | d. |\n|------|---|---|\n|      |   |   |\n\n15 deg. for an hour, comes to\n\n| deg. | m. | d. |\n|------|---|---|\n|      |   |   |\n\nTis true, that from the same reckoning it may be concluded, that you are 18 deg. more Easterly, which happens because the Hour-Index goes round in the space of 12 hours in the Watches; but the difference is so great, that one cannot be deceiv'd in it; else the Watch might be so made, that the Index shall goe round but once in 24 hours.\n\nTo find the time of the Day at Sea.\n\nSince that for finding the Longitude, the Time of the day\nat the place where you are must be known (as hath been said above) you must have a care to observe that time as precisely as is possible. For every minute of time, that you misreckon, makes a 4th part of a degree in longitude, which amounts, near the Equator, to above 15 English miles, but less elsewhere. Wherefore to find the time of the day with certainty, you are not to trust to the Observation of the Suns greatest Altitude, thence to conclude that 'tis just Noon, or that the Sun is in the South, unless, being betwixt the Tropicks, you have it just in the Zenith. For else the Sun being near the Meridian, remains for some time without any sensible alteration of its Altitude. Wherefore, though the Meridian Altitude may serve well enough for knowing the Latitude or the Hight of the Pole upon occasion; yet it will not serve for finding precisely the Longitude of that place. Much less are you to rely upon the Sea-compasses, thereby to find the precise time of Noon. Neither are the Astronomical Rings or other sorts of Sundials sure enough for shewing the time to minutes and seconds. But it is better to observe the Suns Altitude, when 'tis in the East or West, (the nearer, the better:) for being there, its Altitude changes in a short time more sensibly than before or after; and thus from the Hight of the Pole, and the Declination of the Sun the Hour may be calculated; the manner whereof is sufficiently taught by others; yet by reason that this Calculation is somewhat troublesome, and that also there may be some Errors in the taking of the Suns Altitude, here follows an easier way.\n\n8.\n\nHow by Observing the Rising and Setting of the Sun, and the Time by the Watches, the Longitude at Sea may be found.\n\nThis way doth neither require the Knowledg of the Hight of the Pole, nor of the Declination of the Sun, nor the Use of any Astronomical Instruments: Neither can the Refractions of the Sun or Stars cause any considerable Error; the refraction of the Morning differing but little or nothing from that of the Evening of one and the same day, especially at Sea. Thus then you are to proceed,\nAt the Rising and Setting of the Sun, when it is half above the Horizon, marke the time of the day, which the Watches, then shew; and though you have in the mean time say'd on, it is not considerable. Then reckon by the Watches, what time is elap'sd between them, and add the half thereof to the time of the Rising, and you shall have the time by the Watches, when the Sun was at South; to which is to be added the Aequation of the present day by the Table. And if this together makes 12 hours, then was the Ship at Noon under the same Meridian, where the Watches were set with the Sun. But if the summe be more than 12, then was she at Noon under a more Wasterly Meridian; and if less, then under a more Easterly; and that by as many times 15 degrees, as that Summ exceeds or comes short hours of 12: as the Calculation thereof hath been already deliver'd.\n\nSuppose, e.g., that the Watches A and B, as before, were set with the Sun at the place whence you parted, the 20th of Febr.; and the Indexes set to the Hour, min, and second, shewed by the Sun, abating the Aequation of that day, viz. 2 min. and 20 seconds; the Watch A being reduc'd to the right measure, and B going too slow by 7 sec. a day. Afterwards on the 22th of May, desiring to know the Longitude of the place, to which you are come, you observe in the Morning the Sun half above the Horizon when the Watch points at 2---30---10\n\nAnd in the Evening, the Sun being half under the Horizon, when the same Watch points at ---3---8---40\n\nTo find the Time elap'sd between them, sub-\n\nducting the time of the Rising\n\nFrom ---12---0\n\nThere remains ---9---29---50\n\nAdding thereunto the time of the Setting ---3---8---40\n\nYou have for the time elap'sd between the Observations ---12---38---30\n\nWhereof the half ---6---19---15\n\nBeing added to the time of Rising ---2---30---10\n\nYou have the time by the Watch A, when the Sun was in the South ---8---49---25\n\nAnd\nAnd after the same manner you are to seek the time by the Watch B, when the Sun was in the South; which let be\n\nBut this Watch going 7 sec. a day too slow, it is retarded in 91 days, (from the 20th of Febr. to the 22 of May) Which therefore added to the said time gives\n\nThat is the same time given by the Watch A. Now adding to this time of the Watches, the Equation of the 22th of May\n\nYou have\n\nWhich is the same time of the day with that of the place, where the Watches were set when the Sun was in the same Meridian with the Ship, or where the Ship was at Noon.\n\nThe difference is\n\nWherefore this last Meridian is by so much more Easterly, than the first; which being reduc'd to degrees (as hath been formerly directed) make\n\n'Tis manifest, that by this way you find precisely enough the Longitude of the place, where you were at Noon, or the Time of the Suns being in the South: which, although it differs from the Longitude of the place, where you are when you observe the Setting of the Sun, yet you may estimate near enough, how much you have advanc'd, or chang'd the Longitude in those few hours, by the Log-line, or other Ordinary practises of reckoning the Ships way, or (which is the surer way) by the degrees pass'd in 24 hours by a former days Observation.\n\nYou may also, instead of observing the Suns Rising and Setting, observe the Setting first, and then next morning the Rising; marking at both times the time show'd by the Watches; and find thence, after the same manner as before, the Longitude of the place where the Ship was at Midnight.\n\nFinally, you may also, instead of the Rising and Setting of the Sun, observe before and after Noon two equal Altitudes of the Sun, noting the time shown by the Watches, and reckoning in the same manner, as hath been said of the Rising and Setting: Yet it is to be consider'd, that the Altitudes of the Sun\nSun are best taken, when it is about East and West, as hath been already intimated. But note, that in Sailing North and South you make not the Observations at the Suns rising and setting, but at its being due East and West.\n\n9.\n\nBut you may, especially in such Quarters, as lyeth North or South, yea and wherever you will, put the Rule here prescribed in practice, by taking 2 equal Altitudes of some known Starr, that riseth high above the Horizon. For you shall thence, according to the mention'd Rule, know at what time by the Watches the Starr hath been in the South; and so the Right Ascension of that Starr being known, as also the Right Ascension of the Sun, you may thence easily calculate, what time it then was: Which being compar'd with the time of the Watches, as before, shall give the Longitude of the place where you were, when you had the Starr in the Meridian.\n\n10.\n\nIf the Watches, that have gone exactly for a while, should come to differ from one another (as in length of time it may well happen, that the one or the other faile a minute, more or less;) in that case it will be best to reckon by that, which goes fastest; unless you perceive an apparent cause, why it goes too fast; seeing it is not so easy for these Pendulum-Watches to move faster than at first, as it is to go slower. For, the Wire, on which the Pendulum hangs, may perhaps by the violent agitation of the Ship come to stretch a little, but it cannot grow shorter; and the little Weight of the Pendulum perhaps slip downwards, but cannot get up higher.\n\n11.\n\nWhen you get sight of any known Country, Island or Coast, be sure to note the Longitude thereof as exactly as you can by the help of the Rules here prescribed. First, thereby to correct the Sea-Maps, after that the Longitude of a place shall have been found at divers times to be the same, so that you doubt no more of it. For all Maps are very defective as to the Situation of Places in respect of East and West, chiefly where Seas are interposed. Secondly, to be able always to know in the prosecution of your Journey, how far you have fail'd from any\nany place to the East or West. And if by any notable mischance or carelesness all the Watches should come to stand still, yet you may at any place, whereof the Longitude is certainly known, set them a going again, and adjust them there by the Sun, and so reckon the Longitudes from that same Meridian. For, you are to know, that you are nor at all obliged to put one certain Meridian of any known place as a beginning of the Longitude-reckoning; this hapening only in Maps, or Tables of Longitude: As, when you take for that purpose the Meridian of the Pico in Teneriffe, or that of the Islands of Corvo and Flores (the most Westerly of the Azores) or any others. Yet it were very fit, that all Geographers agreed and pitched upon one and the same First Meridian, that so all places might be known by the same Degrees as well of Longitude as of Latitude; though in Voyaging it is sufficient, to observe only the difference of Longitudes, beginning to reckon from the Meridian of any place, you please, as if it were the first.\n\n12.\n\nIf it happen, that being at Sea all the Watches stopp, you must, as speedily as is possible, set them a moving again, that you may know, how much you advance from that place towards the East or West: Which is of no small importance, since, for want of this knowledge, you are sometimes by the force of Currents so carried away, that though you saile before the Wind, yet you are driven a Stern; of which there are many Examples.\n\nThe Method\n\nOf a Journal for the Watches.\n\nThe Watches being distinguished by marks as A, B, or the like, every day about Noon, or when most conveniently you can, observe the time of the day by the Sun, or by the Stars at night, and subduct thence the minutes and seconds, that are adjoyn'd to that day in the Table, and write the remainder down in a paper, wherein 9 Columns or more are mark't, placing them in the second column, having plac'd the day of the Month in the first. And at the same time write down the hours, minutes and seconds of each Watch in a distinct Column, all opposite\nposite one to another. Then in another Column write downe\nthe difference between the time taken by Observation, and\nthat given by the Watches or one of them. Then, one Column\nfor the Latitude: one, for the Longitude by the Ordinary\nway of reckoning: another, for the Longitude taken from the\ndifference between the time found by Observation, and that given\nby the Watches: and at last, a large Column to note the\nAccidentes, that befell the Watches, &c.\n\nAn Extract of a Letter\nWritten by Dr. Edward Brown from Vienna in Austria March\n3. 1669. concerning two Parhelia's or Mocksuns, lately seen in\nHungary.\n\nI received the account of the Parhelia's, seen January 30th\nlast, st.n.about one of the clock in the afternoon, over the City\nof Cassovia in Hungary. It was communicated to me from a\nLearn'd Jesuit, call'd Father Michel, who lives at Pressburg, but\nis now in this City. There were two Parhelia's, one on each\nside of the true Sun, and they were so refulgent, that the na-\nked Eye could not bear the brightness thereof. One of them\n(the lesser of the two) began to decay before the other, and\nthen the other grew bigger, and continued well nigh two hours,\nprojecting very long rays from itself. They were both on that\npart, which was towards the Sun, tinged with a pale yellow,\nthe other parts being somewhat fuscous. There were at the\nsame time seen several Rainbows, together with the Segment\nof a great white Circle, of a long duration, passing through the\ntwo Parhelia's and the Sun: and all this at a time, when the\nAir was almost free from Clouds, though here and there were\nscatter'd some very thin ones.\n\nA Relation\nOf the Conferences held at Paris in the Academy Royal for the\nimprovement of the Arts of Painting and Sculpture, as it is\nfound in the Journal des Scavans.\n\nThese Conferences are held once in a Month by divers Able\nMasters making reflexions and observations upon the rarest\npieces in the Cabinet of his Most Christian Majesty, the Esta-\nblisher\nand Sciences, all that time, which they spend in acquiring the Latin Tongue.\n\nAdvertisements,\n\n1. The Reader is desired, to insert in Numb.47. p.951. sect. 10. after these words, Why it goes too fast, this Note (as it may happen, when by some accident the Cheeks retaine not their proper figures.) And now if it should be said, that upon any foulness the Watch will goe faster by reason of the shorter Vibrations of the Pendulum, it is to be considered, That this is only true when the Watches have no Cheeks, but when they have them (as in those hitherto used) 'tis not so.\n\n2. If it should be demanded, Why in the same Tract use hath not been made of Tycho's Equation of Time, nor of that of Bullialdus, but one is given different from both? The Answer is, That the Table, there publish'd, is the Difference of the Right Ascension of the Sun at Noon from the Mean motion, accounting from th' 1st of February; which must be the true Equation; unless the Velocity of the Earth's Motion about her own Axis be not constantly the same.\n\nErrat.\n\nNumb. 47.p. 945. in the 2d column blot out diff. before 6. 5. 1. and put it before the 3d rank of numbers above it, viz. before 11. 49. 56.\n\nLONDON,\nPrinted by T.
