I take this opportunity to acquaint you with a strange phenomenon of the lake Ontario, where general Shirley has posted himself with two thousand men, at fort Oswego.

A considerable number of people were affected with a kind of vertigo, without being sensible of the earthquake. It was felt throughout the whole territories of this republic.
