Astronomical Observations, made in the Forks of the River Brandywine in Pennsylvania, for determining the going of a Clock sent thither by the Royal Society, in order to find the Difference of Gravity between the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the Place where the Clock was set up in Pennsylvania; to which are added, an Observation of the End of an Eclipse of the Moon, and some Immersions of Jupiter's First Satellite observed at the same Place in Pennsylvania: By Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon.\n\nRead December 15, 1768.\n\nThe Place where these Observations were made is the Northernmost Point of the Lines that were measured for a Degree of Latitude, or Point N. (see Tab. XIII. fig. 2.) relative to that Measure; it lies 31 Miles West, by Measurement; and 10°,5 South of the Southernmost Point of the City of Philadelphia, as found by the Sector.\n\n| Year | Month | Day | Time per Clock |\n|------|-------|-----|----------------|\n| 1766 | Decemb. | 24 | 4 28 40 |\n|      |       |     | 30 18+ 5 25 3 |\n|      |       |     | 32 5½ 26 40 |\n|      |       | 28 | 4 28 41 |\n|      |       |     | 30 22+ 5 20 59 |\n|      |       |     | 32 10 24 30½ |\n|      |       | 30 | 4 5 52½ |\n|      |       |     | 7 12 44 46½ |\n|      |       |     | 8 34 46 4½ |\n\n1767\n\nJanuary.\n\n| Year | Month | Day | Time per Clock |\n|------|-------|-----|----------------|\n|      |       | 4   | 10 33 5 37 45 |\n|      |       | 11  | 55 39 10 |\n|      |       | 13  | 19½ 40 31- |\n\nEqual Altitudes of ditto.\n| Date | Time per Clock |\n|------|---------------|\n| January |               |\n| 7    | 3 50 26       |\n|      | 51 39+       |\n|      | 52 56½       |\n| 8    | 4 48         |\n|      | 6 7½         |\n|      | 7 30—        |\n| 10   | 6 21 28      |\n|      | 22 43        |\n|      | 24 00        |\n| 16   | 4 5 4+       |\n|      | 6 25         |\n|      | 7 50         |\n| 19   | 4 8½         |\n|      | 5 27½        |\n|      | 6 52         |\n| 27   | 3 32 53      |\n|      | 34 5—        |\n|      | 35 19½       |\n| February |             |\n| 3    | 4 21 12½     |\n|      | 22 22        |\n|      | 23 35+       |\n| 4    | 3 34 52—     |\n|      | 36 5         |\n|      | 37 20        |\n| 8    | 3 55 32      |\n|      | 56 50+       |\n|      | 58 12        |\n| 16   | 13 44 50     |\n|      | 13 46 25     |\n| 25   | 4 11 43—     |\n|      | 13 21        |\n|      | 15 7—        |\n| 10   | 42 50—       |\n\nEqual altitudes of Capella.\n\nEqual altitudes of ditto.\n\nThe first Satellite of Jupiter immersed.\n\nApparent time 8 17 42 47½\n\nEqual altitudes of Castor.\n\nThe first Satellite of Jupiter immersed.\n\nApparent time 10 12 10 23.\n\nEqual altitudes of Capella.\n\nEqual altitudes of ditto.\n\nEqual altitudes of ditto.\n\nEqual altitudes of Capella.\n\nEqual altitudes of ditto.\n\nThe first Satellite of Jupiter was not immersed by clouds.\n\nDitto was immersed.\n\nEqual altitudes of Capella.\n\nFirst Satellite of ¼ immersed.

B. The edge of the earth’s shadow on the D’s disk was the best defined I ever saw: it was remarkably distinct from the penumbral shade.\n\nN. B. The clock was firmly screwed to a piece of timber, 22 inches in breadth, and five inches and a quarter thick; the said piece of timber was let four feet into the ground, which was composed of a very firm, dry, hard clay.\n\nThe clock was placed in a tent, with Fahrenheit’s thermometer hung to its side; and a blanket was wrapped round the clock and thermometer, to secure it from any wind that might enter the tent. The pendulum was adjusted to the upper scratch, with No. 3. at the Index, as directed by the Rev. Mr. Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal: but the spring at the suspension of the pendulum having been broke, (when the ship, in which it was sent, was wrecked on the Jersey coast) we cannot be certain that the pendulum is now of the same length as it was when sent from London.\n\nThose observations marked : are a little dubious; those marked :: are very dubious; those marked . . * were made per Mr. Dixon. The eclipses of U’s satellites were observed with a reflecting telescope of one foot focus, that magnified about 70 times.\n\n| Year | Month | Height of the ther. at about 7h in the mor. in the Tent | Height of the ther. at about 2h in the after. in the Tent | Vibration of the pend. on each side of O., that is, half the arch of vibration. |\n|------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1766 | Decemb. | 24 .. .. 43 45-                                          | 25 .. .. 44 46                                           | 26 38 37 45 47 1 40-                                                         |\n|      |       | 27 38 41 40 42                                           |                                                          |                                                                             |\n|      |       | 28 21 18 31 26 1 35 Near midn. the ther. in the Tent 20 Air 16 | 29 28 28 At 10h P.
