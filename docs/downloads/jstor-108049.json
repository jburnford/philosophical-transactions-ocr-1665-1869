  "text": "ADVERTISEMENT.\n\nThe Committee appointed by the Royal Society to direct the publication of the Philosophical Transactions, take this opportunity to acquaint the Public, that it fully appears, as well from the council-books and journals of the Society, as from repeated declarations which have been made in several former Transactions, that the printing of them was always, from time to time, the single act of the respective Secretaries, till the Forty-seventh Volume: the Society, as a Body, never interesting themselves any further in their publication, than by occasionally recommending the revival of them to some of their Secretaries, when, from the particular circumstances of their affairs, the Transactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted. And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued.\n\nBut the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable that a Committee of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752. And the grounds of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgement of their respective authors.\n\nIt is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body,\nupon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore\nthe thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors\nof such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through\nwhose hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a\nmatter of civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communi-\ncations. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions,\nand curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors\nwhereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report and even to\ncertify in the public newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and\napprobation. And therefore it is hoped that no regard will hereafter be paid to such\nreports and public notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited,\nto the dishonour of the Society.\nI.
