rated, and diffused in their Medium: Of their difference to the Organ of Hearing; together with their Reception there, and wonderful Effects: Of the Matter, Form, Quantity, and Quality of Musical Bodies or Sounds: That Musical Sounds are originally in the Radix or Unison; and of their Fluxion out of it: Of the General and Special Kinds, Differences, Properties and Accidents of Sounds: Of the Truth and Falshood of Sounds.

2. Of the Principles of the Mathematical Part of Musick: Of the Whole, and Parts of the Scale of Musick: Of Sounds Equal and Unequal: Of the Numeration, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division of Musical Sounds: Of Musical Proportions, and their various Species's: What a Musical Body or Sound Mathematically considered, viz. as Numerable, is: Of Musical Medieties, &c. Arithmetical, Geometrical and Harmonical, together with 8 other Musical Medieties, of which no mention being made by any Musical Author: Of the Radix's of Musical Numbers; and that by their Powers all those Numbers, (and no other,) which demonstrate the Proportions of Sounds, do arise: Of Musick Diatonic, Chromatic, and Enharmonic: Of the Principles of a Musical Magnitude, what and how manifold they are, and how they are conjoined: Of the Contact, Section, Congruity, Adscription of a Musical Body: Of the Commensurability thereof: In what respect a Musical Sound may be said to be Infinite, and how to bound that Infinity.

4. The Abstruse and Difficult Terms of this Science are explained: The unnecessary and mystical subtleties, into which the Causes both of the Theory and Practice of Musick were reduced to the great obscuring of this Art, are omitted: The Principles of Philosophy, Mathematicks, Grammar, Rhetoric and Poetry are applied to Musical Sounds, and illustrated by them: The Generation of such Sounds is discours'd of, and particularly demonstrated.

5. An easy way is by this Author invented for making Airy Tunes of all sorts by a certain Rule (which most men think impossible to be done;) and the Composing of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7 Parts; which by the Learner may be performed in a few months: viz. in two months he may exquisitely and with all the Elegancies of Musick compose two parts; in three months, three Parts, and so forward; as he affirms many persons of honor and worth have often experienced; which otherwise cannot be done in so many years.

6. Whatsoever is grounded upon the several Hypotheses and Postulata of this Book, is clearly demonstrated by Tables, Diagrams, Systems, &c.
