S.\n\nRead May 20, 1790.\n\nAs perhaps this Paper may be thought of some use, I beg you will do me the favour of presenting it to the Royal Society. Its principal object is to settle the longitude and latitude of several remarkable places near the Severn, the relative distances of which I measured trigonometrically during my stay in Glamorganshire. As they are all deduced from Frampton-house, it is requisite to determine the position of that place with correctness. My father has already given its longitude in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LXXI. being the mean of several observations of Jupiter's first and second satellites. From the known ability of the observer, we may undoubtedly depend that all possible exactness was obtained, of which those observations are susceptible; but at that time the superior accuracy of the lunar transits was not known; therefore at present there can be no hesitation in giving the preference to the following results.\nMr. Pigott's Determination of the Longitudes and\n\nDifference of longitudes in time between Greenwich and Frampton-house, deduced from observed meridian transits of the moon's limbs.\n\n| Dates       | Difference of meridians, west. | Stars observed with D.

The\npreceding additional set of results do further corroborate the\nreliance that may be put on it, though the observations were\nnot made with that intention, and consequently several of\nthem are deficient in many particulars: their agreement, never-\ntheless, is conclusive, and infinitely more satisfactory than\ncould be expected. Since the above-mentioned publication I\nhave been informed, that M. le Marquis de Chabert and\nothers, many years ago, settled differences of meridians on\nsimilar principles, and I dare say with as much sagacity as the\nthen imperfect state of the method would permit. At present\nit is certainly considerably improved, being susceptible of very\ngreat exactness and facility, which perhaps may be considered\nas the sole requisites for rendering it any wise useful.\n\nThe latitude of the same place, taken with an 18-inch\nquadrant made by Bird, is thus by my observations:\nMr. Pigott's Determination of the Longitudes and\n\n51° 25' 0\" by β Geminorum.\n51° 24' 50\" by ε Bootis; two observations.\n51° 25' 5\" by π Sagittarii.\n51° 25' 13\" by γ Virginis.\n51° 24' 55\" by η Bootis; two observations.\n51° 24' 48\" by γ Delphini.\n51° 24' 56\" by Fomalhaut.\n\n51° 24' 58\" + on a mean.\n\n51° 25' 1\" { ditto, by my father, with the same instrument.\nSee Phil.

As the view from its extremities was very confined, another base of 1861 yards was deduced from it, situated on the high lands that edge the Severn, having a very extensive and beautiful prospect. From the extremities of this second base, all the angles were taken with a tolerably good theodolite on which two minutes might be easily read off. The results here given are the distances from the various places to the western extremity of their base, their perpendicular distances to its meridian, and its distance from these perpendiculars.\n\nDistances\n### Distances in yards\n\n| Direct. | To the meridian. | To the perpendicular. |\n|---------|------------------|----------------------|\n| 3307    | 1254 E           | 3059 N               |\n| 45654   | 42239 E          | 17324 S              |\n| 30928   | 21853 E          | 29768 S              |\n| 40446   | 15586 E          | 37322 S              |\n| 35543   | 11542 E          | 33617 S              |\n| 21911   | 1465 E           | 21862 S              |\n| 21336   | 6604 W           | 20268 S              |\n| 30238   | 23152 W          | 19450 S              |\n| 46264   | 40308 W          | 22547 S              |\n| 2921    | 2842 W           | 673 N                |\n| 1564    | 491 E            | 1483 N               |\n| 10140   | 448 W            | 10130 N              |\n| 25126   | 2299 E           | 25020 N              |\n| 3135    | 2063 E           | 2361 N               |\n| 8864    | 5906 E           | 6609 N               |\n\nFrampton-house.\nBrin Hill, the center.\nQuantock Hill, the east part.\nLand Mark, a tower.\nWatchet Hill, the center.\nMinehead.\nPorlock, or Hufton Point.\nLeemouth.\nHangman Hill.\nSt. Donat's Castle.\nLlantwit Church.\nLlangwynewar Hill, east part.\nA remarkable hill.\nLlanmace Church.\nSt. Hilary's Church.\n\nThe direct distances are the most accurate, the others being affected according to the exactness of the meridian of the west extremity of the base; the direction of which was found by the variation needle, its declination having been determined at Frampton-house, and therefore sufficiently correct; for an error in that angle, even of half a degree, would make a difference of a very few seconds in any of the places observed.\n\nThe following are the longitudes and latitudes of the same places, deduced by Gen.

The breadth of the Severn at that part where I took the angles is about 12½ miles. However coarse these trigonometrical operations may appear, when compared to those made so scientifically, and with such wonderful exactness, in the southern parts of the kingdom, they nevertheless settle the geographical situations of the given places with more precision than is usually obtained, even from a series of astronomical observations.\n\nPerhaps some gentlemen in the north of Devonshire or Somersetshire may be induced to continue similar operations, when they consider with what little trouble they may be made, as the distances between any of the towns I have determined may suffice for a base.",
