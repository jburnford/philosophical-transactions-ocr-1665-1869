With regard to the Extent of the late Earthquake this Way (I mean due East from London) I cannot learn that it pass'd the little River Rodden that runs by my Gardens, and crosses the Harwich Road at Great Ilford. My own House stands about half a Mile North from the 6 Mile-Stone. I was in my Gardens with several Workmen, and none of us were sensible of any thing; but my Wife, who was in her Dressing-room, felt the House tremble so much, that, upon my coming in, she told me she verily believ'd there had been an Earthquake; the Motion of the House under her being exactly like what she had often heard describ'd when she was in Italy.

I am,

SIR,

Your most obedient humble Servant,

Smart Lethieullier.

The President's Account of the Earthquake at London, March 8.

March 8, 1749.

At very nearly half an Hour after 3 this Morning, being then in Bed, but perfectly awake, I felt a very strong Shake, or rather 3 or 4 successive Shakes of an Earthquake, as I immediately took them to be. I judge the whole Phenomenon
Phenomenon to have lasted about 3 or at most 4 Seconds of Time; and the Shocks appear'd to differ from what I had felt on the 8th of last Month, in this Particular, that I did not now perceive that lifting upwards, and sudden settling again, which I was then sensible of; nor did I hear that distinct Noise, as of a great Weight falling, which most People were then surprized with: But what now most affected me was the Sensation of very quick Shakes, or of a Tremor, as it appear'd in a horizontal Direction; and I heard, during all the time, a sort of Crackling of the Wainscot, Window-Frames, and Floor, with such a Rattling in the Chimney, as I have sometimes heard upon a sudden and strong Gust of Wind.

I instantly jump'd out of Bed, to see if there was any Damage done; and going to my Chamber-Door, I met my Daughter running in a Fright from her Room, who said she was wak'd with such a Shock, that she thought her Room had been falling; two Men-Servants also, who lay in the Garret, and whom I had called to, answer'd me whilst I was talking to my Daughter, that they were both wakened by the Shock, and that they felt, as they both expressed it, such a Motion, as they had sometimes known given to a Child in a Cradle.

Presently after I had got on my Clothes, I spoke to some of my Neighbours, who all gave me very nearly the same Account as this I have been just giving of what I had observed myself; only some added, particularly a Gentleman who lives in an older House than mine, that he apprehended, from a crackling Noise over his Head, that a Chimney had been thrown
thrown down, and was then breaking thro' the Tiles and Lathing of his House.

I sent a Servant out about 7 o'Clock, and he met a Countryman, who was bringing a Load of Hay from beyond Highgate, and who was on the other Side of the Town when the Shock happen'd; he did not, he said, feel it, as he was driving his Waggon; but that the People he saw in the Town of Highgate were all greatly surprised, saying they had had their Houses very much shock'd, and that the Chairs in some were thrown about in their Rooms.

The Chamber I lie in is up two Pair of Stairs forwards, and my Bed stands North West and South-East. I took particular Notice, that there was neither Cart nor Coach going by, but that every thing was entirely quiet at the Time.

An Account of the same, by the Rev. Mr. Tho. Birch F. R. S.

Read March 8. 1749-50.

THIS Morning, Thursday March 8. 1749-50. about 18 Minutes before 6, according to equal Time, or half an Hour after 5 by the Sun, I felt, in my Bed-chamber, on the second Story of my House in Norfolk Street, adjoining to the River, a Shock of an Earthquake, much stronger, and of longer Duration, than that which I had felt on Thursday Feb. 8. I was full awake, and had just begun to dress myself, when I was alarm'd with the trembling of the Room, attended with
