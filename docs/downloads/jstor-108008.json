By James Ivory, K.H., M.A., F.R.S., Instit. Reg. Sc. Paris. Corresp. et Reg. Sc. Gottin. Corresp.\n\nReceived May 30,—Read June 20, 1833.\n\nThe perturbations of the planets caused by their mutual attraction depend chiefly upon one algebraic expression, from the development of which all the inequalities of their motions are derived. This function is very complicated, and requires much labour and many tedious operations to expand it in a series of parts which can be separately computed according to the occasions of the astronomer. The progress of physical astronomy has undoubtedly been retarded by the excessive length and irksomeness attending the arithmetical calculation of the inequalities. On this subject astronomers generally and continually complain; and that their complaints are well founded, is very aptly illustrated by a paper contained in the last year's Transactions of this Society.\n\nThe disturbing function is usually expanded in parts arranged according to the powers and products of the excentricities and the inclinations of the orbits to the ecliptic; and, as these elements are always small, the resulting series decreases in every case with great rapidity. No difficulty would therefore be found in this research, if an inequality depended solely on the quantity of the coefficient of its argument in the expanded function; because the terms of the series decrease so fast, that all of them, except those of the first order, or, at most, those of the first and second orders, might be safely neglected, as producing no sensible variation in the planet's motion. But the magnitude of an inequality depends upon the length of its period, as well as upon the coefficient of its argument. When the former embraces a course of many years, the latter, although almost evanescent in the differential equation, acquires a great multiplier in the process of integration, and thus comes to have a sensible effect on the place of the planet. Such is the origin of some of the most remarkable\nof the planetary irregularities, and in particular, of the great equations in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn, the discovery of which does so much honour to the sagacity of Laplace. It is not, therefore, enough to calculate the terms of the first order, or of the first and second orders, in the expansion of the disturbing function. This is already done in most of the books that treat of physical astronomy with all the care and fulness which the importance of the subject demands, leaving little room for further improvement. In the present state of the theory of the planetary motions, it is requisite that the astronomer have it in his power to compute any term in the expansion of the disturbing function below the sixth order; since it has been found that there are inequalities depending upon terms of the fifth order, which have a sensible effect on the motions of some of the planets.\n\nA research that has for its object the lessening of the difficulty attending the expansion of the disturbing function, and the bringing of that expression more under the power of the astronomer, is one of considerable interest, and of some moment to the progress of physical astronomy. But the question is not to exhibit separately every individual argument with its coefficient, which would be of little utility in practice, since, although their number be infinite, very few of them are of any account in computing the place of a planet. The end to be aimed at, is to give the function such a form that the astronomer may have it in his power to select any inequality he may wish to examine, and to compute the coefficient of its argument by an arithmetical process of moderate length. The present Paper is an attempt of this kind. The investigation comprehends every argument not passing the fifth order; but, as the formulas are regular, the method may be extended indefinitely to any order.\n\n1. Let $x, y, z$, represent the rectangular coordinates of the disturbed planet, $z$ being perpendicular to a fixed plane passing through the sun's centre, at which point the origin of the coordinates is placed: in like manner let $x', y', z'$ be the coordinates of the disturbing planet; and put $m'$ for the proportion of the mass of this planet to the sum of the masses of the sun and the disturbed planet; then, $R$ denoting the disturbing function, we shall have,\n\n$$R = m' \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(x' - x)^2 + (y' - y)^2 + (z' - z)^2}} - \\frac{x'x + y'y + z'z}{(x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\right\\}.$$  \n\nIf $r$ and $r'$ denote the distances of the disturbed and disturbing planets from\nthe sun's centre; \\( \\omega \\), their angular distance seen at the same point; and \\( \\varepsilon \\), their rectilinear distance from one another, then,\n\n\\[\n\\varepsilon = \\sqrt{r^2 - 2rr'\\cos \\omega + r'^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R}{m'} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{r\\cos \\omega}{r'^2}.\n\\]\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the function to be expanded consists of two parts, of which \\( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\), the reciprocal of the distance of the two planets, is common to the disturbing functions of both; but this is not the case with the other part, in which \\( r \\) and \\( r' \\) do not enter alike. For this reason it will contribute to distinctness to expand the two parts separately. But, previously, it is necessary to express \\( \\cos \\omega \\) in terms of the angular motions of the planets in their respective orbits.\n\nIf \\( \\nu \\) represent the angular distance of the disturbed planet in its orbit from a fixed origin, and \\( P \\) the place of the node, that is, of the intersection of the orbit with the immovable plane of \\( xy \\), \\( P \\) being reckoned in the same plane and from the same origin as \\( \\nu \\), then \\( \\nu - P \\) will be the angular distance of the planet from the node. Further, if \\( A \\) be the celestial arc between the node and the intersection of the orbits of the two planets, the distance of the planet from the same intersection will be equal to\n\n\\[\n\\nu - P - A.\n\\]\n\nIf the foregoing symbols be accented and transferred with like significations to the disturbing planet, the celestial arc between that planet and the intersection of the orbits will be equal to\n\n\\[\n\\nu' - P' - A'.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( \\nu - P - A \\) and \\( \\nu' - P' - A' \\) are two sides of a triangle of which the arc \\( \\omega \\) is the third side; wherefore if \\( I \\) be the inclination of the two orbits, we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\omega = \\cos (\\nu - P - A) \\cos (\\nu' - P' - A') \\\\\n+ \\cos I \\sin (\\nu - P - A) \\sin (\\nu' - P' - A'),\n\\]\n\nor, which is the same thing,\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\omega = \\cos^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\nu - \\nu' - P + P' - A + A') \\\\\n+ \\sin^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\nu + \\nu' - P - P' - A - A').\n\\]\nLet $N$ be the place of the node of the disturbed planet reckoned in the immoveable plane of $x y$, and $i$ the inclination of the orbit to the same plane: then, if $\\nu$ represent the longitude of the intersection of the orbits of the two planets, $A$ will be the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which $i$ is one angle, and $\\nu - N$ the side adjacent to $i$; wherefore\n\n$$\\tan A = \\frac{\\tan (\\nu - N)}{\\cos i};$$\n\nand, by the usual methods,\n\n$$A = \\nu - N + \\tan^2 \\frac{i}{2} \\sin 2(\\nu - N) + \\frac{1}{2} \\tan^2 \\frac{i}{2} \\sin 4(\\nu - N), \\text{&c.};$$\n\nand if we put\n\n$$\\xi = \\tan^2 \\frac{i}{2} \\sin 2(\\nu - N) + \\frac{1}{2} \\tan^2 \\frac{i}{2} \\sin 4(\\nu - N), \\text{&c.},$$\n\nwe shall have\n\n$$P + A = \\nu + P - N + \\xi.$$\n\nLet $[P - N]$ be the value of $P - N$ at some given epoch: then the differentials of $N$ and $P$ being $dN$ and $\\cos i \\cdot dN$, we shall have generally,\n\n$$P - N = [P - N] - \\int dN + \\int \\cos i \\cdot dN = [P - N] - 2 \\int \\sin^2 \\frac{i}{2} dN,$$\n\nthe integral being taken for the time elapsed from the epoch. It thus appears that $P - N$ may be considered as an invariable arc, or as one subject to an almost insensible secular equation. In order to abridge expressions, let us now put\n\n$$\\alpha = [P - N] - 2 \\int \\sin^2 \\frac{i}{2} dN + \\xi;$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\\nu - P - A = \\nu - \\alpha - \\nu.$$\n\nIf the symbols which stand for the elements of the disturbed planet be assumed, when accented, to represent the like elements of the disturbing planet, we shall have similarly,\n\n$$\\alpha' = [P' - N'] - 2 \\int \\sin^2 \\frac{i'}{2} dN' + \\xi',$$\n\n$$\\nu' - P' - A' = \\nu' - \\alpha' - \\nu.$$\nThe value of $\\cos \\omega$ will now be thus expressed,\n\n$$\\cos \\omega = \\cos^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\nu - \\nu' - \\alpha + \\alpha')$$\n\n$$+ \\sin^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\nu + \\nu' - \\alpha - \\alpha' - 2\\nu).$$\n\nIt remains to determine $I$, the inclination of the orbits, and $\\nu$, the longitude of their intersection. Now $I$ is the vertical angle of a triangle of which $N - N'$ is the base, and $i$ and $i'$ the adjacent angles, one being interior and the other exterior to the triangle: wherefore\n\n$$\\cos I = \\cos i \\cos i' + \\sin i \\sin i' \\cos (N - N').$$\n\nIn the same triangle, a perpendicular being let fall upon the base from the vertical angle, $\\nu - N$ and $\\nu - N'$ are the arcs between the perpendicular and the extremities of the base; and hence,\n\n$$\\cot \\left(\\nu - \\frac{N + N'}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin (i - i')}{\\sin (i + i')} \\cdot \\cot \\frac{N - N'}{2}.$$ \n\nIn the method here followed, the expression of $\\cos \\omega$ is as simple and as little troublesome in calculation, as it would be if one of the orbits were adopted for the immovable plane.\n\n2. Let $\\zeta$, $\\varepsilon$, $e$, $\\varpi$ represent the mean motion, the epoch, the eccentricity, and the place of the perihelion, of the disturbed planet at the time for which we are computing: if this time be near the epoch for which the elements have been assigned, the values at the epoch may be taken as the true values; and if a great interval has elapsed, the values at the epoch may be corrected by their secular equations. Further, put $\\mu$ for the mean anomaly, $\\sigma$ for the equation of the centre, $a$ for the mean distance, and $a(1-s)$ for the radius vector: then,\n\n$$\\nu = \\zeta + \\varepsilon + \\sigma,$$\n\n$$\\mu = \\zeta + \\varepsilon - \\varpi,$$\n\n$$\\gamma = a(1-s),$$\n\nAnd the values of $\\sigma$ and $s$, found by the solution of Kepler's problem, are expressed by the usual series, viz.\n\\[ \\sigma = e \\cdot 2 \\sin \\mu + e^2 \\cdot \\frac{5 \\sin 2 \\mu}{4} + e^3 \\cdot \\frac{13 \\sin 3 \\mu - 3 \\sin \\mu}{12} + e^4 \\cdot \\frac{103 \\sin 4 \\mu - 44 \\sin 2 \\mu}{96} + e^5 \\cdot \\frac{1097 \\sin 5 \\mu - 645 \\sin 3 \\mu + 50 \\sin \\mu}{960} \\]\n\n\\[ s = e \\cos \\mu + e^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\cos 2 \\mu - 1}{2} + e^3 \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cos 3 \\mu - 3 \\cos \\mu}{8} + e^4 \\cdot \\frac{\\cos 4 \\mu - \\cos 2 \\mu}{3} + e^5 \\cdot \\frac{125 \\cos 5 \\mu - 135 \\cos 3 \\mu + 10 \\cos \\mu}{384}. \\]\n\nUsing always the same symbols which stand for the elements of the disturbed planet, when accented, to represent the like elements of the disturbing planet, and introducing the new characters \\( \\varphi \\) and \\( \\varphi' \\) in order to shorten expressions, we shall have,\n\n\\[ v - \\alpha = \\zeta + \\varepsilon - \\alpha + \\sigma = \\varphi + \\sigma \\]\n\\[ v' - \\alpha' = \\zeta' + \\varepsilon' - \\alpha' + \\sigma' = \\varphi' + \\sigma'. \\]\n\nIf these values, as well the values of \\( r \\) and \\( r' \\), be substituted in that part of the disturbing function which is more easily dealt with, we shall obtain,\n\n\\[ \\frac{r \\cos \\omega}{r'^2} = \\frac{a}{a'^2} \\left\\{ \\cos^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\varphi - \\varphi' + \\sigma - \\sigma') \\cdot \\frac{1 - s}{(1 - s')^2} + \\sin^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\varphi + \\varphi' + \\sigma + \\sigma' - 2 \\nu) \\cdot \\frac{1 - s}{(1 - s')^2} \\right\\}; \\]\n\nor,\n\n\\[ \\frac{r \\cos \\omega}{r'^2} = \\frac{a}{a'^2} \\left\\{ \\cos^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\varphi - \\varphi') \\cdot \\frac{(1 - s) \\cos (\\sigma - \\sigma')}{(1 - s')^2} - \\cos^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\sin (\\varphi - \\varphi') \\cdot \\frac{(1 - s) \\sin (\\sigma - \\sigma')}{(1 - s')^2} + \\sin^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\varphi + \\varphi' - 2 \\nu) \\cdot \\frac{(1 - s) \\cos (\\sigma + \\sigma')}{(1 - s')^2} - \\sin^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\cdot \\cos (\\varphi + \\varphi' - 2 \\nu) \\cdot \\frac{(1 - s) \\sin (\\sigma + \\sigma')}{(1 - s')^2} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nThe inspecting of this formula is sufficient to show that the expansion of the part multiplied by \\( \\sin^2 \\frac{1}{2} I \\) is deducible without calculation from the expansion of the other part. For, as \\( \\sigma' \\) is a series of the sines, and \\( s' \\) a series of the cosines, of the multiples of \\( \\mu' \\), the former will change its sign with \\( \\mu' \\), while the latter\nwill not vary: wherefore the expansion of the part multiplied by $\\sin^2 \\frac{1}{2}$ I will be obtained from the expansion of the other part, merely by making $\\mu'$ negative, and writing $\\phi + \\phi' - 2\\nu$ in place of $\\phi - \\phi'$ in all the arguments.\n\nWe have therefore only to expand the two first lines of the expression, for which purpose they may be thus written:\n\n$$\\cos (\\phi - \\phi') \\cdot \\left\\{ (1 - s) \\cos \\sigma \\times \\frac{\\cos \\sigma'}{(1 - s')^3} + (1 - s) \\sin \\sigma + \\frac{\\sin \\sigma'}{(1 - s')^3} \\right\\}$$\n\n$$+ \\sin (\\phi - \\phi') \\cdot \\left\\{ -(1 - s) \\sin \\sigma \\times \\frac{\\cos \\sigma'}{(1 - s')^3} + (1 - s) \\cos \\sigma \\times \\frac{\\sin \\sigma'}{(1 - s')^3} \\right\\}$$\n\nNeglecting quantities above the fifth order with respect to the excentricities, we have,\n\n$$(1 - s) \\cos \\sigma = 1 - s - \\frac{s^2}{2} + \\frac{s^4}{24} - \\frac{s^6}{24},$$\n\n$$(1 - s) \\sin \\sigma = \\sigma - s \\sigma - \\frac{s^3}{6} + \\frac{s^5}{6} + \\frac{s^7}{120};$$\n\nAnd, if we assume,\n\n$$(1 - s) \\cos \\sigma = A^{(0)} + A^{(1)} e \\cos \\mu + A^{(2)} e^2 \\cos 2\\mu \\ldots + A^{(5)} e^5 \\cos 5\\mu,$$\n\n$$(1 - s) \\sin \\sigma = B^{(1)} e \\sin \\mu + B^{(2)} e^2 \\sin 2\\mu \\ldots B^{(5)} e^5 \\sin 5\\mu;$$\n\nwe shall readily find,\n\n$$A^{(0)} = 1 - \\frac{e^2}{2} - \\frac{e^4}{64} \\quad B^{(1)} = 2 - \\frac{3}{8} e^2 + \\frac{5}{96} e^4$$\n\n$$A^{(1)} = -1 - \\frac{3}{8} e^2 + \\frac{5}{96} e^4 \\quad B^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{5}{12} e^2$$\n\n$$A^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{e^2}{3} \\quad B^{(3)} = \\frac{7}{24} - \\frac{41}{96} e^2$$\n\n$$A^{(3)} = \\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{13}{32} e^2 \\quad B^{(4)} = \\frac{29}{64}$$\n\n$$A^{(4)} = \\frac{67}{129} \\quad B^{(5)} = \\frac{77}{240}.$$\nAnd, by proceeding similarly,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos \\sigma'}{(1 - s')^2} = a^{(0)} + a^{(1)} e' \\cos \\mu' + a^{(2)} e'^2 \\cos 2 \\mu' + \\ldots + a^{(5)} e'^5 \\cos 5 \\mu'\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin \\sigma'}{(1 - s')^2} = b^{(1)} e' \\sin \\mu' + b^{(2)} e'^2 \\sin 2 \\mu' + \\ldots + b^{(5)} e'^5 \\sin 5 \\mu'\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^{(0)} = 1 - \\frac{e'^2}{2} - \\frac{e'^4}{24}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^{(1)} = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} e'^2 + \\frac{5}{24} e'^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^{(1)} = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} e'^2 + \\frac{5}{24} e'^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^{(2)} = \\frac{13}{4} - \\frac{41}{12} e'^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^{(2)} = \\frac{7}{2} - \\frac{10}{3} e'^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^{(3)} = \\frac{31}{6} - \\frac{161}{24} e'^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^{(3)} = \\frac{11}{2} - \\frac{53}{8} e'^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^{(4)} = \\frac{761}{96}\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^{(4)} = \\frac{1603}{192}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^{(5)} = \\frac{2827}{240}\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^{(5)} = \\frac{149}{12}\n\\]\n\nWe can now assign any term of the expansion we are considering.

Supposing that \\( a' \\) is greater than \\( a \\), and that \\( n \\) represents any odd number, we have,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f^{n-1}}{D_0^n} = \\left(1 - \\frac{a^2}{a'^2}\\right)^{\\frac{n-1}{2}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\left\\{1 + \\frac{a^2}{a'^2} - 2 \\frac{a}{a'} \\cos \\psi\\right\\}^{\\frac{n}{2}}}.\n\\]\n\nWherefore, assuming as usual,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\left\\{1 + \\frac{a^2}{a'^2} - 2 \\frac{a}{a'} \\cos \\psi\\right\\}^{\\frac{n}{2}}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_n^0 + C_n^{(1)} \\cos \\psi + C_n^{(2)} \\cos 2\\psi \\ldots + C_n^{(k)} \\cos k\\psi \\ldots,\n\\]\n\nthe part of \\( \\frac{1}{D_0} \\), and of its second and fourth differentials, which are multiplied by \\( \\cos k\\psi \\), will be respectively,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos k\\psi}{a'} \\times C_1^{(k)}, \\quad \\frac{\\cos k\\psi}{a'} \\times -k^2 C_1^{(k)}, \\quad \\frac{\\cos k\\psi}{a'} \\times k^4 C_1^{(k)};\n\\]\n\nand the like parts of \\( \\frac{f}{D_0^3} \\) and its differentials, will be,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - \\frac{a^2}{a'^2}}{a'} \\times C_3^{(k)} \\cos k\\psi, \\quad \\frac{1 - \\frac{a^2}{a'^2}}{a'} \\times -k^2 C_3^{(k)} \\cos k\\psi, \\quad \\frac{1 - \\frac{a^2}{a'^2}}{a'} \\times k^4 C_3^{(k)} \\cos k\\psi.\n\\]\nIt remains then to substitute these values in $B^{(0)}$, $B^{(1)}$, &c., in place of $\\frac{1}{D_0}$, $\\frac{f}{D_0^3}$, and their differentials: but, in order to obtain the formulas most convenient for calculation, it will be requisite to express the coefficient of the development of $\\frac{f}{D_0^3}$ by means of those of the development of $\\frac{1}{D_0}$.\n\nIf we write $\\alpha$ for $\\frac{a}{\\alpha}$, and put\n\n$$V = \\sqrt{1 + \\alpha^2 - 2 \\alpha \\cos \\psi},$$\n\nwe have this formula,\n\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\psi} \\frac{1}{V} = -\\frac{\\alpha \\sin \\psi}{V^3};$$\n\nand if we substitute the expansions of $\\frac{1}{V}$ and $\\frac{1}{V^3}$, and equate the coefficients of $\\sin k \\psi$, the result will be\n\n$$2kC_1^{(k)} = \\alpha C_3^{(k-1)} - \\alpha C_3^{(k-1)}.$$\n\nWe have likewise this identical expression,\n\n$$\\frac{1}{V} = \\frac{V^3}{V^3} = \\frac{1 + \\alpha^2}{V^3} - \\frac{2 \\alpha \\cos \\psi}{V^3};$$\n\nand by substituting the expansions of $\\frac{1}{V}$ and $\\frac{1}{V^3}$, and equating the coefficients of $\\cos k \\psi$, we get\n\n$$C_1^{(k)} = (1 + \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k)} - \\alpha C_3^{(k-1)} - \\alpha C_3^{(k+1)}.$$\n\nBy combining the two formulas, we deduce\n\n$$2\\alpha C_3^{(k+1)} = (1 + \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k)} - (2k + 1) C_1^{(k)}$$\n\n$$2\\alpha C_3^{(k-1)} = (1 + \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k)} - (2k - 1) C_1^{(k)}.$$\n\nChange $k$ for $k - 1$ in the first of these formulas, and for $k + 1$ in the second, and the two following formulas will be obtained,\n\n$$2\\alpha C_3^{(k)} = (1 + \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k-1)} - (2k - 1) C_1^{(k-1)}$$\n\n$$2\\alpha C_3^{(k)} = (1 + \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k+1)} + (2k + 1) C_1^{(k+1)}.$$\n\nBy combining the four last formulas in different ways, different values of $C_3^{(k)}$ will be found, which may be used at pleasure, viz.\n\\[(1 - \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k)} = (2k + 1) \\left\\{ \\frac{1 + \\alpha^2}{1 - \\alpha^2} C_1^{(k)} - \\frac{2\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha^2} C_1^{(k+1)} \\right\\}\\]\n\n\\[(1 - \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k)} = (2k - 1) \\left\\{ \\frac{2\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha^2} C_1^{(k-1)} - \\frac{1 + \\alpha^2}{1 - \\alpha^2} C_1^{(k)} \\right\\}\\]\n\n\\[(1 - \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k)} = \\frac{4k^3 - 1}{4k} \\cdot \\frac{2\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha^2} \\cdot \\left( C_1^{k-1} - C_1^{k+1} \\right).\\]\n\nIn order to shorten expressions, and to bring the formulas to a form convenient for calculation, let\n\n\\[\\alpha = \\tan \\frac{1}{2} \\theta;\\]\n\nthen,\n\n\\[\\frac{1 + \\alpha^2}{1 - \\alpha^2} = h = \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} \\cdot \\frac{2\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha^2} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = h \\sin \\theta;\\]\n\nfurther, assume the new symbol \\(a^{(k)}\\), the value of which may be calculated by any one of these formulas, viz.\n\n\\[a^{(k)} = (2k + 1) \\left( C_1^k - \\sin \\theta C_1^{(k+1)} \\right),\\]\n\n\\[a^{(k)} = (2k - 1) \\left( \\sin \\theta C_1^{(k-1)} - C_1^{(k)} \\right),\\]\n\n\\[a^{(k)} = \\frac{4k^3 - 1}{4k} \\cdot \\sin \\theta \\left( C_1^{k-1} - C_1^{k+1} \\right);\\]\n\nthen,\n\n\\[(1 - \\alpha^2) C_3^{(k)} = h \\cdot a^{(k)}.\\]\n\nUsing this value, the parts of \\(\\frac{f}{D_0^3}\\) and its differentials, multiplied by \\(\\cos k \\psi\\) will be\n\n\\[\\frac{\\cos k \\psi}{a'} \\times h a^{(k)}, \\frac{\\cos k \\psi}{a'} \\times -h k^2 a^{(k)}, \\frac{\\cos k \\psi}{a'} \\times h k^4 a^{(k)}.\\]\n\nThese, as well as the like parts of \\(\\frac{1}{D_0}\\) and its differentials, must be substituted in \\(B^{(0)}, B^{(1)}, \\&c.\\).

Although all the coefficients are supposed to be deduced from six of them, for which alone direct expressions are given, it is nevertheless obvious that an independent formula may be found by which any proposed coefficient may be separately computed: namely, by substituting the values of $b_0^{(k)}, b_1^{(k)}, \\&c.$, in the expressions of the several finite differences.\n\nAlthough there can be no difficulty in applying the formulas, it may not be improper, for the sake of illustration, to take an example. We shall choose the instance of\n\n**Venus and the Earth.**\n\nIn this case $a'$ will represent the mean distance of the Earth, and $a$ that of Venus: wherefore,\n\n$$\\frac{a}{a'} = \\alpha = 0.7323332 = \\tan \\frac{1}{2} \\theta, \\quad \\theta = 71^\\circ 45' 32'',$$\n\n$$h = \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} = 3.1947202, \\quad \\log \\sin \\theta = 9.9776083.$$  \n\nThe method likewise requires that there be previously calculated a sufficient number of the first coefficients in the expansion,\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + x^2 - 2x \\cos \\psi}} = \\frac{1}{2} C^{(0)} + C^{(1)} \\cos \\psi + C^{(2)} \\cos 2 \\psi \\ldots C^{(k)} \\cos k \\psi \\ldots,$$\n\nwhich is accomplished by rules amply detailed in all the treatises on Physical Astronomy. We next deduce the value of $a^{(k)}$, viz.\n\n$$a^{(k)} = (2k + 1) \\cdot (C^{(k)} - \\sin \\theta C^{(k+1)}):$$\nand, with the numbers thus found, we have generally for any proposed value of $k$,\n\n$$b_0^{(k)} = C^{(k)},$$\n\n$$b_1^{(k)} = \\frac{1}{2} C^{(k)} + 1.59736 \\cdot a^{(k)}$$\n\n$$b_2^{(k)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{k^2}{2}\\right) \\cdot C^{(k)} + 4.148919 \\cdot a^{(k)}$$\n\n$$b_3^{(k)} = \\{-0.008113 + 1.282453 \\cdot k^2\\} \\cdot C^{(k)}$$\n\n$$+ \\{10.459698 + 0.266227 \\cdot k^2\\} \\cdot a^{(k)}$$\n\n$$b_4^{(k)} = \\left\\{-0.512255 + 3.132352 \\cdot k^2 + \\frac{k^4}{24}\\right\\} \\cdot C^{(k)}$$\n\n$$+ \\{28.09035 + 0.957713 \\cdot k^2\\} \\cdot a^{(k)}$$\n\n$$b_5^{(k)} = \\{-1.861383 + 8.390554 \\cdot k^2 + 0.157412 \\cdot k^4\\} \\cdot C^{(k)}$$\n\n$$+ \\{80.06813 + 2.719660 \\cdot k^2 + 0.0133113 \\cdot k^4\\} \\cdot a^{(k)}$$\n\nNothing can be more easy than the computation of these six quantities for any assigned value of $k$.

None of these serieses, when carried to quantities of the fifth order inclusively, and arranged according to the sines and cosines of the multiples of the mean anomaly, con-\ntain more than six terms, and they thus afford a ready way of calculating the part of\n\n\\[ s^i s^j \\cos k (\\phi - \\phi' + \\sigma - \\sigma') \\]\n\nof any proposed order with respect to \\( e \\) and \\( e' \\).\n\nThese serieses are as follow:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos k \\sigma &= \\left(1 - \\frac{k^2}{64} k^2 e^4 + \\frac{k^4 e^8}{4}\\right) \\\\\n&- \\left(\\frac{5}{4} k^2 e^2 + \\frac{1}{16} k^2 e^4 - \\frac{5}{12} k^4 e^4\\right) \\cdot e \\cos \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(k^2 - \\frac{4}{3} k^2 e^2 - \\frac{k^4 e^2}{3}\\right) \\cdot e^2 \\cos 2 \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{5}{4} k^2 - \\frac{27}{16} k^4 e^2 - \\frac{5}{8} k^4 e^2\\right) \\cdot e^3 \\cos 3 \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{k^4}{12} + \\frac{283}{192} k^2\\right) \\cdot e^4 \\cos 4 \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{5}{24} k^4 + \\frac{7}{4} k^2\\right) \\cdot e^5 \\cos 5 \\mu.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin k \\sigma &= \\left(2 k - \\frac{k e^2}{4} + \\frac{5 k e^4}{96} - k^3 e^2 + \\frac{13 k^3 e^4}{96} + \\frac{k^5 e^5}{6}\\right) \\cdot e \\sin \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{5 k}{4} - \\frac{11 k e^2}{24} - \\frac{5 k^3 e^3}{4}\\right) \\cdot e^2 \\sin 2 \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{13 k}{24} - \\frac{43}{64} k e^2 - \\frac{k^3}{3} - \\frac{307 k^3 e^3}{192} - \\frac{k^4 e^4}{12}\\right) \\cdot e^3 \\sin 3 \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{103}{96} k + \\frac{5}{8} k^3\\right) \\cdot e^4 \\sin 4 \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{1097}{960} k + \\frac{179}{192} k^3 + \\frac{k^5}{60}\\right) \\cdot e^5 \\sin 5 \\mu.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ns \\cos k \\sigma &= -\\frac{e^2}{2} + \\frac{k^2 e^4}{8} \\\\\n&+ \\left(1 - \\frac{3 e^2}{8} + \\frac{5 e^4}{192} - \\frac{k^2 e^2}{2} + \\frac{37 k^3 e^4}{96} + \\frac{k^4 e^4}{12}\\right) \\cdot e \\cos \\mu \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{e^2}{3} - k^2 e^2\\right) \\cdot e^2 \\cos 2 \\mu.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\\[\ns \\sin k \\sigma = -k \\left( \\frac{7}{8} e^2 - \\frac{3}{32} e^4 - \\frac{5k^2 e^8}{24} \\right) \\cdot e \\sin \\mu \\\\\n+ k \\left( 1 - \\frac{23}{24} e^2 - \\frac{k^2 e^8}{3} \\right) \\cdot e^2 \\sin 2 \\mu \\\\\n+ k \\left( \\frac{9}{8} - \\frac{115}{96} e^2 - \\frac{35k^2 e^8}{48} \\right) \\cdot e^3 \\sin 3 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{50}{48} k + \\frac{k^3}{6} \\right) \\cdot e^4 \\sin 4 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{11}{8} k + \\frac{19}{48} k^3 \\right) \\cdot e^5 \\sin 5 \\mu\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^2 \\cos k \\sigma = \\frac{e^2}{2} - \\frac{k^2 e^4}{4} \\\\\n- \\left( \\frac{e^2}{2} - \\frac{e^4}{24} + \\frac{k^2 e^4}{8} \\right) \\cdot e \\cos \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{e^2}{2} \\right) \\cdot e^2 \\cos 2 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{9e^2}{16} - \\frac{7k^2 e^2}{16} \\right) \\cdot e^3 \\cos 3 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{k^2}{4} \\right) \\cdot e^4 \\cos 4 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{25}{48} + \\frac{9k^2}{16} \\right) \\cdot e^5 \\cos 5 \\mu\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^2 \\sin k \\sigma = \\left( \\frac{ke^2}{2} + \\frac{ke^4}{12} - \\frac{k^2 e^4}{12} \\right) \\cdot e \\sin \\mu \\\\\n- \\frac{3k e^2}{8} \\cdot e^2 \\sin 2 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{k}{2} - \\frac{5k e^2}{6} - \\frac{k^3 e^2}{12} \\right) \\cdot e^3 \\sin 3 \\mu\n\\]\n\\[\ns^3 \\cos k \\sigma = - \\frac{3}{8} e^4 + \\left( \\frac{3}{4} e^2 - \\frac{3 e^4}{16} + k^2 e^4 \\right) \\cdot e \\cos \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{9 e^2}{32} + \\frac{k^2 e^2}{8} \\right) \\cdot e^3 \\cos 3 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot e^4 \\cos 4 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\left( \\frac{15}{32} + \\frac{k^3}{8} \\right) \\cdot e^5 \\cos 5 \\mu\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^3 \\sin k \\sigma = - \\frac{7 k e^4}{16} \\cdot e \\sin \\mu + \\frac{k e^2}{2} \\cdot e^2 \\sin 2 \\mu + \\frac{3 k e^2}{32} \\cdot e^3 \\sin 3 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot e^4 \\sin 4 \\mu + \\frac{17 k}{32} \\cdot e^5 \\sin 5 \\mu\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^4 \\cos k \\sigma = \\frac{3}{8} e^4 - \\frac{e^4}{2} \\cdot e \\cos \\mu + \\frac{e^2}{2} \\cdot e^2 \\cos 2 \\mu + \\frac{e^2}{4} \\cdot e^3 \\cos 3 \\mu \\\\\n+ \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot e^4 \\cos 4 \\mu + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot e^5 \\cos 5 \\mu\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^4 \\sin k \\sigma = \\frac{k e^4}{4} \\cdot e \\sin \\mu + \\frac{3 k e^2}{8} \\cdot e^3 \\sin 3 \\mu + \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot e^5 \\sin 5 \\mu\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^5 \\cos k \\sigma = \\frac{5 e^4}{8} \\cdot e \\cos \\mu + \\frac{5 e^2}{16} \\cdot e^3 \\cos 3 \\mu + \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot e^5 \\cos 5 \\mu\n\\]\n\nThe use of these serieses is obvious.

One part of the disturbing function yet remains to be considered.\n\n**Expansion of** \\(\\sin^4 \\frac{1}{2} I \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{r^2 r'^2}{D^5} \\times q^2.\\)\n\nIn the expression of \\(\\frac{r r'}{D^3}\\) found in §7, leave out quantities of the second and third order with respect to \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\), and we shall have,\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{r r'}{D^3} = \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} B^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{2} B^{(1)} \\cdot e' \\cos \\mu' - \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta B^{(0)} \\cdot e \\cos \\mu.\\]\n\nNow let\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{d B^{(0)}}{d (\\cos \\psi)} = \\frac{a a'}{f} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{f^2}{D_0^5} = \\frac{a a'}{f} \\times B^{(0)};\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{d B^{(1)}}{d (\\cos \\psi)} = \\frac{a a'}{f} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{f^2}{D_0^5} + \\frac{15}{4} \\cdot \\frac{f^3}{D_0^7} \\right) = \\frac{a a'}{f} \\times B^{(1)};\\]\n\nand differentiate the formula for \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{r r'}{D^3}\\) relatively to the variable \\(\\cos \\psi\\), intro-\nducing the new symbols, and observing that \\( \\frac{a'f}{\\tan^2 \\theta} = \\frac{\\tan \\theta}{2} \\), the result will be,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r^3 r'^2}{D^5} = \\frac{\\tan^2 \\theta}{4} \\times \\left\\{ B''^{(0)} + B''^{(1)} e' \\cos \\mu' \\right\\}\n\\]\n\n\\[- \\Delta B''^0 e \\cos \\mu.\\]\n\nThe quantities \\( B''^{(0)} \\) and \\( B''^{(1)} \\), when expressed as before in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{D_0} \\) and \\( \\frac{f}{D_0^3} \\) and their differentials, will be as follow:\n\n\\[\nB''^{(0)} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{f^2}{D_0^5} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{D_0} - 2 \\frac{d}{d \\psi^2} \\frac{1}{D_0} + 2 h \\cdot \\frac{f}{D_0^3},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nB''^{(1)} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{f^2}{D_0^5} + \\frac{15}{4} \\cdot \\frac{f^3}{D_0^7} =\n\\]\n\n\\[- (8 h + 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{D_0} + \\frac{d}{d \\psi^2} \\frac{1}{D_0} \\right) - (8 h^2 + h - \\frac{9}{4}) \\cdot \\frac{f}{D_0^3} - \\frac{d}{d \\psi^2} \\frac{f}{D_0^3}.\n\\]\n\nProceeding as before, let\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos k \\psi}{a'} \\times b''^{(k)}_0, \\text{ and } \\frac{\\cos k \\psi}{a'} \\times b''^{(k)}_2,\n\\]\n\nrepresent the expressions into which\n\n\\( B''^{(0)} \\) and \\( B''^{(1)} \\)\n\nare changed, when we substitute, instead of \\( \\frac{1}{D_0} \\) and \\( \\frac{f}{D_0^3} \\) and their differentials, the parts of these quantities multiplied by \\( \\cos k \\psi \\): then the part multiplied by \\( \\cos k \\psi \\) in the expansion of \\( \\sin^4 \\frac{1}{2} I \\times \\frac{r^2 r'}{D^5} \\times q^2 \\), will be thus expressed:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin^4 \\frac{1}{2} I \\times \\cos k (\\phi - \\phi' + \\sigma - \\sigma') \\times q^2}{a'} \\times\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\theta \\times \\left\\{ b''^{(k)}_0 + b''^{(k)}_1 e \\cos \\mu' \\right\\}\n\\]\n\n\\[- \\Delta b''^{(k)}_0 e \\cos \\mu;\n\\]\n\nand the values of \\( b''^{(k)}_0 \\) and \\( b''^{(k)}_1 \\) will be as follow:\n\n\\[\nb''^{(k)}_0 = \\frac{4 k^2 - 1}{2} C^{(k)} + 2 h^2 \\cdot a^{(k)},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb''^{(k)}_1 = (8 h + 1) \\frac{4 k^2 - 1}{4} \\cdot C^{(k)} + \\left\\{ 8 h^3 + h^2 - \\frac{9}{4} h + h k^2 \\right\\} \\cdot a^{(k)}.\n\\]\nThe coefficients for any proposed value of $k$ may now be readily computed; and nothing is wanting in this part of the problem but to reduce the factor,\n\n$$\\cos k (\\phi - \\phi' + \\sigma - \\sigma'). \\left\\{ \\cos (\\phi - \\phi + \\sigma - \\sigma') - \\cos (\\phi + \\phi + \\sigma + \\sigma' - 2\\nu) \\right\\}^2,$$\n\nto the form,\n\n$$M + M' \\times e \\sin \\mu + M'' \\times e' \\sin \\mu',$$\n\nand then to multiply by it, retaining in the product only quantities of the first order relative to $e$ and $e'$. Now in this there is no difficulty: but the complete development of the expression would be bulky, and would contain many arguments, the greater part of which are insignificant and useless, although some of them deserve attention in particular researches. Leaving astronomers to select from the general expression the arguments which may suit their purpose, we shall here close what we had to offer respecting the development of the disturbing function, without adding to the length of this paper by any application of what we have written.\n\nMay 30, 1833.",
