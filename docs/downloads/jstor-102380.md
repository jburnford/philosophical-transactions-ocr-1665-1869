V. Extract of a Letter from Mr. de Vallemont, &c., concerning a small Egg being found within an ordinary one, taken from the Journal des Savans of the 7th of Jan. 1696.

In the Journal des Savans of the 7th of Jan. 1696, there is an account of a small Egg of about 7 Lines from end to end, and 4½ of bigness, which was included in a Hens Egg, which appeared to have nothing extraordinary on its outside, and which they were breaking to make an Omelette of. The small Egg-shell was fastened to the shell of the greater by one of its Extremities.

Several Instances of the like nature are extant in Natural Historians.
