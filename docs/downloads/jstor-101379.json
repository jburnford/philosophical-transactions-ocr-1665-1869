  "text": "17. The Anatome of an Hedge-hog, in which was found a Muscle of a circular form embracing the panniculus carnosus, and reaching to the feet, tail and head of the animal, and thereby afflicting it for a circular contraction at its pleasure.\n\n18. Of the Womb of a Hare dissolving her own fetus; which our Author from Mons. Steno attributes to a menstruum furnished by nature, and fit to prevent putrefaction. Whence some hope is raised for such women as retain dead children, if from other causes they abound not with putrid humors.\n\n29. Of a poor Parisian Woman, which having for three years together taken no other food but Spirit of Wine, was thence burnt to ashes, when on a certain evening she sat down & fell asleep in a chair of straw.\n\n20. That at Copenhagen, the Magnetick Needle did then vary 3 deg. 35 min. Westward; and that with the same Needle the variation at Huenna, being but 3 miles from Copenhagen, was found to be 2 deg. and 35 min. These observations were made by Dr. Erasmus Bartholin and Monsieur Picard, two able and accurate observers.\n\n21. That by reason of the suspicion, which some considerable men entertain of the Variation of the Meridian, they have made in a convenient place at Copenhagen an accurate Meridian, for future observation and comparison.\n\n22. That the Norwegians make use with great success of Tar of Fir-trees in Malignant Fevers, by drinking it in their bier: And that they employ the powder and moss of that Wood in very dangerous wounds; as also that Pitch is a present remedy for the Gout.\n\n23. That an excessive fatness in a man of above 60 years of age was cured by Pills made of Mercruius dulcis, causing a great salivation: Where the Author notes from Dr. Borrichius, that, though it hath been already known, that a noysom pituita is discharged by the Salival glands, yet 'tis new, that the cause of too much fatness is carried off by the same way.\n\n25. That a live Hedgehog being shut up in a great pipkin, and a flame made about it, the animal for a long while gave not any sign of pain; only it had contracted itself into the shape of a very round ball, shooting out his bristles round about, as if he would make them fight against the violence of the fire: which lasted a great while to the amazement of the bystanders, who took notice, that at length, all about him being red hot, and the flame striking upon his panniculus carnosus, and the bristles falling off together with it, the poor creature died with no other revenge than a slight grunting noise.\n\n24. That the Humors of the Eyes of Gees and Hens, even the Chrysalin, have been restored, together with the sight, without any art, by Nature alone, and that perhaps by the afflux of the nervous liquor of the animals.\n\nLondon, Printed for J. Martyn, printer to the Royal Society, 1673.",
