However, it is to be observed, that I had already gathered more Nitre than I put into the Pot at first; though, as I said before, for what I could perceive, I had taken all or near all the Nitre that I first put in together with the Sulphur, out of the Pot in a Lump. Hence we may have some Conceptions of the Nature of mineral Earths, and how they grow and increase, when once impregnated with the Seeds of a Mineral. This likewise is a Proof of the Quantity of nitrous Particles with which the Air abounds, since the large Quantity of Nitre which I collected out of the Pot, when left empty upon the Shelf, could be supplied by the Air only.\n\nN.B. These three Experiments are all that I could save intire out of a great Number which were sent to the Hon. Mr. Boyle, in Answer to a Letter from him to Mr. John Clayton, containing 17 Quare's.\n\nRobert Corke.\n\nVII. Extract of a Letter from John Rutty, M.D. to Dr. Mortimer, Secr. R.S. concerning the Poison of Laurel-Water.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nReceived thine of Feb. 15. with the Transactions No 418 and 420. giving an Account of the Experiments upon Laurel-Water. I wish your Experiments\nments with the Milk, had more fully determin'd and ascertain'd it to be an Antidote, than they have yet done. I am informed by Dr. ——— that some Apothecaries in England, being used to sophisticate Black-Cherry-Water with Laurel-Leaves, will not be persuaded, that this is a Poison on human Bodies, notwithstanding our few Instances. I can now confirm that it really is so by this Story, which thou mayst be assured of the Truth of.\n\nAt Lisminy in Westmeath, a Girl of 18 Years old, very well and healthy, took a Quantity, less than two Spoonfuls, of the first Runnings of the Simple Water of Laurel-Leaves; whereupon within half a Minute she fell down, was convulsed, foamed at the Mouth, and died in a short time, nor was there any Swelling on her Body.\n\nPrinted for T. Woodward, at the Half-Moon, between the Two Temple-Gates in Fleetstreet; and C. Davis, the Corner of Pater noster-row, next Warwick-lane; Printers to the Royal Society. M.DCC.XLII.\n\nN.B. The Philosophical Transactions being three Years behind-hand in regard of Time, we shall skip over 10 Numbers, and commence the Transactions for the current Year 1742. and the XLIIId Volume with No° 462. and so continue to publish the Papers for the future in the precise Order of the Times of their being read before the Royal Society; in the mean time this XLIst Volume, or the Transactions from No° 452. to 462. shall be filled up with all possible Speed.",
