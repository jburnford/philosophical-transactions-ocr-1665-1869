Fairbairn, Esq., C.E., F.R.S., and Thomas Tate, Esq.\n\nReceived May 3,—Read May 12, 1859.\n\nThe recently published experiments upon the collapse of tubes of wrought iron*, led to results so novel and so much at variance with the ordinary rules of practice, as to exemplify anew the caution and diligence which are requisite in investigating the physical laws of nature, in order to arrive at just conclusions in regard to the properties of materials and their most effective distribution for the purposes of construction.\n\nIn the experiments alluded to, it was clearly shown that the prevailing ideas of the strength of vessels subjected to a uniform external force were erroneous and at variance with the laws of resistance to collapse under such circumstances; whilst in practice the prevalence of error in this matter had led to serious and sometimes fatal accidents, arising out of the construction of vessels of inadequate strength to sustain the pressures placed upon them. These errors, it is hoped, need no longer be perpetuated: the experiments on wrought iron indicated a means of increasing the strength of boiler flues and other vessels of that material, subjected to a collapsing force, to any required amount; and this was the immediate practical application of the general law then discovered, that the strength of cylindrical vessels, exposed to a uniform external force, varied inversely as the length between the rigid ends.\n\nThe results deduced from the experiments on tubes composed of riveted plates were so important as to suggest further inquiry, under the same conditions of rupture, but with other materials, differing in their physical properties from wrought iron. The joints in the tubes employed in those experiments were defects the influence of which might be determined by experiments upon homogeneous vessels. The ductile yielding character of wrought iron suggested the extension of the experiments to hard, rigid materials, more capable of retaining their form under pressure.\n\nTo fulfil the conditions thus sought for, glass was selected for experiment, as a material differing totally in character from wrought iron, and on that account well fitted to supply data for extending our knowledge of the laws of collapse. Of vitreous structure, rigid, elastic, and brittle, and of low tenacity, it possessed the further advantage of being easily obtained and blown into homogeneous vessels of the required forms. But there were other reasons which had weight in making this selection. Our acquaintance with\n\n* Philosophical Transactions, 1858, pp. 389—413. Erratum in that paper: at page 408, in the place of “and by an obvious transformation,” read “and when $k=0.43$, by an obvious transformation”.\n\nMDCCCLIX.\nthe strength of glass, in the various forms in which it is employed in the arts and in scientific research, is very limited; and often as it is employed in circumstances in which it is exposed to pressure, few attempts have been made to register observations of its strength. Some researches on the density of steam at high pressures, now in progress, led to an examination of the subject, and added, to other reasons for testing its powers of resistance, the immediate necessity of knowing more of its properties before it could be trusted in those experimental inquiries.\n\nOur knowledge of the cohesive properties of glass is so defective, that, to arrive at satisfactory and complete results, it was deemed advisable to ascertain by direct experiment its tenacity, or resistance to a tensile strain, its resistance to a crushing force, and, in the form of globes and cylinders, to determine its resistance to an internal bursting force and to an external pressure tending to produce rupture by collapse. The results of the experiments upon glass globes and cylinders will, it is believed, form decided contributions to our present knowledge relative to the laws which determine the strength of materials. One remarkable result is that the law expressing the resistance of glass cylinders to compression is precisely similar to that which has been established for sheet-iron cylinders.\n\nThe glass experimented upon was of three kinds, known commercially as\n\nBest Flint-glass,\nCommon Green Glass, and\nExtra White Crown-glass.\n\nThe flint-glass obtained from Messrs. Molineaux, Webb, and Co., Manchester, was made of sand, oxide of lead, and carbonate of potash, in the following proportions:\n\nSand . . . . . . . . . . . . 54 per cent.\nRed oxide of lead . . . . . 22 per cent.\nCarbonate of potash . . . . 24 per cent.\n\nThis glass is of a fine transparent character, fusible, and of a high specific gravity, due to the large percentage of lead in its composition.\n\nThe green and crown-glass were obtained from Messrs. Chance Brothers of Birmingham, and were made of sand, soda, and lime in the following proportions:\n\nCommon Green Glass.\n\nSand . . . . . . . . . . . . 100 parts\nSulphate of soda . . . . . 42 parts\nCarbonate of lime . . . . . 45 parts\n\nThis is a hard infusible glass of a green colour, transparent, but of a less density than the flint-glass.\nWhite Crown-glass.\n\nSand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100 parts.\nCarbonate of soda . . . . . . . . . . . 38 parts.\nLime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 parts.\n\nA clear transparent glass, hard under the action of the grindstone, and highly infusible. The specific gravity of these different kinds of glass varies greatly; the following Table gives the result of several determinations:\n\n| Glass Type          | Specific Gravity |\n|---------------------|------------------|\n| Best flint-glass    | 3·0787           |\n| Best flint-glass    | 3·0777           |\n| Common green glass  | 2·5279           |\n| Common green glass  | 2·5289           |\n| White crown-glass   | 2·4498           |\n| White crown-glass   | 2·4510           |\n\nMean:\n- 3·0782\n- 2·5284\n- 2·4504\n\nSection I.—Tenacity of Glass.\n\nA few experiments were made upon the tenacity of glass, by tearing specimens asunder by a direct tensile strain. These results, however, owing to the following circumstances, are not so satisfactory as could be wished. In breaking glass by the method adopted for other materials, namely, by suspending weights to it, there is danger that its great rigidity and brittleness may occasion its fracture before the entire cohesive force has been balanced by the strain applied, from the vibration of laying on the weights. In the experiments upon globes, however, in which a uniform water pressure was employed, the tenacity of the glass was ascertained with more accuracy, and any failure in the present experiments is therefore the less to be regretted. The glass to be broken by a tensile strain was obtained of the form shown in fig. 1, drawn smaller at the middle to secure fracture at that part. These specimens were fixed in a pair of wrought-iron shackles, and rested by their shoulders upon a thick india-rubber washer placed on the turned faces of the shackles. In this state they were suspended to a firm support, and a scale-pan attached to the lower shackle. Weights were then added, with the greatest care, till the specimen fractured. In this manner the following results were obtained:\n\nExperiment 1.\n\nAnnealed Flint-glass.\n\nLeast diameter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0·57 in.\nLeast area . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0·255 sq. in.\nBreaking weight, 583 lbs. = 2286 lbs. per square inch.\nThe fracture took place at \\(a\\), fig. 1, and presented a regular smooth convex surface. No notch had been cut in this specimen.\n\n**Experiment 2.**\n\n*Annealed Flint-glass.*\n\nLeast diameter . . . . 0·50 in.\nLeast area . . . . 0·196 sq. in.\nBreaking weight, 499 lbs. = 2540 lbs. per square inch.\n\nBroke in the notch at \\(b\\), fig. 1, which in this case was cut by the grindstone. It is possible that the exterior coat of glass may be stronger than its core, in which case the above specimen was weakened. In the next experiments the specimens were drawn thinner by heat.\n\n**Experiment 3.**\n\n*Common Green Glass.*\n\nLeast diameter . . . . 0·53 in.\nLeast area . . . . 0·220 sq. in.\nBreaking weight, 639 lbs. = 2896 lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Experiment 4.**\n\n*White Crown-glass.*\n\nLeast diameter . . . . 0·54 in.\nLeast area . . . . 0·229 sq. in.\nBreaking weight, 583 lbs. = 2545 lbs. per square inch.\n\nBroke at shoulder \\(a\\), fig. 1.\n\nThe following Table exhibits at one view the results of these experiments, which, notwithstanding the objections to the method by which they were obtained, appear to be consistent with each other.\n\n**Table I.—Tensile Strength of Glass Bars.**\n\n| Description of glass | Area of specimen, in inches | Breaking weight, in lbs. | Tenacity per square inch, in lbs. | in tons. |\n|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|\n| Flint-glass .......... | 0·255                      | 583                      | 2286                             | 1·02    |\n|                       | 0·196                      | 499                      | 2540                             | 1·13    |\n| Green glass .......... | 0·220                      | 639                      | 2896                             | 1·29    |\n| Crown-glass .......... | 0·229                      | 583                      | 2546                             | 1·14    |\n\nIt may be observed here, in anticipation, that the tensile strength is much smaller in the case of glass fractured by a direct strain in the form of bars, than when burst by internal pressure in the form of thin globes. This difference is no doubt mainly due to the fact that thin plates of this material generally possess a higher tenacity than stout bars, which, under the most favourable circumstances, may be but imperfectly\nannealed. There is also a considerable discrepancy between the strength of green and crown-glass when in the form of bars and when in the form of globes. In the case of the bars, the results are as $1 \\cdot 0$ to $1 \\cdot 13$ in favour of green glass, whilst in the case of the globes, the results are as $1 \\cdot 0$ to $1 \\cdot 2$ in favour of the crown-glass. These discrepancies may, however, be accounted for from the different condition of the material in relation to annealing in the two cases, or from an imperfect bedding of the specimen, causing a distortion of the strain out of the direction of the axis of the specimen, or from accidental vibration in laying on the weights.\n\n**Section II.—Resistance of Glass to Crushing.**\n\nThe next series of experiments was instituted with a view of determining the powers of resistance of glass to a direct crushing force. The specimens subjected to experiment were small cylinders (fig. 2) varying in length from 1 to 2 inches, and about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. They were placed for the purpose of crushing within the box $a$ (fig. 3), thin packings of soft lead being interposed between the glass and the parallel crushing surfaces of the box and its solid steel piston $b$; in this way a firm and uniform bearing surface was secured, and the crushing force was applied perpendicularly in the direction of the axis of the specimen. Fig. 3 exhibits the general arrangement of the crushing apparatus, consisting of a lever $A$, 8 feet long, supported on a strong cast-iron base $B$, $B$. The crushing force obtained by placing weights in the scale-pan hung at the extremity of the lever is transmitted through the piston $b$, to the specimen to be crushed, $c$.\nFlint-glass Cylinders.\n\nExperiment 1.\n\nDiameter . . . . . . . . 0·85 inch.\nArea . . . . . . . . . . 0·5674 square inch\nHeight . . . . . . . . . 1·0 inch.\nPlaced between india-rubber packings.\n\nThis specimen having been slightly fractured at an early stage in the experiment, it was taken out and the fractured side ground flat preparatory to another trial.\n\nExperiment 2.\n\nThe same specimen as in Experiment 1.\n\nDiameter . . . . . . . . . . 0·85 inch.\nHeight of segment (ab) . . . . . . 0·73 inch.\nArea . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0·555 inch.\nHeight of specimen . . . . . . 1·0 inch.\n\nWeights added, Total weight,\nin lbs. in lbs.\n\n| Weights added, Total weight, |\n|-----------------------------|\n| in lbs. in lbs.             |\n| 1321 | 1321 | 224 | 10569 |\n| 2080 | 3401 | 224 | 10793 |\n| 896  | 4297 | 224 | 11017 |\n| 896  | 5193 | 224 | 11241 |\n| 896  | 6089 | 224 | 11465 |\n| 896  | 6985 | 224 | 11689 |\n| 896  | 7881 | 224 | 11913 |\n| 448  | 8329 | 224 | 12137 |\n| 448  | 8777 | 224 | 12361 |\n| 448  | 9225 | Fractured | 224 | 12585 |\n| 224  | 9449 | 112 | 12697 |\n| 224  | 9673 | 112 | 12809 |\n| 224  | 9897 | 112 | 12921 |\n| 224  | 10121 | 112 | 13033 | Crushed |\n| 224  | 10345 |\n\nFractured with 9,225 lbs. = 16,621 lbs. per square inch.\nCrushed with 13,033 lbs. = 23,483 lbs. per square inch.\n\nIt will not be necessary again to repeat in detail the steps by which the weights were augmented, as these were similar in every case.

The larger weight, however, had been fairly sup-\nported.\n\nCrown-glass Cylinders.\n\nThe two cylinders of crown-glass were slightly rounded towards the edge of the bear-\ning surfaces, which reduced the area directly subjected to the crushing force. It is\ntherefore probably most accurate to take the less area in reducing the results.\n\nExperiment 10.\n\nDiameter . . . . . . {0·72 inch at middle.\n                      {0·68 inch at ends.\nArea

therefore, from the above experiments, equivalent to 13·460 tons per square inch. Assuming the above numbers to represent the comparative values of each kind of glass, and taking flint-glass as the standard, we have their respective strengths as follow:\n\n- Green glass . . . 1152\n- Crown-glass . . . 1124\n- Flint-glass . . . 1000\n\nThe specimens were crushed almost to powder from the violence of the concussion, when they gave way; it however appeared that the fractures occurred in vertical planes, splitting up the specimen in all directions. This characteristic mode of disintegration has been noticed before, especially with vitrified brick and indurated limestone. The experiments following on cubes of glass which were exposed to view during the crushing process, illustrated this subject further: cracks were noticed to form some time before the specimen finally gave way; then these rapidly increased in number, splitting the glass into innumerable irregular prisms of the same height as the cube; finally these bent or broke, and the pressure, no longer bedded on a firm surface, destroyed the specimen. The annexed ideal sketch (fig. 5) may give some notion of the fractures of a cube, supposing all the particles were restored to their position after crushing.\n\nThe specimens employed in the following experiments were cut from the square heads of the pieces of glass employed in the experiments on tensile strain (fig. 1). These pieces were approximately cubical; and their size prevented their insertion in the box \\(a\\) (fig. 3); they were therefore crushed between parallel steel discs, exposed to view. The crushing was more gradual, and was not effected so completely in these experiments as in those on small cylinders, the fragments being in every case larger after the conclusion of the experiment: it must further be recollected, in comparing these with the preceding experiments, that the cylinders were cut off, of the required length, from rods of glass drawn out when molten to the diameter desired, so\nas to retain the first-cooled exterior skin of glass, which is probably of greater tenacity than the interior; on the other hand, the cubes were cut from the centre of larger lumps of glass, and were possibly in a state of imperfect annealing.\n\n**Flint-glass Cubes.**\n\n**Experiment 12.**\n\nArea = $0.96 \\times 0.97$ inch = $0.9312$ square inch.\nHeight = $1.15$ inch.\nCrushed suddenly with $13,257$ lbs. = $14,235$ lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Experiment 13.**\n\nArea = $0.99 \\times 0.98$ inch = $0.9702$ square inch.\nHeight = $1.16$ inch.\nCrushed with $12,809$ lbs. = $13,202$ lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Experiment 14.**\n\nArea = $0.98 \\times 1.02$ inch = $0.9996$ square inch.\nHeight = $1.10$ inch.\nCrushed with $13,257$ lbs. = $13,262$ lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Experiment 15.**\n\nArea = $0.98$ inch $\\times$ $0.98$ in. = $0.9604$ square inch.\nHeight = $1.10$ inch.\nFractured with $6537$ lbs. = $6806$ lbs. per square inch.\nCrushed with $11,353$ lbs. = $11,820$ lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Green Glass Cubes.**\n\n**Experiment 16.**\n\nArea = $1.0 \\times 0.98$ inch = $0.98$ square inch.\nHeight = $1.0$ inch.\nCrushed with $20,059$ lbs. = $20,468$ lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Experiment 17.**\n\nArea = $0.99 \\times 1.2$ inch = $1.188$ square inch.\nHeight = $1.0$ inch.\nCrushed with $23,535$ lbs. = $19,945$ lbs. per square inch.\nCrown-glass Cube.\n\nExperiment 18.\n\nArea = 0.82 × 0.92 inch = 0.7534 square inch.\nHeight = 0.9 inch.\nCrushed with 16,475 lbs. = 21,867 lbs. per square inch.\n\nThis crushed suddenly after bearing the weight some time, and was reduced almost to powder.\n\nTable IV.—Summary of the Results of Experiments on the Resistance of Cut Glass Cubes to Compression.\n\n| Description of glass | Area of specimen, in square inch. | Crushing weight, in lbs. | Resistance to crushing per square inch, in lbs. | in tons. |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Flint-glass          |                                  |                         |                                               |          |\n|                      | 0.9312                           | 13,257                  | 14,235                                        | 6.355    |\n|                      | 0.9702                           | 12,809                  | 13,202                                        | 5.894    |\n|                      | 0.9996                           | 13,257                  | 13,262                                        | 5.921    |\n|                      | 0.9604                           | 11,353                  | 11,820                                        | 5.276    |\n| Green glass          |                                  |                         |                                               |          |\n|                      | 0.9800                           | 20,059                  | 20,468                                        | 9.116    |\n|                      | 1.1880                           | 23,535                  | 19,945                                        | 8.904    |\n| Crown-glass          |                                  |                         |                                               |          |\n|                      | 0.7534                           | 16,475                  | 21,867                                        | 9.762    |\n\nHence the mean resistance to crushing of cubes of glass is equivalent to a weight of—\n\nFor flint-glass . . . . . . 13,130\nFor green glass . . . . . . 20,206\nFor crown-glass . . . . . . 21,867\nMean . . . . . . . . . . . 18,401\n\nComparing these with the preceding results on glass cylinders, we have the mean resistance of the former experiments to the mean resistance of the above as 30,153 : 18,401, or as 1.6 : 1.\n\nGeneral Observations relative to the Results of the Experiments on the Resistance of Glass Cylinders and Cubes to Crushing.\n\nWith iron and some other materials, when a short column undergoes a pressure in the direction of its length, rupture takes place in a plane having a determinate angle to the axis of the column, this plane being the section of least resistance. Neglecting the friction of the surfaces, Coulomb found this angle to be 45°; and allowing on an average 10° for the limiting angle of friction, the angle of the plane of rupture may be taken at 55°. To fulfil this condition, the length of the column to be crushed should be at least three times its radius: when the length greatly exceeds this limit, the rupture will be effected by the tendency of the column to bend; and when the length is within this limit,\nthe force requisite to produce rupture will be increased in consequence of the irregular form of the line of fracture. These theoretical deductions have been confirmed by experiments made upon columns of iron, wood, bone, stone, and other materials. The results of the experiments here recorded, however, show that when the length of the cylinder does not greatly differ from three times its radius, the resistance to a crushing force is pretty nearly a constant, viz. on an average $12\\cdot313$ tons per square inch in the case of flint-glass, $14\\cdot227$ tons in the case of green glass, and $13\\cdot84$ tons in the case of crown-glass. But, according to Coulomb's law, the cubes of flint-glass (their lengths being considerably less than three times their semi-diameters) should have presented higher powers of resistance than the cylinders; this discrepancy is probably owing to the injury which the glass had sustained in the process of cutting, and to the imperfect annealing of glass when cast in the form of cubes and cylinders.\n\n**Section III.—Resistance of Glass Globes and Cylinders to Internal Pressure.**\n\nIn the following experiments it has been sought not only to determine the law of resistance to internal pressure, which is already well known from theoretical considerations, but to ascertain the direct tensile strength of the glass (of which the bursting pressure is a function) by a method free from many of the objections to that described in Section I. The bursting pressure of cylindrical and spherical vessels is well known to be in the ratio of the tenacity of the material, other things being the same, and the determination of the tensile strength upon this principle, presents in the case of glass peculiar advantages. As glass can be obtained in tolerably perfect spheres, and as the fracture of these may be effected by a uniform water pressure, increasing slowly and regularly without vibration, there is a better chance of ascertaining the ultimate resistance of the material, from the absence of those shocks and irregularities which are inseparable from any process depending upon the piling up of weights, however carefully conducted.\n\nIn making these experiments, a number of glass globes were procured of varying size and thickness. The stems were then flanched out by the blowpipe (fig. 6), and the diameter having been carefully measured, they were ready for experiment. To effect their rupture, each globe, $k$ (fig. 7), was attached by means of a stuffing-box ($a$) to the cover of a strong wrought-iron boiler $B$, and was enclosed by the iron cylindrical vessel $d$, to prevent the dispersion of the fragments when rupture took place. In the stuffing-box the flanch of the stem of the globe was bedded upon vulcanized india-rubber, in such a manner as to secure a watertight attachment without impeding the access of the water to the interior of the globe. The boiler was connected with a hydraulic pump by means of the pipe $b$, and an accurate gauge of the Schaeffer construction was fixed to the boiler to register the pressure. With this arrangement it will be seen that as the pumping was continued the water\nwould rise in the globe, compressing the air in its interior, progressively, up to the point at which the resistance of the glass was overcome by the expansive force of the fluid; at that point explosion would take place, the pressure in pounds per square inch being noted both by the eye of the observer and by the maximum finger of the gauge.\n\nIn glass globes generally, the upper half of the sphere \\(a, b, c\\) (fig. 6) is the most spherical, and is approximately uniform in thickness, being however thinnest at \\(b\\), and thickening gradually downwards towards the stem, the lower half \\((a, d, c)\\) being considerably the strongest. Hence it happened, in several cases (in fact in every case in which the point could be determined with certainty from the condition of the fragments), that the globes ruptured first at \\(b\\), the lines of fracture radiating in every direction, passing round the globe as meridians of longitude, and splitting it up into thin bands, varying from \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\)th to \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)th inch in width. In the case of some elongated ellipsoids, it appeared that the fractures occurred horizontally, or perhaps obliquely, from the condition of the fragments attached to the stem. In most cases, however, it was not clear from the fragments which had been the direction of the fracture, although the mode of rupture was the same in every case.\n\nTo ascertain the thickness, several specimens were selected from the thinnest fragments, and each being measured separately by a micrometer screw of fifty threads to\nthe inch and reading on a graduated head to \\(\\frac{1}{5000}\\)th of an inch, the minimum thickness was assumed as that of the part which ruptured, and has been employed in reducing the results.\n\nIt must also be observed that the globes were usually slightly elliptical, in some cases seriously so; the vertical diameter, \\(bd\\) (using the same form of expression as before), being generally less than the horizontal, \\(ac\\). In the following Tables the two diameters are given in each case.\n\n**Flint-glass.**\n\n**Experiment 1.**\n\n*Globe a.* Diameters 4·0 and 3·98 inches.\n\nIn parts of an inch.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Thicknesses measured} & = \\{0·0230 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0256 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0284 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0244 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0302 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0250 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0240\\} \\\\\n\\text{Minimum} & = 0·024 \\text{ inch.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBursting pressure = 84 lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Experiment 2.**\n\n*Globe b.* Diameters 4·0 and 3·98 inches.\n\nIn parts of an inch.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Thicknesses measured} & = \\{0·034 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·032 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·031 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0254 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0256 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·031 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·028\\} \\\\\n\\text{Minimum} & = 0·025 \\text{ inch.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBursting pressure = 93 lbs. per square inch.\n\n**Experiment 3.**\n\n*Globe c.* Diameter 4·0 inches.\n\nIn parts of an inch.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Thicknesses measured} & = \\{0·040 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·0406 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·039 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·039 \\\\\n& \\quad 0·038\\} \\\\\n\\text{Minimum} & = 0·038 \\text{ inch.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBursting pressure = 150 lbs. per square inch.\nExperiment 4.\n\nGlobe d.

In this aspect they are the most important in their bearings and the most novel of any in the present memoir.\n\nThe method of conducting them did not differ in any essential detail from that pursued in the researches upon wrought-iron tubes, described in a former paper. A number of globes of varying dimensions were procured, and hermetically sealed by means of the blowpipe. In this state they were fixed in the interior of the strong wrought-iron boiler B (fig. 10) (capable of sustaining a pressure of about 2500 lbs. per square inch), in the position shown at A. The boiler or vessel B communicated by means of the pipe α, with a hydraulic force-pump having a plunger of three-quarters of an inch diameter, so that a uniform pressure of about 1000 lbs. per square inch could easily be obtained. In order to register the pressure, gauges of the Schaeffer construction (C) were employed, as before, affording, within small limits of error, certain and accurate indications of the increase of pressure obtained by the pump. The collapse of\nthe glass vessel was made known by a loud report, and by the instant recession of the moveable finger of the gauge $i$; the maximum pressure obtained was marked by a second finger $k$, and also, to prevent error from any accidental cause, by the eye of the observer*.\n\nDuring the collapse the globes were reduced to the smallest fragments; in some cases a great part almost to powder, by the violence of the concussion. Hence in these experiments no indication could be found of the mode in which the globes had given way, nor of the direction of the primary lines of fracture.\n\nAfter the globe had been ruptured, the fragments were carefully collected, and a selection having been made of the thinnest, they were measured, as before, by means of a micrometer-screw. The minimum thickness thus determined has been assumed for the thickness of the point of rupture in the calculations.\n\n* In pressure-gauges of the Schaeffer construction a corrugated steel plate measures the force, by expanding under pressure. The indications are communicated by a rack and pinion to the hand of the gauge which moves over a face plate graduated by trial. In principle this gauge does not materially differ from the aneroid barometer.\nFlint-glass.\n\nExperiment 1.\n\nGlobe A.

Generalization of the Results of Experiments on the Resistance of Glass Globes and Cylinders to External Pressure.\n\nLet us assume—\n\nP = the external pressure in pounds per square inch to produce rupture.\nD = the diameter of the globe or tube, as the case may be, in inches.\nk = the thickness of the glass in inches.\np = the pressure P reduced to unity of thickness, viz. k = .01 inch.\nC, α, β, constants to be determined from the data supplied by the experiments.\n\nThen for the globes we assume\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{Ck^\\alpha}{D^\\beta} \\] .......................... (1.)\n\nand for the cylinders\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{C'k^\\alpha}{D^\\beta L^\\gamma} \\] ......................... (2.)\n\nwhere the exponent of the thickness is the same in both formulæ.\n\nHence we find for globes of the same diameter and also for cylinders of the same length and diameter,\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{\\log P_1 - \\log P_2}{\\log k_1 - \\log k_2} \\] .................. (3.)\n\nTaking the results of Experiments I. and II., we find α = 1.35; from V. and VII. we find α = 1.33; from XI. and XII. we find α = 1.28; from XVI. and XVII. we find α = 1.26; and from XV. and XIV. we find α = 2. Hence we get for the mean value of α,\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{5}(1.35 + 1.33 + 1.28 + 1.26 + 2) = 1.4. \\]\n\nAgain, the following formula enables us to reduce the pressure P, of the cylinders as well as of the globes, to unity of thickness,\n\n\\[ \\log p = \\log P - \\alpha \\log (100 k). \\] .................. (4.)\n\nMaking these calculations, we obtain the following Tables of results:\n\nTABLE VIII.—Reduction of the Results of Experiments on the Resistance of Glass Globes to unity of thickness.\n\n| Number of experiment | D.

In order to facilitate calculation, this formula may be written\n\n\\[\n\\log P = 4·6518 + 1·4 \\log (100 k) - 3·4 \\log D. \\quad \\ldots \\quad (10.)\n\\]\n\nCalculating the value of \\(P\\) by this formula from the data of Experiment XXIII., viz. \\(D = 5\\) and \\(k = 0·0125\\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\log P = 4·6518 + 1·4 \\log 1·25 - 3·4 \\log 5 = \\log 258,\n\\]\n\nthat is \\(P = 258\\) lbs. Now this would be the crushing pressure supposing the globe to be flint-glass; but the crushing pressure given by the experiment is 212 lbs.; hence it appears that the resistance of green glass to external pressure differs very little from that of flint-glass. The following Table will show how nearly formula (9.) represents the results of the experiments on glass globes.\nTABLE X.—Results of Experiments on the Resistance of Glass Globes to External Pressure.\n\n| Number of experiment. | D. | k. | P by experiment. | P by formula (9). | Proportional error by formula. |\n|-----------------------|----|----|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| I.                    | 5·05 | -014 | 292             | 292              | 0                             |\n| II.                   | 5·08 | -018 | 410             | 408              | -\\(\\frac{1}{100}\\)            |\n| III.                  | 4·95 | -022 | 470             | 580              | +\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)              |\n| IV.                   | 5·6  | -020 | 475             | 340              | -\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)              |\n| V.                    | 8·22 | -010 | 35              | 35               | 0                             |\n| VI.                   | 8·2  | -012 | 42              | 44·8             | +\\(\\frac{1}{20}\\)             |\n| VII.                  | 8·2  | -015 | 60              | 61·3             | +\\(\\frac{1}{50}\\)             |\n| VIII.                 | 4·0  | -024 | 900*            | 1370             | ...                           |\n| IX.                   | 4·0  | -025 | 900*            | 1450             | ...                           |\n| X.                    | 6·0  | -059 | 1000*           | 1218             | ...                           |\n| XXIII.                | 5·02 | -0125| 212†            | 258              | +\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)              |\n\nThe lengths of the cylinders of Experiments XI., XII., and XIII. are the same, and their diameters are nearly equal to one another. The same observation applies to the cylinders of Experiments XIV. and XV., and also to Experiments XVI. and XVII. In order, therefore, to reduce the pressures \\(p\\) to uniformity of diameter, we may assume, for such small differences, that \\(D\\) varies as \\(\\frac{1}{P}\\). These reductions being made, we may obtain the following Table:\n\nTABLE XI.—Reduction of the Results of Experiments on Glass Cylinders to uniformity of Diameter, &c.\n\n| Number of experiment. | D.
