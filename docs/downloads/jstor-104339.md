Wax to give it Electricity, I brought it near the Feather, which it attracted strongly, though it had repelled it before, when the Feather had been made electric by Wax.

Afterwards I made the Feather electric by the Wax, which first attracted and then repelled it: And, having applied the rubbed Tube to the Feather, it attracted it strongly, though it repelled it when the Feather was made electric by another glass Tube.

XXI. Electrical Experiments made before the Royal Society, on Thursday, March 15th 1740-1. by the Same.

Having shewn lately by some plain Experiments, that the Electricity of Glass is different from that of Sealing-wax; because the Wax attracted a Feather suspended in the Air by a fine Silk, when the rubbed glass Tube repelled it, (as described in the Account of those Experiments) I made the Experiment with a Cake of Rosin instead of Sealing-wax; and it appeared to have the same kind of Electricity as the Sealing-wax. Then considering that the Supporters of any non-electric Conductors of Electricity must themselves be electric, I had a mind to try whether Bodies, endued with either kind of Electricity, were in any-wise different in that Case; which I did by the following Experiments:

I laid a Piece of Wood, Four Foot long, on Two glass Plates, whose Ends stood One Foot beyond the Side of the Table on which they were laid: Then, ap-
applying the rubbed Tube to one End of the Wood; the other attracted Leaf-brass, or a Thread hanging down from a Stick. Then, instead of the glass Plates, I laid the long Piece of Wood on Two Cakes of Rosin, and applied the rubbed Tube to the End of the said Wood, which conducted the Electricity to the other End, where Leaf-brass and the Thread were attracted in the same Manner.

This shews that, in order to conduct Electricity along any non-electric Body, it is indifferent what Kind of Electricity its Supporters are endowed with, provided they are electric.

Honoured SIR,

As the frequent Dissection of morbid Bodies tends greatly to ascertain the Diagnostic and Prognostic of Diseases, during my Studies, and for the first Six or Eight Years of my Practice, I applied myself to it with great Affiduity.—Some few of the more remarkable Cases, I have met with, I beg Leave to send you from time to time; and, if any of them appear to you worthy of that Honour, you may lay them before the ROYAL SOCIETY.—The following may
