And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued.\n\nBut the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable that a Committee of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752. And the grounds of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgement of their respective authors.\n\nIt is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body,\nupon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore\nthe thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors\nof such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through\nwhose hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a\nmatter of civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communi-\ncations. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions,\nand curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors\nwhereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report and even to\ncertify in the public newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and\napprobation. And therefore it is hoped that no regard will hereafter be paid to such\nreports and public notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited,\nto the dishonour of the Society.\n\nThe Meteorological Journal hitherto kept by the Assistant Secretary at the Apart-\nments of the Royal Society, by order of the President and Council, and published in\nthe Philosophical Transactions, has been discontinued. The Government, on the\nrecommendation of the President and Council, has established at the Royal Obser-\nvatory at Greenwich, under the superintendence of the Astronomer Royal, a Magnet-\nical and Meteorological Observatory, where observations are made on an extended\nscale, which are regularly published. These, which correspond with the grand\nscheme of observations now carrying out in different parts of the globe, supersede\nthe necessity of a continuance of the observations made at the Apartments of the\nRoyal Society, which could not be rendered so perfect as was desirable, on account\nof the imperfections of the locality and the multiplied duties of the observer.\nA List of Public Institutions and Individuals, entitled to receive a copy of the Philosophical Transactions of each year, on making application for the same directly or through their respective agents, within five years of the date of publication.\n\nIn the British Dominions.\nThe Queen's Library.\nThe Admiralty Library.\nThe Radcliffe Library, Oxford.\nThe Royal Geographical Society.\nThe United Service Museum.\nThe Royal College of Physicians.\nThe Society of Antiquaries.\nThe Linnean Society.\nThe Royal Institution of Great Britain.\nThe Society for the Encouragement of Arts.\nThe Geological Society.\nThe Horticultural Society.\nThe Royal Astronomical Society.\nThe Royal Asiatic Society.\nThe Royal Society of Literature.\nThe Medical and Chirurgical Society.\nThe London Institution.\nThe Entomological Society of London.\nThe Zoological Society of London.\nThe Institute of British Architects.\nThe Institution of Civil Engineers.\nThe Cambridge University Philosophical Society.\nThe Royal Society of Edinburgh.\nThe Royal Irish Academy.\nThe Royal Dublin Society.\nThe Asiatic Society at Calcutta.\nThe Royal Artillery Library at Woolwich.\nThe Royal Observatory at Greenwich.\nThe Observatory at Dublin.\nThe Observatory at Armagh.\nThe Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.\nThe Observatory at Madras.\nThe Observatory at Paramatta.\nThe Observatory at Edinburgh.\n\nDenmark.\nThe Royal Society of Sciences at Copenhagen.\nThe Royal Observatory at Altona.\n\nFrance.\nThe Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris.\nThe Royal Academy of Sciences at Toulouse.\nThe Ecole des Mines at Paris.\nThe Geographical Society at Paris.\nThe Entomological Society of France.\nThe Dépôt de la Marine, Paris.\nThe Geological Society of France.\nThe Jardin des Plantes, Paris.\n\nGermany.\nThe University at Göttingen.\nThe Cæsarean Academy of Naturalists at Bonn.\nThe Observatory at Manheim.\nThe Royal Academy of Sciences at Munich.\n\nItaly.\nThe Institute of Sciences, Letters and Arts, at Milan.\nThe Italian Society of Sciences at Modena.\nThe Royal Academy of Sciences at Turin.\n\nSwitzerland.\nThe Société de Phys. et d'Hist.

Astronomy; Physiology, including the Natural History of Organized Beings.\n2. Physics; Geology or Mineralogy.\n3. Mathematics; Chemistry.\n\nThat, in case no paper, coming within these stipulations, should be considered deserving of the Royal Medal, in any given year, the Council have the power of awarding such Medal to the author of any other paper on either of the several subjects forming the Cycle, that may have been presented to the Society and inserted in their Transactions; preference being given to the subjects of the year immediately preceding: the award being, in such case, subject to the approbation of Her Majesty.\n\nThe Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1845 for the most important unpublished paper in Astronomy, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1842, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1845.\n\nThe Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1845 for the most important unpublished paper in Physiology, including the Natural History of\nOrganized Beings, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1842, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1845.\n\nThe Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1846 for the most important unpublished paper in Physics, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1843, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1846.\n\nThe Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1846 for the most important unpublished paper in Geology or Mineralogy, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1843, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1846.\n\nThe Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1847 for the most important unpublished paper in Mathematics, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1844, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1847.\n\nThe Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1847 for the most important unpublished paper in Chemistry, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1844, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1847.\n\nThe Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1848 for the most important unpublished paper in Astronomy, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1845, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1848.\n\nThe Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1848 for the most important unpublished paper in Physiology, including the Natural History of Organized Beings, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1845, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1848.\nI. **On the Laws of the Tides on the Coasts of Ireland, as inferred from an extensive series of observations made in connection with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland.**   \n*By G.
