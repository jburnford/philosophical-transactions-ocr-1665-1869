Communicated by Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S., &c.\n\nReceived October 31, 1842,—Read February 16, 1843.\n\nH. M. Ship Sulphur, Spithead,\nJuly 22, 1842.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that part of my instructions relating to noon high water at the Island of Otaheite, or Tahiti, I now transmit to you fair copies of the tide-journal registered at the island of Motouta, in the harbour of Papiete, as well as a short comparative series made at Point Venus.\n\nThe island of Motouta, the position before named, is the property of the Queen, and therefore free from intrusion or likelihood of disturbance. It is situated well within the reefs, upon a coral flat, and any wave tumbling over the reef would expend itself before reaching the island.\n\nIt is, at the same time, within the direct influence of the deep water channel, to seaward, but entirely protected by the reef. The swell does not enter by reason of the overlapping tongue of the northern reef, which, projecting westerly, receives and throws off the sea obliquely. The gauge was placed in ten feet of water, and the batten in four.\n\nIn order to prevent any confusion, by change of observers, and thus destroying the interest which a single individual would feel if entrusted with the sole execution of this interesting duty, I selected one of my old followers, Mr. McKinley Richardson, Mate, and placing him in entire charge of the island, furnished him with a tide-gauge of my own construction, as well as a tide-batten.\n\nThe tide-gauge was constructed as follows (Plate IV.)—A square wooden trunk of six inches aperture, \\(a\\), was closed at the bottom, but admitted water by small lateral holes, \\(b\\), six inches from the bottom. This was to prevent any sudden wave which might roll in from affecting the mean level.\n\nWithin this trunk floated a glass cylindrical jar \\(c\\), five inches in diameter by eleven in height, and ballasted with sufficient small shot to half immerse it. It was rendered air-tight by means of the gauge-rod which screwed into an interior stuffed pad against the collar of the exterior.\n\nThe end of this rod was of brass, where it screwed into the float, but for ten feet above was of very light, tough cypress, half an inch in diameter.\n\nAt the summit of the trunk a cap was fitted, \\(d\\), having three friction rollers, through\nwhich the rod traversed freely. Above the trunk, secured to strong uprights, stepping into its exterior sides e, e, the graduated battens rose, having a clear space between them, and very neatly and strongly graduated with black divisions on a white ground.\n\nThe index had a clamp tube, through which the gauge-rod passed, f, when it was finally clamped at the first high water.\n\nThe index was a piece of machinery, per se, ff. It was furnished with fore, as well as back, friction rollers, on springs, amounting to eight, by which it maintained its position steadily, and kept the gauge-rod perpendicular. This machine had been well tested at Bow Island and its imperfections obviated.\n\nThis gauge was fixed upon the abrupt steep of the reef in ten feet water, and well ballasted by pigs of iron, on which it also rested. It was distant from the wall thirty yards, and easily read off by a telescope. It was registered during daylight (from 6 A.M. until 6 P.M.) from the top, so that the least number indicated high water, and vice versa.\n\nThe tide-batten was lashed to the rocks (similarly ballasted) close to the wall of Motouta, in four feet water, and a thick plank enabled the observer to take the closest inspection. It was registered from the bottom by day as well as night, and by day at the same periods as the tide-gauge. The greatest number therefore indicates high water.\n\nAs it is almost impossible to determine the actual moment of high or low water, I had recourse to the method of equal altitudes, within two hours on each side; as the results of my observations on the coast of Lancashire, where the water was subject to a rise and fall of thirty-one feet, always coincided up to the latest half hour.\n\nI have been thus minute in order to satisfy any sceptical minds bent on the maintenance of the absolute noon period, that the minutest attention was devoted to this duty, and the coincidence of the two observers, five miles asunder, will in some points be found to agree minutely.\n\nIt will be seen by reference to the mean tide-levels, subsequently reduced for each day (and not contemplated by the observers themselves), how strictly this duty was attended to, the range never exceeding two inches on either gauge or batten.\n\nThe position at Matavai was at the extremity of Point Venus, which was shielded in a great measure from the influence of the sea, by reefs similar to those at Papiete; but here we had merely tide-battens; the observations, however, were corroborated by repetitions within the rivulet, on a pole with crosses to mark the simultaneous levels, the more readily to deduce the moments of high and low water. These were watched for the last week by Mr. Christopher George, second master, my general assistant in the observatory, and superintendent of the tide-journals.\n\nThese data (from the 22nd to the 27th) are comparable with those observed at Motouta.\n\nBy these documents it will be observed that there were two irregular moments of\nhigh water during each twenty-four hours, and that their range was from 10 A.M. to 2\\textsuperscript{h} 27\\textsuperscript{m} P.M., or nearly 4\\textsuperscript{h} 27\\textsuperscript{m} by day, and 3\\textsuperscript{h} 20\\textsuperscript{m} by night. The influences of the sea or land breezes are not apparent. Indeed, if any such influence be admitted, it is decidedly at variance with the anticipated effect, as the night tides are higher with the land wind off shore.\n\nWith a strong land wind the height generally indicated the same as in calm. But the mean tide-levels before alluded to, distinctly indicate an equable rise and fall.\n\nThe night tides observed at Point Venus do not so exactly accord with those observed at Motouta.\n\nI much regret that we had not an opportunity of observing the whole lunation; but I trust that sufficient has been advanced to satisfy you that no exertion was wanting in carrying through these intricate labours, and that even in their present form they may prove not altogether without interest.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour most obedient Servant,\n\nEdward Belcher, Captain.\n\nCaptain F. Beaufort, R.N.,\nHydrographer.\nAbstract of Tide Observations.—TABLE I.\n\nOtaheite. Island of Motouta.
