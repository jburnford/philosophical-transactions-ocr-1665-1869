  "text": "COMETIS scripsit ediditque, saith, Cassini Tabulas (refractionum) & rationibus & Experimentis esse conformes.\n\nBut Ricciolus, in a late treatise Astronomiae reformatae, hath raised an Expectation of his new Tables of Refraction, and questions those Tables of Cassinus: Who, in this Letter, answereth his objections, and shews, how, by observations in Heliometro, we may try whose Tables are best.\n\nThe second Letter is in Italian, to Carlo Rinaldini Professor of Mathematicks in the University of Padua, dated August 7, 1666.\n\nIn it, He shews some defect in the wayes of making Experiments of Refraction, prescribed by Vitello, Des-Cartes, Riccioli and Manzini. And then he describes an Instrument of his own invention for that purpose, &c.\n\nThe third Letter is in Italian also, but without date: concerning a book of Dr. Mengoli; wherein is a Table of Refractions for every degree of altitude. But Cassinus shews, that Table of Mengoli to be false; as being easily refuted by Experience, and grounded upon a wrong foundation. Most writers of Dioptricks since Des Cartes do agree with him, in acknowledging a constant Ratio in the Sines of the Angles considered in Refraction. But this Doctor Mengoli, mistaking those Angles, hath cast away a great deal of labour in calculating so many Refractions, and so making a Table full of false numbers. But Cassinus hopeth, that Signor Mengoli will review his Principles, and put true ones in their room, that so beginning anew he may reform the Conclusions, which he intended to demonstrate.\n\nIV. Dr. Richard Sharrock's History of the Propagation and Improvement of VEGETABLES; by the Concurrence of Art and Nature. The 2d Edition much enlarged. Oxford, 1672. in 8°.\n\nThis Treatise sheweth the several wayes for the Propagation of Plants usually cultivated in England, as they are increased by Seed, Off-sorts, Suckers, Troucheons, Cutting, Slips, Laying, Circumposition: The several wayes of Graftings and Inoculations; as likewise the Methods for improvement and best culture of Field, Orchard and Garden-plants; the means used for remedy of Annoyances incident to them; together with the Effect of Nature, and her manner of working upon the several endeavors and operations of the Artist. Written according to Observations made from Experience and Practice. Amongst the many considerables in it, there is an Examination of Sr. Ken. Digby's reports, and other stories of great fame.\n\nErrata in Numb. 83, p. 4060, l. 16, and l. 28. r. refraction for reflexion p. 4075, l. 26 and l. 33. r. need for ferre.\n\nLONDON, Printed for J.
