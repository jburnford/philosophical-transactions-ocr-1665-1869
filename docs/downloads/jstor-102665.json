Secr. concerning some Roman Inscriptions found at York, proving that the Ninth Legion some time resided there.\n\nBy your very kind Letter I perceive how much I am obliged to the Society for so candid a reception of my poor Endeavours, which encourages me to transmit two Roman Inscriptions found at York, one very lately, the other several years ago, but nowhere yet taken notice of, tho it hath this very remarkable, That it is an undeniable Argument that the Ninth Legion was not only in Britain, which is rarely taken notice of, but that it resided at York; which was heretofore unknown. It is a Funeral Monument, whereupon, under the Statue (in Basse-relieve) of the Standard-bearer of the 9th Legion, is this Inscription.\n\nL. DVCCIVS\n\n* Lubens voluit *L. VOT. RVFL\n-NVS- VIEN\nSIGN. LEG.VIII-\nAN.XXIIIX-\n\nHic situs est. H. S. E.\n\nThis Monument was found in Trinity-yard in Micklegate at York, and was happily rescued by my Honoured Friend Dr Bryan Fairfax, from the brutish Workman, who\nwho had broke it in the middle, and were going to make use of it for two *Throughs*, as they call them, in the Wall; but by that worthy Gentleman's direction it was placed upright, with the Inscription outwards. That this 9th Legion was in *Britain* in *Galba*'s time, and that it was also *Hispaniensis*, appears from the very Learned Sir Henry Savile's Notes at the end of his Edition of *Tacitus*; but that it, as well as the VIth and the XXIth, was also called *Victrix*, or that it resided at *York*, has not been observed before; and yet both are evident from this Inscription upon a *Roman* Brick found there.\n\n**LEG. IX. VIC.**\n\nThis is also an Argument of the Peace these Parts enjoyed at that time, (possibly the latter end of Severus's Reign,) making Bricks, casting up Highways, &c. being the usual employment of Souldiers at such vacancies. The former Inscription is now removed to the Gardens of Sir John Goodricks at Ribston; the latter is in my possession.\n\nSir Hen. Savile was of opinion that this *Nona Hispaniensis* in *Britannia* was one of those established by *Tiberius*, *Caius*, or *Claudius*, or peradventure in the later times of *Augustus*; but however that it was certainly here in *Nero*'s Reign, and that *Pactus Cerealis* was then Lieutenant thereof is indisputably evident from *Tacitus*, (*lib.* 14. *cap.* 10.) who gives a lamentable account of the slaughter of seventy thousand Citizens and Confederates, by the enraged *Boudicea*, in which number was all the Foot of this ninth Legion: *Cerealis* with the Horse hardly escaping. I suppose it needless to add, that this Number is frequently by the Romans writ VIII as well as IX; for one that is but competently vers'd in their Coins or Inscriptions, cannot but have observed instances of both kinds; however, to prevent all mistakes, (it being near ten\nten years since I saw this Monument) the Learned and Ingenious Roger Gale, Esq; was so kind as to send me a new Transcript; and I have by me also a third, lately taken by a grave Divine; all which agree that it is the IXth Legion, which is also confirm'd by the other Inscription upon the Brick, which was but lately found. I shall only add what an Ingenious Gentleman of Oxford writes, because it relates to an Author I have not the opportunity to consult here, but is possibly in your Curious Library. \"I am mightily pleased with the Inscriptions you sent me relating to the 9th Legion, there being now no room to doubt about the place of Residence, a thing which was unknown before; and for that reason, those who have written about the Roman Legions have said nothing about this, but leave us quite in the dark; only Ursatus [in his Book de Notis Rom.] does remark, that it must be somewhere in Britain, because Tacitus tells us, that when the Colony at Camalodunum was destroyed by Boadicia, Patilius Cerealis, Legate of the IXth Legion, came to their assistance; but yet he makes no mention of its being stiled Vici. This I receiv'd from Mr Tho. Hearne of Edmund Hall, from whom is expected a curious Edition of Livy.\n\nYour Most Obliged and Obedient Servant,\n\nRalph Thoresby.",
