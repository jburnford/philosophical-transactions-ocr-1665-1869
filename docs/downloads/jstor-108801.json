Vogt, Ph.D.\n\nReceived February 12,—Read March 12, 1863.\n\nIt has been shown* that the conducting-power of several of the pure metals decreased between 0° and 100° to the same extent, namely 29·307 per cent. On continuing the research with other metals and alloys, we have found that thallium and iron form an exception to the above; and in the following we will describe the experiments made with these metals.\n\nThe thallium was kindly lent to us by Mr. Crookes, the discoverer of this new metal, who with great readiness placed a small quantity of it at our disposal.\n\nOn account of its extreme softness (for it is much softer than pure lead), it was easily cut with a knife to fit one of the small presses described in the 'Philosophical Magazine' (February 1857), and pressed without the application of heat. The wire, as soon as it came out of the small hole of the press, passed into a tube filled with water; for although the metal readily oxidizes in air, yet it may be kept under water, free from air, for some time without oxidation. When, however, the wire is exposed to the air for a short time, it loses its lustre and is soon covered with a coating of oxide, which, as in the cases of lead and zinc, protects in a great measure the metal from further oxidation. The error caused by the slight oxidation during the short time we were obliged to manipulate with the wire in air may therefore be overlooked, more especially as wires of the same piece of metal showed the same conducting-power when pressed at different times. Now, if the slight oxidation had any marked effect, we ought to have found great differences in the conducting-power of different wires, for it can scarcely be supposed that in all cases the same amount of oxidation had taken place. Again, although thallium appears to be attacked by alcohol, yet we found we might varnish the wire with a solution of shell-lac in alcohol; for the small quantity of alcohol contained in the first coating of varnish volatilizes so quickly that it has very little time to act on the wire; in fact the resistance of the wire was found to be the same when determined before being varnished, and after three or four coatings of varnish had dried on it. The reason of varnishing the wire was to protect the metal from the action of the hot oil.\n\nThe apparatus and precautions taken whilst determining the conducting-powers at different temperatures have already been fully described†. The normal wires used were\n\n* \"On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting-Power of Metals. By A.

As in the case of wires of most other metals, those of thallium were found to alter in conducting-power after having been kept at $100^\\circ$ for some time. It was therefore necessary to heat them for several days until their conducting-power showed no longer any alteration after cooling to the original temperature.\n\nThe length of the wire experimented with was 158 millims., and its diameter 0·502 millim.\n\nConducting-power found before heating the wire . . . 8·808 at $13^\\circ$ Reduced to $0^\\circ$.  \n\" \" after being kept at $100^\\circ$ for 1 day . . 8·939 ,, 10·8 9·338  \n\" \" 2 days . . 8·941 ,, 11·8 9·378  \n\" \" 3 days . . 8·949 ,, 11·6 9·378  \n\" \" 4 days . . 8·990 ,, 10·2 9·368\n\nThe means of the conducting-powers for each of the following temperatures were—\n\n| T.     | Conducting-power. | Difference. |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------|\n|        | Observed.         | Calculated. |\n| 10·40  | 8·987             | 8·979       | +0·008 |\n| 25·07  | 8·460             | 8·466       | -0·006 |\n| 39·22  | 7·996             | 8·006       | -0·010 |\n| 54·43  | 7·551             | 7·550       | +0·001 |\n| 69·68  | 7·138             | 7·132       | +0·006 |\n| 85·95  | 6·742             | 6·729       | +0·013 |\n| 100·13 | 6·404             | 6·414       | -0·010 |\n\nThe formula deduced from the observations, from which the conducting-powers were calculated, was\n\n$$\\lambda = 9·364 - 0·037936t + 0·00008467t^2,$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\lambda_1 = 100 - 0·40513t + 0·0009042t^2,$$\n\ncorresponding to a percentage decrement of 31·471 per cent.\n\nTo check the above value another wire was made, and its conducting-power determined.\n\nThe length of the wire was 187 millims., its diameter 0·421 millim., and the conducting-power found was\n\n8·610 at $15^\\circ$·6, or, reduced to $0^\\circ$ by the above formula, 9·169.\n\nNow the first observation made with the first wire was 9·29 at $0^\\circ$; or, as mean, we find the conducting-power of pure thallium at $0^\\circ$ equal to 9·23.\n\n* Philosophical Magazine, February 1861.\n† The manner in which these values were reduced is fully described in the paper already alluded to (Philosophical Transactions, 1862, p. 10).\nAlthough we had already found, as will be shown in the following, that the conducting-power of iron decreases between $0^\\circ$ and $100^\\circ$ more than $29\\cdot307$ per cent., the mean value deduced from the percentage decrements of eleven metals, yet we thought it would be interesting to check the above results, and we therefore applied to Professor Lamy, of Lille, for a specimen of the metal, who with great kindness lent us two small bars prepared at different times.

We are indebted to Mr. Crookes for an alloy of thallium and tin containing only traces of the latter metal, and on testing its conducting-power we found it lower than that of pure thallium, showing that the addition of a better conductor (the conducting-power of tin being at $0^\\circ 12\\cdot366$) causes a decrement in the conducting-power of the metal. Again, we alloyed a portion of M. Lamy's thallium with traces of cadmium; and here we also found the above observation confirmed (the conducting-power of cadmium being at $0^\\circ 23\\cdot725$). Thallium, therefore, appears to belong to that class of metals* which, when alloyed with lead, tin, cadmium, or zinc, or with one another, do not conduct electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes, but always in a lower degree than the mean of their volumes, and not to that class of metals to which lead belongs, namely, those which when alloyed with one another conduct electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes.\n\nRespecting the conducting-power of the alloys of thallium, we shall discuss them in our paper \"On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting-Power of Alloys,\" which will shortly be ready for publication.\n\nWe are greatly indebted to the kindness of Professor Percy, who placed at our disposal the specimens of iron used for the following experiments; in fact, with the exception of the two last, they are all from his collection. As several of them have been analysed by Mr. Tookey in his laboratory, the results we have obtained will be the more interesting, as they show how traces of foreign matter influence the conducting-power of iron.\n\nWe will first give the numerical results, and then make some remarks on them.\n\n1. Electrotyle Iron, deposited from a solution of pure sulphate of iron. The strips were very thin and porous; we could not, therefore, obtain concordant values for the conducting-power, but were able to determine the percentage decrement in the conducting-power between $0^\\circ$ and $100^\\circ$. We have therefore taken the first observed conducting-power equal 100.\n\nConducting-power found before heating the strip . . 100·000 at $18\\cdot1$ Reduced to $0^\\circ$ 109·698\n\n\" \" after being kept at $100^\\circ$ for 1 day . 100·520 at $16\\cdot8$ 109·539\n\n\" \" 2 days 100·894 at $15\\cdot9$ 109·443\n\nThe means of the conducting-powers observed at the following temperatures were—\n\n| T. | Conducting-power |\n|----|------------------|\n| 10·0 | 103·926          |\n| 55·0 | 82·866           |\n| 100·0 | 67·528           |\n\nfrom which numbers the following formula was deduced,\n\n$$\\lambda = 109\\cdot38 - 0\\cdot55983t + 0\\cdot001413t^2,$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\lambda_1 = 100 - 0\\cdot51182t + 0\\cdot0012915t^2,$$\n\ncorresponding to a percentage decrement of 38·262 per cent.\n\n* Philosophical Transactions, 1860, p. 162,\n2.

This specimen formed the basis for some experiments made by Dr. Percy on the absorption of carbon by iron, and was cut from the same piece of foil as Nos. 10, 11, 12. The strips of foil were first annealed in a current of dry hydrogen at a red heat for about two hours. No. 9 was therefore annealed in hydrogen, Nos. 10, 11, 12 treated first with No. 9, and then separately under a layer of sugar charcoal in a current of hydrogen for different lengths of time.

It was found that almost the same formula may be deduced from three observations as from seven or more, if the temperature of the second observation is exactly the mean of the other two. Now as at each interval we always made three observations, it was easy with a little practice to regulate the temperature so as to obtain the wished-for temperature as mean. Of course sometimes we had to make four, five, or more observations in order to bring out the desired temperature. By only taking observations at three intervals, the labour of the research, especially of the calculations, was materially diminished.\n\nIn the following Table we have placed together the results obtained with the different sorts of iron:—\nIf we look at the above Table, the following important fact will be obvious, namely, the higher the conducting-power the higher the percentage decrement in the conducting-power between 0° and 100°; in fact we have always found this to be the case; and from experiments made with about 100 alloys in this direction we have not found a single case where the percentage decrement in the conducting-power between 0° and 100° is greater than that of the pure metals; further, we have found that we may deduce the conducting-power of the pure metal from that of the impure one when the impurity in it does not reduce it more than, say, 10 to 20 per cent.; for we have proved experimentally that within those limits the percentage decrement between 0° and 100° in the conducting-power of an impure metal varies in the same ratio as the conducting-power of the impure metal at 100°, compared with that of the pure metal at 100°. Thus the percentage decrement in the conducting-power of pure iron between 0° and 100° is 38·261 per cent., that of No. 5, 36·07 per cent. Now, if the above statement be correct, by multiplying the conducting-power of No. 5 at 100° by $\\frac{38·261}{36·07}$ we shall obtain the conducting-power of the pure metal at 100°, and the conducting-power at 0° by dividing that number by 0·61734.\n\nIn the following Table we give the results of such a calculation with those specimens of iron the conducting-powers of which do not vary more than 20 per cent. from that deduced for the pure metal.\nON THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTING-POWER OF THALLIUM AND IRON.\n\n| Observed conducting-power at 0° | Calculated conducting-power of pure iron at 0° |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| No. 5                         | 15·712                                        |\n| No. 6                         | 15·640                                        |\n| No. 7                         | 14·204                                        |\n| No. 9                         | 14·723                                        |\n| No. 13                        | 13·293                                        |\n| No. 15                        | 13·774                                        |\n| Mean                          | 16·809                                        |\n\nThe reason for making the above deduction will be fully explained in our paper \"On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting-power of Alloys.\" One glance, however, will show that the deduced values agree as well together as can be expected, considering that the results may be modified by the presence of carbon, sulphur, &c. In cases where we may assume that we have only solutions of one metal in another, the concordance in the deduced values is very great; in fact, when we experiment with metals whose conducting-power in a pure state is known, and when the impurity is only dissolved in it, then the deduced conducting-power agrees almost exactly with that found experimentally.\n\nFor resistance-thermometers, as described by Siemens*, the use of an iron wire would give much greater differences for the same increment of temperature than copper; for the resistance of pure copper wire increases for each degree about 0·4 per cent., whereas that of pure iron increases about 0·6 per cent. for each degree.\n\nWhen we found that iron decreased in conducting-power between 0° and 100° more than the pure metals (and here again we will call attention to the fact that we have as yet found no alloy to decrease in conducting-power between 0° and 100° to a greater extent than that which the pure metals composing it would do), we thought that its being a magnetic body might possibly be the reason of it; but after having tested thallium, and found that the conducting-power of that metal also decreases more than that of the pure metals, we knew that this could not well be the case, for thallium is strongly diamagnetic†. Hearing, however, that Professor Wöhler possessed specimens of pure cobalt and nickel wire prepared by M. Deville, we wrote and asked him to lend them to us; this he immediately did, and on testing them we obtained the following results:\n\n**Cobalt wire.**\n\n| Length | Diameter | Conducting-power found before heating the wire | Reduced to 0° |\n|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|\n|        |          | 12·495 at 11°·6                             | 12·899        |\n|        |          | 12·466 at 12°·6                             | 12·905        |\n|        |          | 12·428 at 13°·4                             | 12·894        |\n\n* Report of Government Submarine Cable Committee, p. 454.\n† Lamy, Compt.

It is well known how difficult it is to procure chemically pure iron in a fused state, on account of its decomposing the crucibles in which it is melted and taking up some impurities.\n\nAssuming, therefore, that cobalt and nickel behave like most other pure metals, namely, decrease in conducting-power between $0^\\circ$ and $100^\\circ$, $29\\cdot307$ per cent., we may deduce from the above data the conducting-power of the pure metals.\n\nThe conducting-power of pure cobalt would then be $17\\cdot223$ at $0^\\circ$, and that of pure nickel $13\\cdot106$ at $0^\\circ$.\n\nWe hope shortly to be able to prepare some pure cobalt and nickel by depositing galvanoplastically those metals in the form of foil from solutions of their pure salts, and so to check the above deduced values for the conducting-power of the pure metals.\n\nIn conclusion, we give, in the following Table, the conducting-power of some of the pure metals, in order to show the places which the metals treated of in this paper take.\n\n| Metal          | Conducting-power at $0^\\circ$ |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Silver (hard drawn) | 100·00                        |\n| Copper         | 99·95                         |\n| Gold           | 77·96                         |\n| Zinc           | 29·02                         |\n| Cadmium        | 23·72                         |\n| Cobalt*        | 17·22                         |\n| Iron*          | 16·81                         |\n| Nickel*        | 13·11                         |\n| Tin            | 12·36                         |\n| Thallium       | 9·16                          |\n| Lead           | 8·32                          |\n| Arsenic        | 4·76                          |\n| Antimony       | 4·62                          |\n| Bismuth        | 1·245                         |\n\n* Probable value for the pure metal deduced from the observations with the impure one.",
