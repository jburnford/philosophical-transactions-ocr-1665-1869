  "text": "mention'd from him in Numb. 4 pag. 67, of these Transacti-\nons.\n\nPrepare (saith he) two Glasses, the one exactly flat on both\nsides, the other flat on the one side, and convex on the other,\nof what Sphere you please. Let the flat Glass be a little broa-\nder than the other. Then let there be made a Cell or Ring\nof Brass, very exactly turn'd, into which these two Glasses\nmay be so fastned with Cement, that the plain surfaces of\nthem may lyce exactly paralell, and that the Convex-side of the\nPlano-convex-Glass may lye inward; but so, as not to touch\nthe flat of the other Glass. These being cemented into the\nRing very closely about the edges, by a small hole in the side\nof the Brass-ring or Cell, fill the interposed space between\nthese two with Water, Oyl of Turpentine, Spirit of Wine, Saline\nLiquors, &c; then stop the hole with a screw: and accord-\ning to the differing refraction of the interposed Liquors,\nso shall the Focus of this compound Glass be longer or short-\ner.\n\nBut this (adds the Proposer) I would only have look't upon,\nas one instance of many (for there may be others) of the\nPossibility of making a Glass, ground in a smaller Sphere, to\nconstitute a Telescope of a much greater length: Though\n(not to raise too great expectation) I must add, That of\nSpherical object glasses, those are the best, which are made of\nthe greatest Sphere, and whose substance hath the greatest\nrefraction.\n\nObservations\nAbout Shining Worms in Oysters.\n\nThese Observations occur in the French journal of April 12,\n1666. in two letters, written by M. Auzout to M. Dela\nVoye; whereof the substance may be reduced to the following:\nparticulars.\n\n1. That M. Dela Voye having observed, as he thought,\nsome shining Worms in Oysters; M. Auzout, being made acquainted with it, did first conceive, they were not Worms (unless they were crushed ones) that shin'd, as having not been able then to discern any parts of a Worm; but only some shining clammy moisture; which appeared indeed like a little Star of a bleuish colour, and stuck to the Oyster-shell; being drawn out, shone in the Air its whole length (which was about four or five lines,) and when put upon the Observer's hand, continued to shine there for some time.\n\n2. That M. Auzout afterwards, causing more than 20. dozen of Oysters to be open'd at Candle-light, really saw, in the dark, such shining worms in them; and those of three sorts. One sort was whitish, having 24. or 25. feet on each side, forked; a black speck on one side of the head (taken by him for a Chry stallin) & the back like an Eele, stript off her skin. The second, red, and resembling the common Glowworms, found at Land, with folds upon their backs, and feet like the former; and with a nose like that of a dog, and one eye in the head. The third sort was speckled, having a head like that of a Sole, with many tufts of whitish hair on the sides of it,\n\n3. That, besides these, the Observer saw some much bigger, that were grayish, with a big head, and two horns on it, like those of a Snayl, and with 7. or 8. whitish feet, but these, though kept by him in the night, shin'd not.\n\n4. That the two first sorts are made of a matter easi'v resoluble, the least shaking or touch turning them into a viscos and aqueous matter; which falling from the shell, stuck to the Observers fingers, and shone there for the sp c. of 20. seconds: and if any little part of this matter, by strongly shaking the shell, did fall to the ground, it appear'd like a little piece of a flaming Brimstone; and when shaken off nimbly, it became like a small shining Line, which was dissipated before it came to the ground.\n\n5. That\n5. That this shining matter was of different colour; some, whitish, some, reddish; but yet that they afforded both, a light which appear'd a violet to his eye.\n\n6. That it is very hard to examine these worms entire (especially the white ones) because that at the least touch they doe burst, and resolve into a glutinous moisture; whence also if it were not for their feet, that are discover'd in their matter, none would judge them to be Worms.\n\n7. That among those, which he observed, he saw two more firm, than the rest, which shone all over; and when they fell from the Oyster, twinkled like a great star, shining strongly, and emitting rays of a violet-light by turns, for the space, (as touch't above) of 20 seconds. Which Scintillation the Observer imputes to this, that those worms being alive, and sometimes raising their head, sometimes their tayle, like a Carpe, the light increased and lessened accordingly; seeing that, when they shone not, he did, viewing them by a Candle, find them dead.\n\n8. That forcibly shaking the Oyster-shells in the dark, he sometimes saw the whole shell full of lights, now and then as big as a fingers end; and abundance of this clammy matter, both red and white, (which he judges to have been Worms) burst in their holes.\n\n9. That in the shaking he saw all the Communications of these little Verminulous holes, like to the hole of Worms in Wood.\n\n10. That in more than 20 dozen of Oysters he shook no shell (10. or 12. excepted) but it emitted light: And found some of this light in sixteen of the Oysters themselves.\n\n11. That this light occurs more frequently in big, than small Oysters; in those that are pierced by the Worm, oftner, than in\nin those that are not, and rather upon the Convex-side, than\nthe other; and more in fresh ones, than in the stale.\n\n12. That having somewhat scaled the Convex-side of the\nshell, and discover'd the Communication of the holes, where-\nin the often-mention'd viscous moisture, that has any form of\ninsects, is found; he smelt a scent, that was like the water of a\nsqueezed Oyster.\n\n13. That the Worms give no light, when irritated, but if\nthey do, the light lasts but a very little time, whereas that which\nappears in those, that were not angered before, continues a\ngreat while; the Observer affirming to have kept of it above\n2 hours.\n\nSo far the Journal des Scavans; which intimates withal, that\nif the Observers had had better Microscopes, they could have bet-\nter examin'd this matter.\n\nBut since the curious here in England are so well furnish\nwith good ones, 'tis hoped, that they will employ some of\nthem for further and more minute Observations of these\nWorms; it being a matter, which, joined with other Obser-\nvations, already made by some excellent persons here, (espe-\ncially Mr. Boyle) upon this subject of Light, may prove very\nluciferous to the doctrine of it, so much yet in the dark.\n\nSome Observations\nOf the Effects of Touch and Friction.\n\nThe Operations and Effects of Touch and Friction having\nbeen lately much taken notice off, and being lookt upon by\nsome, as a great Medical Branch, for the curing of many di-\nseases and infirmities; it will perhaps not be unseasonable to\nmention (here also) some Observations relating thereunto;\nwhich may give an occasion to others, to consider this subject\nmore, than has been done heretofore, and to make fur-\nther",
