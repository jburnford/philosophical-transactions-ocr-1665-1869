On the Differential Equations which determine the form of the Roots of Algebraic Equations.\n\nBy GEORGE BOOLE, F.R.S., Professor of Mathematics in Queen's College, Cork.\n\nReceived April 27,—Read May 26, 1864.\n\n1. Mr. Harley* has shown that any root of the equation\n\n\\[ y^n - ny + (n-1)x = 0 \\]\n\nsatisfies the differential equation\n\n\\[\ny - \\left( D - \\frac{2n-1}{n} \\right) \\left( D - \\frac{3n-2}{n} \\right) \\ldots \\left( D - \\frac{n^2 - n + 1}{n} \\right) \\frac{e^{(n-1)\\theta}}{D(D-1) \\ldots (D-n+1)} e^{(n-1)\\theta} y = 0, \\ldots . . .\n\\] \n\n(1)\n\nin which \\( e^\\theta = x \\), and \\( D = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\), provided that \\( n \\) be a positive integer greater than 2. This result, demonstrated for particular values of \\( n \\), and raised by induction into a general theorem, was subsequently established rigorously by Mr. Cayley by means of Lagrange's theorem.\n\nFor the case of \\( n=2 \\), the differential equation was found by Mr. Harley to be\n\n\\[\ny - \\frac{D - \\frac{3}{2}}{D} e^{\\theta} y = \\frac{1}{2} e^{\\theta}. . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\\] \n\n(2)\n\nSolving these differential equations for the particular cases of \\( n=2 \\) and \\( n=3 \\), Mr. Harley arrived at the actual expression of the roots of the given algebraic equation for these cases. That all algebraic equations up to the fifth degree can be reduced to the above trinomial form, is well known.\n\nA solution of (1) by means of definite triple integrals in the case of \\( n=4 \\) has been published by Mr. W. H. L. Russell; and I am informed that a general solution of the equation by means of a definite single integral has been obtained by the same analyst.\n\nWhile the subject seems to be more important with relation to differential than with reference to algebraic equations, the connexion into which the two subjects are brought must itself be considered as a very interesting fact. As respects the former of these subjects, it may be observed that it is a matter of quite fundamental importance to ascertain for what forms of the function \\( \\varphi(D) \\), equations of the type\n\n\\[\nu + \\varphi(D)e^{\\theta u} = 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\\] \n\n(3)\n\nadmit of finite solution. We possess theorems which enable us to deduce from each known integrable form an infinite number of others. Yet there is every reason to think\n\n\\* Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, No. 12, Session 1861–62.\nthat the number of really primary forms—of forms the knowledge of which, in combination with such known theorems, would enable us to solve all equations of the above type that are finitely solvable—is extremely small. It will, indeed, be a most remarkable conclusion, should it ultimately prove that the forms in question stand in absolute and exclusive connexion with the class of algebraic equations here considered.\n\nThe following paper is a contribution to the general theory under the aspect last mentioned. In endeavouring to solve Mr. Harley's equation by definite integrals, I was led to perceive its relation to a more general equation, and to make this the subject of investigation. The results will be presented in the following order:\n\nFirst, I shall show that if \\( u \\) stand for the \\( m \\)th power of any root of the algebraic equation\n\n\\[\ny^n - xy^{n-1} - 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nthen \\( u \\), considered as a function of \\( x \\), will satisfy the differential equation\n\n\\[\n[D]^m u + \\left[ \\frac{n-1}{n} D + \\frac{m}{n} - 1 \\right]^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{D}{n} - \\frac{m}{n} - 1 \\right) e^{\\theta u} = 0,\n\\]\n\nin which \\( e^{\\theta} = x \\), \\( D = \\frac{d}{dx} \\), and the notation\n\n\\[\n[a]_b = a(a-1)(a-2)\\ldots(a-b+1)\n\\]\n\nis adopted.\n\nSecondly, I shall show that for particular values of \\( m \\), the above equation admits of an immediate first integral, constituting a differential equation of the \\( n-1 \\)th order, and that the results obtained by Mr. Harley are particular cases of this depressed equation, their difference of form arising from difference of determination of the arbitrary constant.\n\nThirdly, I shall solve the general differential equation by definite integrals.\n\nFourthly, I shall determine the arbitrary constants of the solution so as to express the \\( m \\)th power of that real root of the proposed algebraic equation which reduces to 1 when \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nThe differential equation which forms the chief subject of these investigations certainly occupies an important place, if not one of exclusive importance, in the theory of that large class of differential equations of which the type is expressed in (3). At present, I am not aware of the existence of any differential equations of that particular type which admit of finite solution at all, otherwise than by an ultimate reduction to the form in question, or by a resolution into linear equations of the first order. It constitutes, in fact, a generalization of the form\n\n\\[\nu + \\frac{a(D-2)^2 + n^2}{D(D-1)} e^{\\theta u} = 0\n\\]\n\ngiven in my memoir \"On a General Method in Analysis\" (Philosophical Transactions for 1844, Part II.).\nDETERMINE THE FORM OF THE ROOTS OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS.\n\nFormation of the Differential Equation.—General finite integral.\n\n2. Proposition.—If \\( u \\) represent the \\( m \\)th power of any root of the algebraic equation\n\n\\[\ny^n - xy^{n-1} - 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nthen \\( u \\), considered as a function of \\( x \\), satisfies the linear differential equation\n\n\\[\n[D]^n u + \\left[ \\frac{n-1}{n} D + \\frac{m}{n} - 1 \\right]^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{D}{n} - \\frac{m}{n} - 1 \\right) e^{\\theta} u = 0,\n\\]\n\nin which \\( e^{\\theta} = x \\), and \\( D = \\frac{d}{dx} \\).\n\nAnd the complete integral of the above differential equation will be\n\n\\[\nu = C_1 y_1^m + C_2 y_2^m + \\ldots + C_n y_n^m,\n\\]\n\n\\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots y_n \\) being the \\( n \\) roots of the given algebraic equation.\n\nRepresenting \\( y^n \\) by \\( z \\), we may give to the proposed algebraic equation the form\n\n\\[\nz = b + xz^{n-1}, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (1)\n\\]\n\nin which \\( b = 1 \\). Hence by Lagrange's theorem\n\n\\[\nu = z^m = b^m + b^{m-1} \\frac{d}{db} \\left( b^m \\right) x + \\frac{d}{db} \\left( b^{m-1} \\right) \\frac{d}{db} \\left( b^m \\right) x^2 + \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (2)\n\\]\n\nthe general term of the expansion being\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{d}{db} \\right)^{r-1} \\left\\{ b^{r(n-1)} \\frac{d}{db} b^m \\right\\}_{1,2,\\ldots,r}, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (3)\n\\]\n\nwhich, on effecting the operations indicated, becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m \\left[ \\frac{m+r(n-1)}{n} - 1 \\right]^{r-1} \\frac{m-r}{n}}{n[r]^r} x^r, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (4)\n\\]\n\nWe see then that \\( u \\) is expanded in a series of the form\n\n\\[\nu_0 + u_1 x + u_2 x^2 + \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots ad inf.,\n\\]\n\nin which, since \\( b = 1 \\),\n\n\\[\nu_r = \\frac{m \\left[ \\frac{m+(n-1)r}{n} - 1 \\right]^{r-1} \\times (1)^{m-r}}{n[r]^r}; \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (5)\n\\]\n\nand this expression will represent the first term as well as the succeeding coefficients of the Lagrangian development, provided that we interpret the form \\([p]^0\\) by 1, and \\([p]^{-1}\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{p+1}\\).\n\nAs \\( 1^n \\) admits of \\( n \\) distinct values, the above development may be made to represent the \\( m \\)th power of any one of the \\( n \\) roots of the given algebraic equation. In particular,\nif we give to \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) the particular value 1, we have\n\n\\[\nu_r = \\frac{m \\left[ m + (n-1)r - 1 \\right]^{r-1}}{n[r]^r},\n\\]\n\nand the expansion then represents the \\( m \\)th power of that particular root which, when \\( x = 0 \\), reduces to 1. The law of the series upon which the formation of the differential equation depends is, as we shall perceive, independent of these determinations.\n\nChanging \\( r \\) into \\( r-n \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu_{r-n} = \\frac{m \\left[ m + (n-1)r - n \\right]^{r-n-1}}{n[r-n]^{r-n}} \\times 1^{\\frac{m-r+1}{n}},\n\\]\n\nwhence the law of the series is seen to be\n\n\\[\n[r]ru_r + \\left[ \\frac{m + (n-1)r - 1}{n} \\right]^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{r}{n} - \\frac{m}{n} - 1 \\right) u_{n-r} = 0, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (6)\n\\]\n\nand therefore, by what is shown in my memoir \"On a General Method in Analysis,\" the differential equation defining \\( u \\) will be\n\n\\[\n[D]^nu + \\left[ \\frac{m + (n-1)D - 1}{n} \\right]^{n-1} \\left( \\frac{D}{n} - \\frac{m}{n} - 1 \\right) e^{\\theta}u = 0, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (I)\n\\]\n\nin which \\( e^{\\theta} = x \\) and \\( D = \\frac{d}{dh} \\).\n\n3. As \\( u \\) may here represent the \\( m \\)th power of any of the roots of the given equation, it is evident that the general integral of the above differential equation will be\n\n\\[\nu = C_1y_1^m + C_2y_2^m \\ldots + C_ny_n^m, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (7)\n\\]\n\nexception arising, however, in the case in which for a particular value of \\( m \\) the \\( n \\) particular integrals \\( y_1^m, y_2^m, \\ldots y_n^m \\) cease to be independent. In such cases the above value of \\( u \\) constitutes an integral, but not the general integral of the differential equation.\n\nFor instance, if \\( m = -1 \\), and if we reduce the given algebraic equation to the form\n\n\\[\n(y^{-1})^n + xy^{-1} - 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nit is evident that, except when \\( n = 2 \\), we shall have\n\n\\[\ny_1^{-1} + y_2^{-1} \\ldots + y_n^{-1} = 0.\n\\]\n\nHere then\n\n\\[\nu = C_1y_1^{-1} + C_2y_2^{-1} \\ldots + C_ny_n^{-1}\n\\]\n\nmay be reduced to the form\n\n\\[\nu = (C_1 - C_n)y_1^{-1} + (C_2 - C_n)y_2^{-1} \\ldots + (C_{n-1} - C_n)y_{n-1}^{-1},\n\\]\n\nvirtually involving but \\( n-1 \\) arbitrary constants.\n\nSuch cases of failure may, however, be treated by giving to the integral a form which for the particular value of \\( m \\) shall become indeterminate, and then seeking the limiting\nDETERMINE THE FORM OF THE ROOTS OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS.\n\nvalue. In the above example we may write\n\n\\[ u = C_1 y_1^m + \\cdots + C_{n-1} y_{n-1}^m + C_n \\frac{y_1^m + y_2^m + \\cdots + y_n^m}{m+1}, \\]\n\nthe last term of which becomes a vanishing fraction when \\( m = -1 \\). The true limiting form is seen to be\n\n\\[ u = C_1 y_1^{-1} + \\cdots + C_{n-1} y_{n-1}^{-1} + C_n (y_1^{-1} \\log y_1 + \\cdots + y_n^{-1} \\log y_n). \\]  \n\nThis is the complete integral of (I.) when \\( m = -1 \\).\n\n4. The theory of these failing cases may be viewed also in another aspect. When\n\n\\[ u = C_1 y_1^m + C_2 y_2^m + \\cdots + C_n y_n^m \\]\n\nis an integral, but not the general integral of the differential equation (I), it must be the general integral of a differential equation involved in (I), but of a lower order. We may in fact conclude that such reduced differential equation will be deducible from the higher one by a process of integration. Let us apply this consideration to the foregoing example.\n\nWhen \\( m = -1 \\), the equation (I) becomes\n\n\\[ D(D-1)\\cdots(D-n+1)u + \\frac{1}{n} \\left[ \\frac{n-1}{n} D - \\frac{1}{n} - 1 \\right]^{n-1} (D-n+1)e^\\theta u = 0. \\]\n\nHence operating on both members with \\((D-n+1)^{-1}\\), we have\n\n\\[ D(D-1)\\cdots(D-n+2)u + \\frac{1}{n} \\left[ \\frac{n-1}{n} D - \\frac{1}{n} - 1 \\right]^{n-1} e^\\theta u = Ce^{(n-1)\\theta}. \\]\n\nIt must then be possible to determine \\( C \\) so as to cause this differential equation to be satisfied by (9). First let us seek to determine \\( C \\) so as to cause the equation to admit of any of the particular integrals \\( y_1^m, y_2^m, \\ldots, y_n^m \\). Substituting for \\( u \\) the Lagrangian expansion reduced by making \\( m = -1 \\), and giving to \\( b \\) any of the particular values included in the form \\( 1^n \\), we shall, on equating coefficients, find\n\n\\[ C = -\\frac{[n-3]^{n-2}}{n}, \\]\n\nwhence it appears that if \\( n \\) be greater than 2, \\( C = 0 \\). Thus the reduced differential equation becomes\n\n\\[ [D]^{n-1}u + \\frac{1}{n} \\left[ \\frac{n-1}{n} D - \\frac{1}{n} - 1 \\right]^{n-1} e^\\theta u = 0; \\]  \n\nand this, when \\( n \\) is greater than 2, is satisfied by\n\n\\[ u = C_1 y_1^{-1} + C_2 y_2^{-1} + \\cdots + C_n y_n^{-1}, \\]\n\nwhich in effect contains \\( n-1 \\) arbitrary constants, and so constitutes the complete integral of the differential equation.\n\nIf \\( n = 2 \\), the differential equation becomes\n\n\\[ Du + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} D - \\frac{3}{2} \\right) e^\\theta u = -\\frac{1}{2} e^\\theta, \\]\nwhich is satisfied by \\( u = y_1^{-1} \\) and by \\( u = y_2^{-1} \\), but, as is evident from its unhomogeneous form, not by \\( u = C_1 y_1^{-1} + C_2 y_2^{-1} \\). In this case, in fact, the condition \\( y_1^{-1} + y_2^{-1} = 0 \\) not being fulfilled, the primary differential equation (I) suffers no change in the form of its general solution.\n\nMr. Harley's results are in effect transformations of (10) and (11). Since \\( u = y^{-1} \\), it is seen that \\( u \\) will satisfy the algebraic equation\n\n\\[\nu^n + xu - 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nTransform this by assuming\n\n\\[\nx = -n(1-n)^{\\frac{1-n}{n}} x' \\frac{1-n}{n}, \\quad u = (1-n)^{\\frac{-1}{n}} x' \\frac{-1}{n} u',\n\\]\n\nand we have\n\n\\[\nu'^n - nu' + (n-1)x' = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is Mr. Harley's algebraic equation in form. Hence, if \\( x' = e^{\\theta'} \\) and \\( D' = \\frac{d}{d\\theta'} \\), we shall have\n\n\\[\ne^{\\theta} = -n(1-n)^{\\frac{1-n}{n}} e^{\\frac{1-n}{n} \\theta'}, \\quad u = (1-n)^{\\frac{-1}{n}} e^{\\frac{-1}{n} \\theta'} u', \\quad D = \\frac{n}{1-n} D'.\n\\]\n\nAnd (10) will become\n\n\\[\n\\left[ \\frac{nD'}{1-n} \\right]^{n-1} e^{\\frac{-1}{n} \\theta'} u' + \\frac{1}{n} \\left[ -D' - \\frac{1}{n} - 1 \\right]^{n-1} (-n)(1-n)^{1-n} e^{\\left(1-\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right) \\theta'} u' = 0.\n\\]\n\nMultiply by \\( e^{\\left(n-1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\theta'} \\), and we have\n\n\\[\n\\left[ \\frac{n(D'-n+1-\\frac{1}{n})}{1-n} \\right]^{n-1} e^{(n-1)\\theta'} u' - \\left[ -D'+n-2 \\right]^{n-1}(-n)^{n-1}(1-n)^{1-n} u' = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow\n\n\\[\n\\left[ \\frac{n(D'-n+1-\\frac{1}{n})}{1-n} \\right]^{n-1} = \\left[ \\frac{n}{1-n} D' + n - \\frac{1}{n} \\right]^{n-1} = (-1)^{n-1} \\left[ \\frac{n}{n-1} D' - \\frac{2n-1}{n-1} \\right]^{n-1},\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n[-D'+n-2]^{n-1} = (-1)^{n-1}[D']^{n-1}.\n\\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[\n\\left[ \\frac{n}{n-1} D' - \\frac{2n-1}{n-1} \\right]^{n-1} e^{(n-1)\\theta'} u' - \\left( \\frac{n}{n-1} \\right)^{n-1} [D']^{n-1} u' = 0,\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n[D']^{n-1} u' - \\left( \\frac{n-1}{n} \\right)^{n-1} \\left[ \\frac{n}{n-1} D' - \\frac{2n-1}{n-1} \\right]^{n-1} e^{(n-1)\\theta'} u' = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is Mr. Harley's equation (1), art. 1. When \\( n = 2 \\), we obtain from (11), by the same transformations, Mr. Harley's second equation (2), art. 1.\n\nNot only for the particular value \\( m = -1 \\), but apparently for all integer values of \\( m \\), the general differential equation (I) admits of one integration. It may be said that while the differential equation determining the form of the \\( m \\)th power of a root of the algebraic equation is in general of the \\( n \\)th order, this equation may, when \\( m \\) is an integer, be reduced to an equation of the \\( n-1 \\)th order; not, however, like the higher equation,\nunvarying in its type. I have thus verified some other particular forms obtained by Mr. Harley.\n\n**Solution of the Differential Equation by Definite Integrals.**\n\n5. On account of the difficulty of the investigation, I propose to employ two distinct methods leading to coincident results.\n\n**First Method.**—Operating on both sides of the given differential equation (I) with \\([\\text{[D]}^n]^{-1}\\), we have\n\n\\[\nu + \\frac{\\left[\\frac{n-1}{n} D + \\frac{m}{n-1}\\right]^{n-1} \\left(\\frac{D}{n} - \\frac{m}{n-1}\\right)}{\\text{[D]}^n} e^{\\theta u} = C_0 + C_1 e^\\theta + \\cdots + C_{n-1} e^{(n-1)\\theta},\n\\]\n\n\\(C_0, C_1, \\ldots C_{n-1}\\) being arbitrary constants.

The result may be expressed in the form\n\n\\[ \\sum_i C_i \\sum_j \\alpha_i^n \\alpha_j^{n-r} = -\\frac{m}{n\\pi} \\sum_r \\sin\\left(\\frac{r-m}{n}\\pi\\right) \\alpha_j^{n-r}, \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad (3) \\]\n\nthe summations with respect to \\( i \\) and \\( r \\) being both from 1 to \\( n \\) inclusive.\n\nBut\n\n\\[ \\sum_j \\alpha_i^n \\alpha_j^{n-r} = \\alpha_i^n \\alpha_j^{n-1} + \\alpha_i^n \\alpha_j^{n-2} \\ldots + \\alpha_i^n \\]\n\n\\[ = \\alpha_i (\\alpha_j^{n-1} + \\alpha_j^{n-2} \\ldots + \\alpha_j^{n-1}) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\alpha_i \\frac{\\alpha_j^n - \\alpha_i^n}{\\alpha_j - \\alpha_i}. \\]\n\nNow when \\( \\alpha_i \\) is not equal to \\( \\alpha_j \\), this expression vanishes, since \\( \\alpha_i^n = \\alpha_j^n = -1 \\). When, however, \\( \\alpha_i = \\alpha_j \\), the fraction \\( \\frac{\\alpha_j^n - \\alpha_i^n}{\\alpha_j - \\alpha_i} \\) becomes indeterminate, and its true limiting value is seen to be \\( n\\alpha_j^n = -n \\). Hence (3) becomes\n\n\\[ -nC_j = -\\frac{m}{n\\pi} \\sum_r \\sin\\left(\\frac{r-m}{n}\\pi\\right) \\alpha_j^{n-r}, \\]\n\n\\[ \\therefore \\quad C_j = \\frac{m}{n\\pi} \\sum_r \\sin\\left(\\frac{r-m}{n}\\pi\\right) \\alpha_j^{n-r}. \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad (4) \\]\n\nWe have thus solved the linear system of equations. We have still to reduce this solution by effecting the summation in the second member.\n\nNow to \\( \\alpha_j \\) we may give the form \\( e^{\\frac{2i+1}{n}\\pi\\sqrt{-1}} \\), which will represent all the \\( n \\)th roots of \\(-1\\) in succession if we give to \\( j \\) the series of values 1, 2, \\ldots n. Hence substituting for \\( \\alpha_j \\)\nthe above value, and giving to $\\sin \\left( \\frac{m-r}{n} \\pi \\right)$ its exponential form, we have\n\n$$\\sum_r \\sin \\left( \\frac{m-r}{n} \\pi \\right) \\alpha_j^{-r} = \\sum_r e^{\\frac{-2(j+1)r\\pi}{n}} - e^{\\frac{-(m-r)(j+1)\\pi}{n}} \\frac{2\\sqrt{-1}}{e^{\\frac{m\\pi}{n}} - e^{\\frac{-2j\\pi}{n}}}.$$  \n\nNow in general\n\n$$\\sum_r e^{k\\pi \\sqrt{-1}} = e^{k\\pi \\sqrt{-1}} + e^{2k\\pi \\sqrt{-1}} \\ldots + e^{nk\\pi \\sqrt{-1}}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{e^{(n+1)k\\pi \\sqrt{-1}} - e^{k\\pi \\sqrt{-1}}}{e^{k\\pi \\sqrt{-1}} - 1}$$\n\n$$= e^{\\frac{k(n+1)\\pi \\sqrt{-1}}{2}} \\times \\frac{e^{\\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\sqrt{-1}} - e^{\\frac{-k\\pi}{2} \\sqrt{-1}}}{e^{\\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\sqrt{-1}} - e^{\\frac{-k\\pi}{2} \\sqrt{-1}}}$$\n\n$$= e^{\\frac{k(n+1)\\pi \\sqrt{-1}}{2}} \\times \\frac{\\sin \\frac{k\\pi}{2}}{\\sin \\frac{k\\pi}{2}}.$$  \n\nPutting therefore $k = \\frac{-2(j+1)}{n}$,\n\nwe have\n\n$$\\sum_r e^{\\frac{-2(j+1)r\\pi}{n}} = e^{\\frac{-(j+1)(n+1)\\pi}{n}} \\frac{\\sin (j+1)\\pi}{\\sin \\frac{(j+1)\\pi}{n}},$$  \n\nand putting $k = e^{\\frac{-2j}{n}}$,\n\n$$\\sum_r e^{\\frac{-2jr\\pi}{n}} = e^{\\frac{-j(n+1)\\pi}{n}} \\frac{\\sin j\\pi}{\\sin \\frac{j\\pi}{n}}.$$  \n\nHence\n\n$$\\sum_r \\sin \\left( \\frac{m-r}{n} \\pi \\right) \\alpha_j^{-r} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-1}} \\begin{cases} e^{\\frac{m-(j+1)(n+1)\\pi}{n}} \\frac{\\sin (j+1)\\pi}{\\sin \\frac{(j+1)\\pi}{n}} \\\\ -e^{\\frac{-m-j(n+1)\\pi}{n}} \\frac{\\sin j\\pi}{\\sin \\frac{j\\pi}{n}} \\end{cases}$$  \n\nNow\n\n$$\\frac{\\sin (j+1)\\pi}{\\sin \\frac{(j+1)\\pi}{n}} = 0$$\n\nfor all values of $j$ taken from the series $1, 2, \\ldots n$ except the value $n-1$, for which the expression becomes indeterminate in form, and has for its true value\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi \\cos n\\pi}{n \\cos \\frac{n\\pi}{n}} = \\frac{n \\cos n\\pi}{\\cos \\pi} = \\pm n,$$\n\nas $n$ is odd or even.\nSo too\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\sin j\\pi}{\\sin \\frac{j\\pi}{n}} = 0 \\]\n\nfor all values of \\( j \\) taken from the series 1, 2, . . \\( n \\) except the value \\( n \\), for which its true value is\n\n\\[ \\frac{n \\cos n\\pi}{\\cos \\pi} = \\pm n \\]\n\nas \\( n \\) is odd or even.\n\nHence when \\( j \\) stands for any of the integers 1, 2, . . \\( n-2 \\), we have\n\n\\[ \\Sigma_r \\sin \\left( \\frac{m-r}{n} \\pi \\right) \\alpha_j^{-r} = 0. \\]\n\nWhen \\( j=n-1 \\), we have\n\n\\[ \\Sigma_r \\sin \\left( \\frac{m-r}{n} \\pi \\right) \\alpha_j^{-r} = \\pm \\frac{n}{2\\sqrt{-1}} e^{\\frac{m-n(n+1)}{n}\\pi\\sqrt{-1}}, \\]\n\nthe upper or lower sign being taken according as \\( n \\) is odd or even.
