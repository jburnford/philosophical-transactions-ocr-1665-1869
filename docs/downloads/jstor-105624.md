XLVII. Extract from a Paper of Mons. De la Lande, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, to Mr. Gael Morris, of the Transit of Venus, on the 6th June 1761, observed at Tobolsk in Siberia, by M. Chappe.

Read Feb. 25, 1762.

End of the eclipse of the sun, 2d June 1761, Apparent time, h m s
Internal contact of Venus with the sun's limb at ingress, 5th June 19 0 28
Internal contact at the egress, 6th June 0 49 20½
External contact at the egress 1 7 39½

These observations were taken with a refracting telescope of 19 Paris feet focal length, with an eyeglass of 3 inches focus.

The least distance of the southern limb of Venus from the nearest limb of the sun, was measured by a micrometer fitted to a 10 feet telescope, and found to be = 6' 2'', and the sun's diameter was = 31' 37''.
