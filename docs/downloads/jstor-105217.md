in respect to one of them. Those, which I have opened, are philosophical tracts, the subjects of which are known to me; but I am not at liberty to be more explicit. When they are published, they shall be immediately conveyed to you. The first papyri, of which I formerly acquainted you, were in a separate room, adjoining to the before-mentioned palace.

CIII. Extract of a Letter from Sir James Gray, Bart. his Majesty's Envoy to the King of Naples, to the Right Honourable Sir Thomas Robinson, Knight of the Bath, one of his Majesty's Secretaries of State, relating to the same Discoveries at Herculaneum.

Naples, October 29, 1754.

They have lately met with more rolls of Papyri of different lengths and sizes, some with the Umbilicus remaining in them; the greater part are Greek in small capitals. The Canonico Mazocchi, who is much esteemed for his learning and knowledge of antiquity, is employed in copying and explaining five entire columns, that have been lately unrolled off one of the Papyri, which gives some hopes of farther discoveries. This manuscript treats of music and poetry. The Epicurean philosophy

Last week were found two fine bronze heads, of excellent workmanship, one of Seneca, and another of a captive king. The king spares no expense in recovering and preserving these valuable remains. In order to satisfy the curiosity of the public, he has ordered a catalogue to be printed, with some designs of the principal statues and paintings, which will be published soon. A more exact account of these discoveries will some time or other be given by Monsignor Baiardi, who, in three large quarto volumes already printed, has not finished his introduction.
