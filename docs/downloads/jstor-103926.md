VI. An Account of the Wound, which the late Lord Carpenter received at Brihuega; whereby a Bullet remained near his Gullet for a Year wanting a few Days; communicated to the Royal Society by his Son the Right Honourable George Lord Carpenter, F. R. S. &c.

Lord Carpenter was wounded at the Defence of the Breach of Brihuega in Spain, in the Mouth by a small Spanish Musket-ball, which having taken away Part of his upper Lip, beat out all his Teeth (except two) on one Side, broke and splinter'd part of his upper Jaw-bone, went through his Tongue, and lodged itself near his Gullet, where it remained fifty-one Weeks and three Days before it was extracted, the Chirurgeons thinking it had been spit out with some of his Teeth soon after his being wounded. The Ledge which was made upon the Bullet by the two
two Fore Teeth, lying almost by the Gullet, and continually grating upon it, occasion'd an intolerable Pain, and preventing him from swallowing any thing but Liquids, it brought him so low, that his Life being despair'd of, to make a final Trial, his Tongue was drawn out as far as it could be, and one of the Chirurgeons feeling the Ball with his Probe, which he then took to be a Piece of a Tooth, (several Pieces of Teeth having been beat into his Tongue by the Bullet) and endeavouring to extract it, he took hold of the Ledge with his Forceps, and pulled the Ball out, after which he recover'd in a few Weeks.

The Marks of the Fore Teeth are to be seen on the Bullet, and where it flatted upon the Jaw-bone.

N.B. A very extraordinary Narrative of a Gun-shot Wound, is to be seen in № 320. of these Transactions: It is the Case of one Dr. Feilding, who was shot in near the Eye, and after 29 Years the Bullet was cut out near the Pomum Adami.
