The Extremes they there made me on, as the Author Observes, had like to have cost them all that they had in the Indies; and was the greatest cause of the War between the Portuguez and the Indians. There are several Remarkable Passages of the Jesuites Contrivances, and the Indians Resentment thereof, for which I refer to the Book, as less proper to our Design. The Author shews the Doctrines wherein the Church of Malabar agrees with that of England, and differs from the Roman. And concludes with the Acts and Decrees of the Synod of Diamper, with the occasion of its being called; which, with a Preface to a Missal imposed upon that Church by the Arch-Bishop Menezes, ends the whole Book.
