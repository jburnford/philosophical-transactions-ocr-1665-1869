III.\n\nIn the Month of June 1684, I was called to see Madam —— who had a Polypus in the right Nostril; after I had examin'd the marks of it which were to be soft, white, and without pain; I endeavour'd to pull it out, which I did without pain or any bad accident. But after this Extraction, she still felt some trouble in her Nose, and moisture did pass with difficulty from the Nose to the Throat. This engaged me, seeing no more in the Nostrils to look into the Mouth, where I perceived behind the Vvula, a strange body of the bigness of half a Nut, which I judged to be a portion of the same Polypus. In view of this I determin'd to draw it out, being encouraged by the advice of Monsieur Fede, curious both in Physick and Philosophy, and of Monsieur Vary a most expert Surgeon. Having pulled it out in their presence, we found it of an extraordinary shape; the Piece by which I laid hold of it was hard, and of a dark brown; it was fastned by two Branches, which seem'd to have taken their shape in the Nose, being each of them as big as a sweet Almond; their substance was softer, and whiter. Besides these three parts, it had a little stalk something red, of the bigness of a Cherry-stalk: There was not a drop of Blood spilt, and the Patient felt no pain in the Operation; all trouble was removed, and the liquor passed easily.\n\nIn all this there is nothing extraordinary for many Practitioners might have met with the like. At the end of two Years the Patient died of a malignant Fever; and\nand forasmuch as sometime before her Death, she complained of a new trouble in her Nose. I earnestly desired leave of the Family to open this Organ, which was granted me; I did it in the presence of the same Persons I have named. Being desirous to find the original of this Polypus, we broke the Bone to omit nothing; after we had broke all, we found nothing in all the Nose, but a little piece of Flesh very soft, which came out of a cleft of the Processus Pterygoides; we follow'd it exactly, which brought us into the Sinus of the upper Jaw; we broke this Bone also, and perceiv'd in this Sinus a ropy and clear humour, in the middle of which there was a body like in figure consistence and colour to a greater one, which we had before taken out; we took notice also of a little red speck, which seem'd to be the root of this Polypus.\n\nThe Polypus's are spungy excrescencies, which according to Authors are form'd upon the Membrane that covers the Noses within, by some alteration made there; some are form'd also in other parts, as in the Cavities of the great Veins. But this Membrane is more dispos'd to the production of them than others, because it is the most spongy of the whole Body, and most full of Blood Vessels.\n\nThe Discovery of Mr. Giles, gives us to understand, that it may be produc'd in the Sinus, over which this Membrane is extended, and into which it filters the Snot which is spread over this Organe, and for this reason probably 'tis that 'tis so difficult radically to cure these Polypus's.\n\nMoreover the extirpation of them is not always so successful as it has been in this; when they appear very red and full of Blood, the Extirpation of them is dangerous, for fear of an Hemorrhagie, which is not easily stopt. Therefore some do use Caustick Waters, and that\nthat with better Success; some have been recovered, as Schenkius says, by the use of a Remedy prepared thus, Take an ordinary Bucket with 6 or 7 Holes in the bottom, upon which lay the thickness of four Fingers broad in Quick-Lime, upon which lay as much Ashes of Oak, continue this Stratification till only four Fingers be left a top, which is filled with Water, that passes through all the Beds, to fall into a Vessel under the Bucket, pour this three or four times upon these Beds, then leave it on the Fire till it thicken like a Gelly. This Matter is preserv'd in Bottles well stopp'd, of which one may take the bigness of a Bean in a little Leaden-Spoon, which must be thrust into the Nose, so that the Matter do not touch any thing but the Carnosity, upon which it must remain near an Hour. After 'tis taken off, they apply Butter to take off the Eschar; this Remedy is repeated 'till the Excrescence be entirely consum'd.
