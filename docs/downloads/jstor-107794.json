By James South, Esq. F.R.S.\n\nRead November 17, 1825.\n\nThe Royal Society having honoured the observations of 380 double and triple stars made by Mr. Herschel and myself with a place in the Philosophical Transactions, I am induced to offer for the like distinction a fresh series.\n\nThe Equatorial Instruments and Micrometers used on the present occasion, being precisely the same as those with which the preceding observations were made, the prefatory matter attached to the former communication, will be generally applicable to this.\n\nAs however some of the results have been obtained in England, and others in France, the place where each series of measures was procured, accompanies the date and instrument of observation.\n\nFrom the 3rd of April, 1825, to the demolition of the Observatory at Passy, the micrometer of the Five-feet Equatorial was applied to the Seven-feet Instrument, in order to MDCCCXXVI.\nMr. South's observations of the apparent distances\n\nobtain the advantage of higher magnifying powers. By this change they stand in order 92, 157, 181, 327, 413, 513, and 787; the commonly used power being 181: a rigorous examination assured me, that the value of the one micrometer, was also the value of the other.\n\nIn the subsequent pages will be found observations of about 160 double and triple stars, hitherto (as far as I know) undiscovered: their apparent right ascensions and declinations are, I hope, generally accurate to the nearest minute: and should occasionally a greater error be detected, some indulgence will I trust be extended to me, for they were generally found at a considerable distance from the meridian, when extreme unsteadiness of the stars, and unwillingness to quit my observatory, rendered sweeping for new double stars my only mode of passing the night in it: as however they have been found on subsequent evenings from the data here given, no difficulty in identifying them, can reasonably be expected.\n\nIn the former Paper, 37 double and triple stars were selected as entitled to peculiar notice, these it was my intention to have subjected individually to a rigid investigation; owing however to the almost unprecedented bad weather of the last autumnal and winter months, 30 only of them could be re-measured; and the observations, which are here subjoined as an Appendix, although not so complete* as I could have wished, will still I hope be deemed not unimportant.\n\nThe arrangement is somewhat different from that pursued on the former occasion: instead of individual measures being\n\n* The Appendix contains observations of thirty-six stars; six however of them offer no particular interest, and were measured inadvertently, under an idea that they were un-measured stars.\npresented to public view, the mean result of each night's work is here noted; but as the number of observations, and the differences between the extreme measures of each series are also specified, it is hoped that the alteration will be satisfactory to the Society.\n\nAs in these observations I have not had the powerful aid of Mr. Herschel, it has been my endeavour as far as possible to compensate for the loss; hence, instead of taking ten individual observations both of distance and position on the same night, and thereby considering the star measured, I have divided the work generally assigned to each star between two evenings, the better to correct any error which unfavourable state of atmosphere, inaccurate micrometrical readings, or particular bias of judgment might entail; and when the results have exhibited discordances greater than seemed justified by the difficulty of the observations, a third, or even a fourth night's determination has been found useful.\n\nTo the observations contained in the former Memoir, peculiar interest was attached by the comparison of them with the results obtained by other astronomers; of which by far the most important were those derived from the labours of Sir W. Herschel; but as the observations which are recorded in the Philosophical Transactions are (from circumstances before * adverted to) of themselves inadequate to furnish the final results arrived at by that illustrious astronomer, it is grateful to me, and doubtless will also be to the Society, that the kindness of Mr. Herschel has supplied the necessary information; thus the existence of fresh connected systems is substantiated, and a degree of present importance conferred on the following pages, which he alone could bestow.\n\n* See Phil. Trans. for 1824, Part III. page 20.\nMr. South's observations of the apparent distances\n\nThe noble liberality of the Russian Government having recently put Mr. Struve in possession of an instrument much more powerful, and far more appropriate, for pursuing this department of astronomical* enquiry, than those with which his published observations were made, I have not deemed it right, as heretofore, to refer to his earlier, yet still valuable determinations, the general accuracy of which may well be cited as proofs of what industry and perseverance may achieve, although supported by comparatively slender instrumental assistance.\n\nI have said that the accompanying observations were made partly at home, and partly abroad; the latter remind me of a pleasing duty:—the Board of Longitude of Paris, and Government of France, have claims upon me too great to remain unnoticed, the one for having requested, and the other for having acceded to me the permission of introducing into France, free of all duty (sans conditions), whatever astronomical instruments I thought proper;† and so effectual were the arrangements of the Director General of the\n\n* The investigation of parallax by direct observations of double stars, not having yet been seriously entered upon, although recommended by Sir W. Herschel nearly fifty years ago, and the importance of it having been warmly pressed upon me by Monsieur le Marquis de la Place—a continuous series of observations of the most interesting double and triple stars seeming necessary—and fresh determinations of the orbits of Saturn's satellites being wanted—it was my wish to have procured more extensive means than I possess, to have attacked the one, to have with greater facility followed up the other, and to have furnished the necessary observations of the satellites alluded to;—the overtures however for an object-glass of twelve inches diameter, and twenty feet focal length (Paris measure), with which I had proposed to construct an equatorial, similar to that of which an engraving is given in the former paper, were most unexpectedly arrested in limine, by Mr. Fraunhofer declining to supply me with one, unless accompanied by apparatus provided by himself—a useless augmentation of expense, which prudence therefore did not authorize me, to incur.\n\n† The like indulgence was granted me for the importation of my ordinary baggage, travelling carriage, and for whatever I deemed necessary to render my sojourn in France comfortable.\nDouanes, Mons. le Marquis de Vaulchier, and so extreme the politeness of the principal and subordinate officers of the Customs at Calais, that the importation and exportation of them, were affairs, not of difficulty, but of gratification.\n\nIt is needless to state, that on the establishment of an observatory by a private individual in a foreign country, many difficulties must be encountered. To Mons. Benjamin Delessert, whose liberality in promoting every thing which has science for its aim knows no bounds, I stand indebted, amongst other things, for whatever comfort my observatory afforded.\n\nFrom the members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris I uniformly received every possible attention, whilst to Messrs. De la Place, Arago, Bouvard, Humboldt, and Poisson, a residence of fifteen months has placed me under obligations of no common order: they were received with pride, and are remembered with gratitude.\n\nThe Society have now before them, with few exceptions, a re-examination of all the identified double and triple stars described by Sir W. Herschel in the Philosophical Transactions; with the sentiments therefore of the illustrious author of the Mécanique Céleste I will conclude—\"Had the labours of Sir W. Herschel been confined to this department of astronomy, the discoveries he has made in it would have alone conferred upon him an imperishable name.\"\n\nJAMES SOUTH.\n\nPassy; Rue Franklin, No. 19,\nOct. 22, 1825.\nMr. South's observations of the apparent distances\n\nNo. CCCLXXXI.

The cause probably lies in the construction of the micrometer used;* and its effect is to throw a great uncertainty on the earlier distances of all stars of the 5th and 6th classes.

Night foggy.\n\nBetween this night and the 22nd of October, when the observatory at Passy was broken up, unfavourableness of the weather prevented me getting a second series of observations.\n\naxis; the cones however of the horizontal axis being firmly soldered and pinned to a shoulder projecting from the centre-piece, are not separable from it: the level of the axis is supplied with a silver scale, each division of which is equivalent to one second. In the focus of the object-glass are seven equi-distant wires, the equatorial interval between any two of them being about 20 seconds of time: on each side of the meridian wire, and at equal distances from it, are two others, so placed that the pole star shall pass from it to either of them in two minutes, for a purpose explained in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society (vide Vol. I. page 238); applicable to each side plate, is an apparatus for regulating the quantity of light projected from the lamp upon the wires. The side plates are similar to those belonging to my Four-feet Transit Circle, and which (I believe) were described in Rees's Encyclopaedia, when the instrument was the property of Mr. Groombridge. A second level for the horizontal axis, a spare one for the altitude circle, and a second wire-plate furnished with spiders' lines are at hand, and are ready for immediate use, should accident sustained by any of the first set, render them unfit for service—a reserve which no traveller should neglect; lest also any of the screws by which the various parts of the instrument are connected should be lost, a few additional ones placed in the box are not, (as I have found by experience), without their use.\n\nThe object-glass was made by Mr. Tullery, and originally belonged to the Westbury Circle: its clear aperture is 2.7 inches, its focal length is 43 inches; with a magnifying power of 300 it defines $\\alpha$ Lyrae, Arcturus and Aldebaran, perfectly sharp and round; separates very distinctly the close stars of $\\gamma$ Leonis, $\\alpha$ Bootis, and $\\zeta$ Orionis; whilst with 150 (the commonly used power) under favourable circumstances, the small star south preceding Polaris, is sufficiently visible to enable the observer to take its transit, with considerable precision.\n\nThe instrument is mounted on stone piers, and has retained its meridian position extremely well; fifteen months' experience has shown, that whilst the maximum error, to which the mean of a single series of observations of any star south of the zenith of my observatory, does not exceed 4-tenths of a second, often, very often, the result of a single set will not deviate 2-tenths from the true right ascension. When the pole star is steady, its transit over the wire may be determined to one second. Thus much for its utility.\n\nAs for its portability: the transverse axis, the telescope tubes, and the altitude circle, are included in a box 29 inches long, 14 inches broad, and 6$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches deep. The three levels, the spare wire-plate, the light regulating apparatus, the lamp, &c. are lodged in a case 27$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in length, 11$\\frac{1}{2}$ in breadth, and 3$\\frac{1}{2}$ in depth. The side plates, with their appendages of nuts, screws, &c. are contained in a box 13$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, 7$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches broad, and 7$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches deep; and the tout ensemble is well accommodated under the seat of my travelling carriage.

Twenty stars have been observed, amongst them several of the most difficult, and some which I have never before seen double. Now however the dew is not confined to the parts of the telescope in the neighbourhood of the object-glass, but has attacked the wires of the micrometer; they have a serrated appearance; and I suspect begin to \"fiddle.\" Prudence advises me to relinquish observing, lest by persevering they should become broken. Many nights since my abode here, the dew has been far more copious, than I ever observed it to be in England; frequently the water has dripped off the instrument for several successive hours, but I never had any reason to suspect the slightest precipitation of moisture on the micrometer wires.

In 1783 it is described as having the interval of the discs only $\\frac{1}{4}$ diameter of the large star, which, for a star of the 8th magnitude, could hardly correspond to more than $4''$ from centre to centre. The angles, it is true, agree—that given by Sir W. Herschel in 1783 being $60°\\ 48' np$, differing only $2'$ from its present value. This star requires further observation.

In PIAZZI's catalogue, a proper motion of $-0''.03$ in R. A. and $+0''.18$ in declination is ascribed to the large star.

Sir W. HERSCHEL's measures are as follows:—1781.80 (Oct. 22) Pos. $11^\\circ 39' nf$, Dist. $19''.533$. Thus in 43.46 years no less an arc than $-36^\\circ 24'$ has been described, being at the rate of $-0''.838$ per annum, and a change of distance to the amount of $+6''.707$, or $+0''.154$ per annum.\n\nAn observation in a 20-feet sweep in 1785 confirms the fact of the angle made by the two stars being then small. \"δ Equulei, double, very unequal, a few degrees nf. S.r.\"\nNo. D CCLXXXII. continued.\n\nThe star is a remarkable one; and from its magnitude and situation in the heavens, not to be confounded with any other.\n\nThe proper motions assigned to this star in Piazzi's Catalogue, account satisfactorily for the change observed. They are respectively $+0''.08$ in R.A. and $-0''.29$ in declination. These motions, in 44 years, would carry the large star $3''.5$ to the following, and $12''.8$ to the south side of its place in 1781, or, in a direction, making an angle of $74^\\circ sf$ with the parallel. Supposing then the small star fixed, the present angle of position and distance should be $47^\\circ nf$ and $22''.5$ instead of $48^\\circ 3'$ and $26''.24$ which observation makes them. If we consider the uncertainty which necessarily hangs about the earlier distance, depending as it does on a single measure, and from the extreme minuteness of the small star, liable easily to an error of 2 or 3'', it will be allowed that a more satisfactory verification of the proper motion of the one star, and the comparative fixity of the other, could hardly have been looked for. This, among other similar instances, will serve to show the advantage which may be taken of the measures of double stars in all researches relating to the proper motions of the stars. This star appears to be a fit object for the investigation of parallax. (H.)\n\nNo. DCCLXXXIII. R.A. $21^h 7^m$; Decl. $8^\\circ 23' S.$\n\nStruve, 716; Hist.

Hence it appears that the small star has continued its motion in the direction there assigned to it; and, if we may confide sufficiently in both data, with an accelerated velocity, for the computed motion corresponding to an interval of 2.0 years would be \\(-1°.148\\), whereas the observations make it \\(-4° 18'\\) or \\(-4°.3\\). Meanwhile the direction of the motion is as predicted, and we may therefore regard the reality of this star's rotation as fully confirmed.

To begin with the two nearer stars A and B. Sir W. Herschel's measure of their position Nov. 28, 1781 ($1781.90$) was $86^\\circ\\ 32'\\ n.f.$ and it will be remarked, that a position so nearly perpendicular to the diurnal motion carries in some measure its own verification with it, as not liable to gross error. This differs no less than $54^\\circ\\ 22'$ from the present angle in the same quadrant, giving a mean annual motion of $+1^\\circ.254$ or direct ($n.f\\ s.p$).

Herschel, no measures could be procured, which is much to be regretted.\n\nThe evidence for the motion of the more distant star C will be found in the Philosophical Transactions, 1824, Part III. p. 115. The change of quadrant—the great amount of the motion ($23^\\circ\\ 42'$ in $40\\frac{1}{4}$ years) and the circumstance of an error to that amount, or anything like it, being perfectly impossible from the considerable distance of the stars; add, too, the regular gradations by which the change appears, from several intervening observations, to have taken place; all these considerations place the motion of the distant star beyond dispute, and the present measures confirm it, the angle $67^\\circ\\ 55'\\ sf$ compared with that of $1822\\ (68^\\circ\\ 17'\\ sf)$ indicating a motion still in the same direction. Its amount, it is true, is only $-22'$ instead of $-1^\\circ\\ 44'$ which the assigned velocity would give, but this is as near a coincidence as we have a right to expect in such small quantities.\n\nIf this be really a Ternary system connected by the mutual attraction of its parts, its perturbations will present one of the most intricate problems in physical astronomy. The difficulty will not be diminished by the circumstance of the rotations of the two small stars about the large one being (apparently at least) performed in opposite directions, being the reverse of what obtains in our planetary system, or by that of the deviations of the relative angular velocities from Kepler's law, being such as to indicate either great masses in all the three bodies, great eccentricities in their orbits, or a different law of gravity from what obtains in our system.

The sudden diminution of velocity is however not confirmed. Indeed it rested on too short an interval, and on too few observations (for such very close stars) to deserve great confidence. We cannot do better than recommend this star for the next 10 or 20 years to the constant and careful measurement of astronomers; nor can we too strongly inculcate here the indispensable necessity of multiplying extremely their measures of position, to eliminate those errors of judgment to which the most experienced observers are liable in measures of this sort. This done, there is no doubt of our arriving at a precise knowledge of the elements and position of the orbit described by each about their common centre of gravity; and the question of the extension or non-extension of the Newtonian law of gravity to the sidereal heavens—the next great step which physical astronomy has yet to make—will be effectually decided.

The present observations, then, go a great way towards deciding this interesting question, as, so far from indicating any retardation, their tendency lies the other way. In fact, (supposing them free from error), no less than — $3^\\circ\\ 54'$ have been described in 2.74 years, being at the rate of — $1^\\circ.420$ per annum.

This evening the stars being more tranquil, a power of 327 was applied, and an elongation of the large star was at times suspected: 413 confirmed the suspicion, but was inadequate to separate the two stars. The angles here given were obtained with 513, with which the discs of the stars seemed in contact; but their extreme unsteadiness under this magnifying power rendered all attempts to procure measures of distance abortive; and the position, from this circumstance, must be regarded with some distrust.

Now this is the very angle which, according to the table (p. 252, Phil. Trans. 1824.

By this mode of observing we have two chances of detecting proper motion, each of which will afford a verification of the other; for suppose the star A of 36 Ophiuchi to have a motion toward the south, say at the rate of one second per annum, then will the difference of declination between it and the star C to the north of it, be increased annually by one second; but that which increased the difference of declination between these two stars, should diminish the difference of declination between A of 36, and A of 38 Ophiuchi; and if our observations be correct, the increase of difference on the one hand, should be exactly equal to the decrease of it, on the other; and vice versa, should the proper motion of A of 36, carry it toward the north.\n\nSecondly, in Right Ascension.\n\nSuppose the proper motion of A of 36 to be toward the west annually one second, the result will be, to lessen the difference of right ascension of it, and of the preceding star C, and at the same time to augment the difference of right ascension between A of 36, and A of 38; and, as before, the decrease in the one instance, should be equalled by the increase in the other; and if the proper motion of A of 36, take an easterly direction, it will be detected by consequences opposite to those just described, but offering similar verifications.\nand positions of 36 double and triple stars, &c.\n\nNo. XXIV.

A. of 30 Scorpii, nor have I found any observation of 38 Ophiuchi, in the manuscript\ntransits of both stars; Piazzi however, by a comparison of his own observations with those of preceding astronomers, assigns to them quantities, which for 1825.57 would give difference of R. A. (in time) $52''.50$, agreeing with our determination to 9-hundredths of a second; hence also in R. A. as well as in declination, they have, if any, the same proper motion.\n\nIf however the proper motions attributed to them be correct, and if none be enjoyed by A of 38 Ophiuchi, the difference of declination between 36 and 38 should be $5' 23''.073$, differing not one second from our determination: and if the proper motion in right ascension attributed to 36 be correct (the star 38 being fixed), the difference of R. A. (in time) between them should be $2' 11''.76$ only fourteen hundredths of a second, at variance with our observations; quantities which may be very fairly attributed to errors of observation.\n\nHence it follows, that the two stars 36 Ophiuchi and 30 Scorpii, although distant from each other more than 12 minutes, are journeying together through space; and that the annual proper motions ($1''.0756$ and $1''.1155$ toward the south, and $0''.59$ and $0''.58$ toward the west), assigned to them, are true.\n\nFrom the above investigation we also learn, that the star 38 Ophiuchi has no sensible proper motion; consequently the observed increase of distance between it and the small star,* if it exist, must probably be sought for, in some peculiarity of the latter.\n\n* Referred to in page 209.\nMr. South's re-examination of the apparent distances\n\nNo. XXV.

The last determination, considering the great number of measures it rests upon, may be regarded as entitled to great confidence, in spite of the discordant results of April 3 and May 3, 1825, which, however, whether rejected or retained, make little difference in the final mean.

But as it is inconsistent with the laws of central forces that this should take place without a corresponding increase of distance (for the angular velocity is inversely as the square of the distance in the apparent as well as in the real orbit, whatever be its position with regard to the line of sight), it becomes necessary to examine more minutely into the distances at the different epochs. It will be observed, however, that in all the interval from 1781 to 1819 we find no measure of the distance, and that the maximum of angular velocity must have taken place somewhere in this interval. (See Phil. Trans. 1824. iii. p. 290-291.) In such a case we must recur to estimations in diameters, though necessarily less to be depended on than positive measures. On re-examining Sir W. Herschel's MSS., we fortunately find the following observations, which throw considerable light on this point, and in some measure supply the deficiency of measures. It will be recollected that his measures of distance are always supposed to include both diameters of the stars measured.\n\n\"October 27, 1779. $3''.593$.

Excessively difficult.\n\nThe small star only visible by glimpses; observations made on the meridian, with 787; the extreme unsteadiness of the stars renders it impossible to procure any measures of distance, and those of position must be received with caution.\n\nThe unfavourableness of the weather has not allowed me to procure other measures of this difficult star. Sloane-street, March 18, 1826.\n\nThe position April 4, 1783, was measured with a 20-feet reflector, 12 inches aperture, and found to be $20^\\circ\\ 54'\\ s.f.$ The change is very great, no less than $43^\\circ\\ 20'$ in 42.8 years, or almost precisely a degree per annum. There can be little doubt, therefore, that this very curious double star is entitled to a place among the revolving stars or Binary systems. The uncertainty of the present observations, arising from the difficulty of the star, and the unfavourable weather, might render us cautious in admitting this conclusion; but a series of well-agreeing measures by Mr. Struve, on four nights, from Feb. 25, to April 4, 1825, which give a mean result $63^\\circ.7\\ s.f.$ sufficiently establish the fact. These interesting observations are contained in a letter from Mr. Struve, dated April 21, 1825.
