Mr. Buckley, chief Surgeon at Fort St. George in the East-Indies, having lately presented the Royal Society with a China Cabinet, full of the Instruments and Simples used by their Surgeons, &c. amongst which, several are new and of different Shapes from the same used in Europe, they have commanded me some Account should be given of them.

The Razors were of Two Sorts, either such as are represented to the natural Bignels, Fig. 1. and resemble some Sorts of Knives, and do not fold in; or

Fig. 2.
Fig. 2, and 3. which represent another sort of Razors, which are longer, and fold in after the manner expressed in the Figures. They were daubed over with a Substance resembling Diachylum Plaster, to keep them from Rust; which it had effectually done, through different Climates.

Fig. 4. and 5. represent an Incision Knife used in China, the whole being of Brass, excepting towards their Point aa, which is of Steel.

The most unusual Instruments that came over in this Cabinet were, those contrived for the taking any Substance out of the Ears, or for the scratching or tickling them, which the Chinese do account one of the greatest Pleasures.

Fig. 6. Does represent one of these Instruments which is a small Pearl, such as is used in Necklaces, through the Bore of which is put and fasten'd a Hog's Bristle, the other End of the Bristle being fast in a Tortoise-Shell-Handle.

Fig. 7. Represents an other Instrument for the Ears, made of small Silver Wire twisted, set into a Tortoise-Shell-Handle, the Wire being made into a round Loop at the End.

Fig. 8. Shows an Ear Instrument made of a piece of large Silver Wire, flatted at end, and set in a piece of Tortoise-Shell.

Fig. 9. Is an Ear Instrument made likewise of Silver-Wire, set in a Tortoise-Shell-Handle, the End of the Wire being made sharp, and shap'd like an Hook:

Fig. 10. Represents an Ear Instrument, very much resembling our common European Ear-pickers, being of Silver set in Tortoise-Shell.

Fig. 11.
Fig. 11. Shews the Figure of an Ear Instrument made of several Hogs Bristles, let as in a common Pencil.

Fig. 12. Represents Instruments made of very fine Downy Feathers tyed together like a Pencil, or Brush on the end of a Tortoise Shell Handle.

Fig. 13. Shows an Instrument exactly like that figured Fig. 8. only the flat end has a slit through it.

Fig. 14. Is a Chinese Figure, wherein is represented one of that Nation, using one of these Instruments, and expressing great Satisfaction therein. This I had of William Charleton, Esq; who favoured the Royal Society with a Sight of it at one of their Meetings.

Whatever Pleasure the Chinese may take in thus picking their Ears, I am certain most People in these parts who have their hearing impaired and have advised with me for their Help, I have found have had such Misfortunes first come to them by picking their Ears too much, and thereby bringing Humours, or ulcerous Dispositions in them.
