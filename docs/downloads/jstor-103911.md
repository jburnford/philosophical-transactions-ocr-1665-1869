VIII. *A Letter from the Revd Ebenezer 
Latham, M.D. and V.D.M. to C. 
Mortimer, M.D. Sec. R. S. containing a 
Proposal to make the Poles of a Globe of 
the Heavens move in a Circle round the 
Poles of the Ecliptic; read at a Meeting 
of the Royal Society, April 17. 1738.*

S I R,

Findern, April 14, 38.

I take the Liberty through your Hands to commu-
nicate the inclosed to the Royal Society, and at 
the same time to submit to that learned Body a Pro-
posal
posal I would make relating to an Improvement in
the Construction of the Globes of the Heavens. As
we now have them, you know they are only form'd
for the present Age, and do not serve the Purposes of
Chronology and History, as they might, if the Poles
whereon they turn were contriv'd to move in a Circle
round those of the Ecliptic, according to the present
Obliquity of this. By this Means we might have a
View of the Heavens suited to every Period, and that
would answer the antient Descriptions, those of Eu-
doxus, for Instance, who is supposed to borrow his
from the most early Observations; and of Hipparchus,
&c. Nor could any Contrivance better enable the
lowest Reader to judge of the Merits of the Contro-
versy about the Argonautic Expedition, as far as it
depends on this: For it will verify to the Sight the
Path of the Colures, &c. at any Time. I thought to
have transmitted a Scheme of the whole, in which
the Equator must be fix'd to the brazen Meridian, &c.
But it is easily understood, and can only wait the Ap-
probation of such great Judges to recommend it to
the Artists.

Your most obedient,

Humble Servant,

E. Latham.

N. B. That Globes, to answer the End here proposed,
tho' differently constructed, had long before been made and
published by Mr. Senex, who at next Meeting gave the fol-
lowing Account of his Contrivance.
