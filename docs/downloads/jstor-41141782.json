Communicated January 12, 1826.\n\nThe daily variation of the horizontal needle is a subject which has, for nearly a century, attracted the attention of several accurate observers, whose object was principally limited to determining the hour of the day, when its amount was the greatest, and the times of the needle's successive easterly and westerly motions.\n\nFrom these observations, however, it could not be ascertained whether the cause of this daily variation proceeded from an actual change in the direction of the magnetic axis of the earth, or whether it arose from some foreign force, acting transversely on the needle, impelling it out of its natural direction. To submit this question to the test of observation, Mr. Barlow, in 1823, undertook a set of experiments on the daily variation of a horizontal needle nearly neutralized by the application of artificial magnets; under an idea, that if the daily variation proceeded from an actual change in the direction of the earth's magnetism, the needle in this case, as when in its natural state, would merely take up its new direction without any increase of amount; but if it proceeded from a foreign force acting transversely upon it, the needle now having less intensity of direction than when in its natural state, it would yield more easily to this transverse force and give a larger expression, which would\n\nMDCCCXXVI. * S\nserve to mark with more precision than heretofore, all the circumstances of this daily change. On trial, the amount was found to be very considerably increased; and he, still in pursuit of the same object, now undertook to ascertain the direction which the daily variation impressed upon the needle, when balanced at different azimuths; which was easily done by a slight adjustment of the magnets; and in this way he found that in two positions of the needle, viz. when its north end was directed either to N $16^\\circ$ W, or S $16^\\circ$ E, no daily variation, or a very little took place, and that on one side of this line, the needle passed in one direction, and on the other side in an opposite one.\n\nIn the memoir which the Author published relative to these experiments, he expresses a wish that some other persons would pursue this enquiry; and as the parts in which we were likely to winter in the recent voyage of discovery under Captain Parry, seemed highly favourable for the purpose, I determined to avail myself of this circumstance, and to make a regular set of such observations.\n\nWith respect to the daily variation, it was soon found, as was expected, that the needle being nearly neutralized by the great amount of dip, no artificial means would be necessary for increasing its amount: all the observations, therefore, on this head, were made with the needles suspended in their natural state, and the following are entirely devoted to the second object, viz. of determining the direction which the needle takes in consequence of the daily variation when directed to different points of the compass, and to ascertain the line of no daily variation, or at least that line in which the motion is a minimum.\nMr. Christie, in pursuing the experiments above referred to, and in those on the effects of temperature on magnets, had made use of an instrument admirably suited to such purpose; and he very obligingly superintended the construction of one somewhat similar for my use; a description and drawing of which he has given in his paper on the effects of temperature on magnets, published in the Phil. Trans. for 1825.\n\nIn these experiments, the apparatus was frozen to three firm stone supports, erected in a house built of snow, having the top covered with canvas; the zero on the compass-box was made to coincide with the direction of the needle at 6th A.M., that being, although somewhat arbitrarily considered (from the mean of the preceding month's observations on the daily variation), the magnetic meridian. The needle used was made of clock spring, very delicate and light, in length 4.5 inches, its greatest breadth at the centre was 0.45 inches, and its extremities terminated in sharp points; the pivot on which it rested was also repolished previous to the commencement of the observations.\n\nHaving considerably reduced the directive power of this needle in its natural direction, by the action of two bar magnets, placed in the magnetic meridian, and in the same horizontal plane with it; I began on the 14th of February to register the amount of the daily change at stated intervals throughout the twenty-four hours, the Officers of the ship kindly assisting me, by taking the observations at the times of my attendance to other duties. The states of the two thermometers placed upon the instrument, were also noted at the time of every observation; and to preserve the intensity of the magnets from being affected by any sudden change\nLieut. Foster's observations on the diurnal changes\n\nof temperature, produced by the approach of the observer, or other causes, they were thickly covered with snow after every adjustment.\n\nDuring that part of the day when the needles suspended with floss silk indicated westerly variation, the direction of this needle is marked towards the right hand, when the north end passes to the right hand of a person standing outside of the compass-box, and facing the north end of the needle; and to the left, when it passes towards the left hand.\n\nIn the following details is given a short description of the adjustment of the magnets to the needle, at the commencement of the observations in each position of its north end; and also the time in which it performed one vibration when under their influence, as well as the ratios in which the directive force was reduced by them; but it must be remembered, that these ratios are mere approximations, since the directive force was always so much diminished, that a sufficient number of vibrations could not be counted, to estimate the duration of one with the required exactness. In the annexed tables every phenomena, such as halos, aurora borealis, winds, state of the weather, and position of the moon, are inserted; together with such remarks, as suggested themselves at the time of observation. There is also inserted in italics in the column of remarks; max. easterly and westerly variation, opposite the hours at which they respectively took place by the suspended needle No. 2, in order to define the time of the day when the motion of this needle was towards the right, or left hand, as above described. And to point out the times of maximum westerly and easterly deflections of this needle, the signs + and — are prefixed to the hours of observation when they respectively happened.\nin the position of the horizontal needle, &c.\n\nNorth end of Needle to the North.\n\nThe magnets being placed to the north and south of the needle, with their axes coinciding with the magnetic meridian, the north magnet had its north pole, and the south magnet its south pole, directed towards the needle, at the distance of 31.5 inches from the centre of the compass-box. In this position of the magnets, the needle made one vibration in 15 seconds, so that the directive force was reduced in the ratio of 0.14 to 1 nearly.\n\n| Date       | Mean Time of Observation | A.

uniformity in the arrangement.*\nNorth end of Needle to the North.\n\nAt this time the magnets placed north and south of the needle, had their axes inclined to the magnetic meridian at an angle of 22 degrees, and the distance of their nearest ends from the centre of the needle was 32.95 inches. The time in which the needle now performed one vibration, was 10.24 seconds, and the directive force reduced in the ratio of 0.325 to 1.\n\n| Date       | Mean Time of Observation | A.M. or P.M. | Reading of north end of Needle | Temp.

Max. westerly position; as well as in its progress again to the westward, from 3rd to 6th P.M. It is also worthy of remark that during the latter interval, the intensity of the horizontal needle was observed to be very changeable, and the action of the suspended needles very irregular.\n\nMax. westerly var. happen'd at 2nd A.M.\n### Lieut.

2° the Aurora suddenly appeared in an arch from north to west by compass, with bright streamers shooting towards the zenith; the needle under the influence of magnets was not affected in any way whatever that I observed after watching it for one-quarter of an hour, when the Aurora became extremely faint.\n  - Max. westerly var.\n  - N. W. by compass.\n  - Aurora faint N. W.\n  - Aurora from N. to W.\nNorth end of Needle to the East.\n\nThe axes of the magnets placed north and south of the needle, were on this occasion inclined to the magnetic meridian at an angle of 22 degrees; the distance of the nearest ends of each, from the centre of the compass-box was 28 inches, and the time of performing one vibration by the needle was 16.4 seconds, so that the directive power now, was to the undiminished force as 0.113 to 1.\n\n| Date       | Mean Time of Observation | A.

needle, &c.*\nMarch 22nd. North end of Needle to the S. 83° W.\n\nThe following summary of the observations at this point, is given here, merely to prevent breaking the preceding series: they were commenced at 6 o'clock in the morning, at which time the north end of the needle was at S. 83° 30' W. where it remained until $\\frac{1}{2}$ past 9h; it then moved to S. 85° W. and became nearly stationary until about 11h 30m, at which time it was at S. 81° 30' W. and soon after, I observed it vibrating rapidly in very small arcs, which were continued with different degrees of intensity for the space of a quarter of an hour. During this time, simultaneous observations on the times of vibration of a horizontal needle were made, and as great fluctuations were observed in the intervals of 10 vibrations, I have inserted them in detail, as follows, in order to show the variations of horizontal intensity which take place in short intervals, and to which must be attributed the irregular vibratory motion observed in this needle.\n\n| Mean Time of Observation | Intervals of 10 vibrat. | Remarks |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| h. m. s.                 |                        |         |\n| 11 38 5,2                | m. s.                  |         |\n| 41 10                    | 3 4,8                  |         |\n| 44 13                    | 3 3                    |         |\n| 47 16,5                  | 3 3,5                  |         |\n| 50 19                    | 3 2,5                  |         |\n| 53 20,7                  | 3 1,7                  |         |\n| 56 22,5                  | 3 1,8                  |         |\n\nIt appears by these observations, that the intervals of 10 vibrations, exhibit changes of horizontal intensity to the amount of $\\frac{1}{5}$th part of those intervals, in the space of quarter of an hour.\nIn the foregoing observations, when the north end of the needle was directed towards the east or west points of the compass, it will be seen, that the various deflections of the needle rendered it difficult to discover which way its north end had proceeded during the time of westerly daily variation.\n\nThis anomalous action of the needle exhibited itself so strongly on the 23rd of February, that I was induced to compare the nature of some of its deflections, with simultaneous observations, on the times of vibration of a freely suspended horizontal needle; and as I found, in every instance of comparison, a decided relation between the changes of horizontal intensity, and these deflections, I began to watch the action of this needle more closely, at the times that fluctuations in the directive force of the horizontal needle, had hitherto been observed to take place; and from its indications, I frequently stated to the Gentlemen making the observations on horizontal intensity, what I considered would be the nature of the intervals they were about to obtain; which proving correct, no longer left any doubt on my mind, of the cause of these apparent irregularities. In order, however, to point out more satisfactorily the relation between the changes of horizontal intensity, and the various deflections of this needle, at other positions of its north end, I have annexed the observations on the times of performing 60 vibrations by a horizontal needle, taken during the same time; but this will not explain all the anomalies alluded to, without also stating, that the fluctuations which frequently took place in the intervals of 10 vibrations, were sometimes observed to compensate one another, so as, in the mean of sixty, to leave no\nindications of such changes having taken place; and it is only on these occasions, that the expression for the magnetic intensity of the horizontal needle is at variance with the irregular motion of the neutralized needle.\n\nOn looking over the observations it will also be seen, that when the north end of the needle was directed to the southward, between N. $85^\\circ$ E. and S. $85^\\circ$ W. its motion during the time of westerly daily variation was generally towards the left hand, but when directed to the northward, between N. $85^\\circ$ E. and S. $85^\\circ$ W. its motion was then most commonly to the right hand (see the figure in Plate IV.); and that when held between N. $85^\\circ$ E. and north, a greater daily change obtained than at any of the other positions, amounting in one instance to 50 degrees; but when directed to S. $85^\\circ$ W. no daily variation, or at least a minimum, exhibited itself.\n\nWith respect to the effect produced on the needle when held between N. $85^\\circ$ E. and north, it appears, from observations on the times of vibrations of a horizontal needle, that an increased intensity generally took place about noon, at which time also, the maximum westerly daily variation generally happened; and as we have already seen, that the motion of the north end of the needle in this position, during the time of westerly daily variation, was to the right hand, or towards the magnetic meridian, the effect of an increased intensity would be to draw it still further in that direction, and therefore, produce the extraordinary amount noticed. But with the north end of the needle, held between S. $85^\\circ$ W. and north, where its motion is still to the right hand at the time of westerly daily variation, the effect of increased intensity then, would be to draw the north end of the needle to the\n| Needle I. | Sun's Zenith Distance | Moon on the South Meridian | Moon on the North Meridian | Time of Zenith Dist. |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n|          | On the S.

Nevertheless it is a singular coincidence, that the true bearing of this line at Port Bowen (viz. S. 38° 4' E.) agrees nearly with Mr. Barlow's determination at Woolwich. It would, however, be desirable to have other observations, at places differing much in magnetic position, before drawing any conclusions as to the probability of its dependance on some general cause; especially, since the needle after remaining absolutely stationary for three successive days at S. 85° W., commenced moving with its north end towards the left hand, or west point of the compass, at half-past three P. M. on the 27th of March; without any apparent cause whatever, and that it did not again become stationary during the rest of the observations at this point, which were continued until the 5th of April; in the course of which, as will be seen, its north end sometimes proceeded towards the left, and at others towards the right hand, during the time of westerly daily variation.\n\nWhether this movement of the needle, on the 27th of March, took place in consequence of the changes of intensity in the opposing magnets (which were covered with snow), arising from the effects of temperature, or from the sudden variations of intensity of the horizontal needle which take place in short intervals of time, to which, I am most disposed to attribute it, is difficult to decide; it was not considered to be due to the effects of electricity, as there was no appearance of the Aurora* at the time, nor was\n\n* The Aurora generally appeared about north by compass, extending in an arch\nLieut.

Besides these observations on the daily changes of the horizontal needle, I also attempted a similar set on the dipping needle, but the difficulty of adjusting the magnets was such, as to prevent me from obtaining any satisfactory results.\n\nPort Bowen, July 1st, 1825.\n\nfrom about N. E. to N.W. at an elevation of from 10 to 20 degrees, with streamers sometimes shooting towards the zenith. At times when it was brightest, although not very brilliant during any part of the winter, I have frequently watched this needle, without ever being able to detect a change, that could be ascribed to its influence.",
