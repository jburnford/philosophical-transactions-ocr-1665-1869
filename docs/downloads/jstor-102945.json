That the Altitude of the Spirits in the Thermometer and Philosophical Barometer was commonly taken at Noon.\n\nNote 2. That the account of the Winds and Weather at Sea, is from Noon to Noon.\n\nNote 3. That the middle Inclination of the Dipping Needle is set down with the difference also which was made, as either side of the Compass was turn'd East or West: Which difference at first was not taken notice of. From whence this difference should arise, I cannot determine, the Compass seeming to be justly pois'd and equally divided.\n\nFor the few Chasmata in the Columns of the Thermometer and Barometer, there needs no other Apology, than that I was not on board to take an account of them myself.",
