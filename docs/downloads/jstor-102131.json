By the direction of the Philosophicall Society of Oxford.\n\nThe following bodies were poured gently into the vessel, and those in the first 12 first Experiments were weighed in scales turning with 2 ounces, but the last 7 were weighed in scales turning with one ounce. The pounds, and ounces here mention'd are Avoirdupois.\n\n1. A foot of Wheat (worth 6½ a Bushell) weighed of Avoirdupois weight. 47. 8\n\n2. Wheat of the best sort (worth 6½ a bushell.) 48. 4\n\n3. The same sort of Wheat measured a 2d time. 48. 2\n\nBoth sorts were red lammas Wheat of the last year.\n\n4. White Oats of the last year. 29. 8\n\nThe best sort of Oats were 2½ in a bushell better than these.\n\n5. Blew Pease (of the last year,) & much worm-eaten. 49. 12\n\n6. White Pease of the last year but one. 50. 8\n\n7. Barley of the last year: (the best sort sells for 1½ in a quarter more than this:) 41. 2\n\n8. Malt of the last years Barley, made 2 months before. 30. 4\n\n9. Field Beans of the last year but one. 50. 8\n\n10. Wheaten Meal, (unsifted.) 31. 0\n\n11. Rye Meal unsifted. 28. 4\n\n12.
