  "text": "III. Part of a Letter from Mr Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S. to Dr Hans Sloane, S. R. S. concerning some Norman Coys found at York.\n\nI had several weeks ago given you an account of some old Coys lately found at York, but that I forbore, in hopes to make the account more perfect; which is as follows: Mr Samuel Buxton, late Sheriff of that Ancient City, designing to Build upon a Piece of Ground he had bought in High Ousegate, had Labourers to remove the Rubbish of a former House; which, with about 30 more, was burnt down April 3, 1694. In digging below the Foundations of the former House, at a considerable depth they discovered the more Ancient Foundations of an older Fabrick; very probably unknown to the Builders of the later House. These lower Foundations were very well supported at several Angles with good Oak Piles, some of which were so firm and found, that they were good again for the same purpose; besides these Piles, there were several great Timber-trees, that lay athwart, to make the stronger Foundation: Betwixt the head of two Piles in this lower Foundation, the Work men found a little decayed Oak box, wherein had been hoarded about 200 or 250 pieces of the Norman Coys; but age and the moisture of the place had so defaced them, that not much above 100 of them could be preserved. Through the Gentlemans kindness (who presented me with some of them) I had the perusal of about half that number, (the rest being given away before I heard of them) which proved the noblest stock that ever I saw, or indeed, heard of, of William the Conqueror's Coys; not above 2 or 3 in the whole Cargo that I saw being of any other Prince: Those, tho later in\ntime, are more rare in value than many of the Roman and Saxon Coyns: these lower foundations also very well answer the account we have of the Timber-buildings in those Ages.\n\nThe Coyns are very much alike; the King is represented full-faced, with a Crown and Labels, but neither Scepter, Cross or Star, as in other Moneys of his that I had before; most of them are inscribed WILLEMV REX, which some have mistaken for William the 2d; but by the declining of the strokes, it appears to be design'd for V, as I have one with the S after the V and before REX. By this accident there appears greater Variety, than ever was known before, of the Conqueror's Money, thro' the kindness of Mr Buxton and others. I have of these sorts, WILLEMV REX. WILLEMVS REX. WILLEMV REX. I. (which is not to be reckoned a Numeral Letter, it being improper to pretend a distinction, when there was none of the Name before, but for part of the Letter A) WILEM REX A. (Anglia.) And for the Reverse I have that were Coyn'd at LONDRE. (London.) EO FERwick. (York.) WINC (Winchester.) EXETE (Exeter.) LIN (Lincoln, I presume, Lyn-Regis not being old enough.) LINCOL (Lincoln.) DEOTFORND (Thetford.) and LOYNC (which I take for Lorn or Lancaster. I have only one duplicate, which I present to you, and hope you will find it safe in the Seal of the Letter; 'tis inscribed + WILLEMV REX I. Reverse + DEII. IRD ON LIN.",
