  "text": "Two Observations of the last Eclipse November 30th last, made at Nuremberg; the one by Mr. G. C. Eimmart, the other by Mr. J. Ph. Wurtzelbaur: Communicated by Mr. Theodore Haak R. S. S.\n\nThis Eclipse of the Moon was the more remarkable, for that it fell out very near the Apogeeon of the Moon, and was nearly central; so that the duration was as great as possible. But so it happened, that neither at London nor Greenwich, nor Paris it could be seen by reason of thick Clouds, for the whole time intercepting the sight of the Moon: The only Account we have received is already published, from Letters of the famous Mr. Hevelius of Dantzig, in Num. 178 of these Transactions: and now these two from Nuremberg, made by the industrious Observers Mr. Eimmart and Mr. Wurtzelbaur.\n\nThe Observations of Mr. Eimmart was as follows.\n\n9h. 19 min. the Penumbra was very obscure, and the beginning of the Eclipse was at hand.\n\n9h. 23m. 30s. the Eclipse was begun, the quantity almost half a digit, and the distance between the cusps was about 42 degrees of the Moon's limb, and Palus Mareotis was just all Eclipsed; hence we may conclude the beginning about 9h. 21m. 30s.\n\n10h. 23m. 30s. as near as I can collect from the Observators words, was the time of the total Immersion into the shadow, to verse which, the Azimuth of the Moon's center was observed to the East, 41gr. 48m. 2min. 12sec. of time after the said Immersion.\n\n12h. 23min. or 10m. 13sec. before the Culmination of the right shoulder of Orion, was the Emersion or first appearance of the Moon out of the total Darkness.\n\n13h. 14min. fere was the just end of the Ecclipse, being 2m. 20sec. before the Culmination of Sirius or the great Dogg.\n\nWhence\nWhence the middle of this Eclipse should have hapned at 11h. 18min. P. M. at Nuremburgh: the total duration 3h. 52min. 30sec. and the total darkness 1h. 49m. 3os.\n\nThe Meridian Altitude of the Moon's upper limb was observed 63gr. 23m. 50sec. and the Moon's apparent Diameter while totally Eclipsed was found 30m. 7sec.\n\nThe other Observer Mr. Wurtzelbaur made use of the Pendulum Clock, corrected by Altitudes. According to his Observation.\n\n9h. 23m. 30sec. was the beginning of the Eclipse, at about 119 degrees of the limb of the Moon in Hevelius's Selenography.\n\n9h. 24m 50sec. Paulus Mareotis was all covered.\n\n10h. 25m. 20sec. The Total Immersion; about the 299th degree of the limb of the Moon.\n\n12h. 11m. 30sec. The Moon began to emerge out of the shadow, about the 112th degree of her limb.\n\n13h. 14m. 30sec. The End of the Eclipse about the 295th degree of the limb.\n\nBy these Observations the middle of the Eclipse ought to have been about 11h. 12m. P. M. at Nuremburg, differing but one minute from Mr. Eimmart's Observation. The duration will be 3h. 51min. and the total Darkness 1h. 46m.\n\nThe Longitude of Nuremburg has been formerly stated 11 degrees from London, and since found to be so by Observations of the last Eclipse of the Sun July 2d 1684, which made it 44½ min. of time. So that the middle of this Eclipse at London should have been 10h. 34½m. which from the Observation of Mr. Hevelius had been formerly concluded 10h. 35m.\n\nAn Extract of a Letter written from Aramont in Languedoc near Avignon, giving an account of an extraordinary swarm of Grasshoppers in those parts; communicated by Mr. Jusell R. S. S.\n\nSince you demand of me a Relation of the Grass-hoppers that have eaten up our Harvest the last Year, and which give",
