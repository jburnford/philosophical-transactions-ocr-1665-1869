Mr. Baker received a letter yesterday from Dr. Alexander Garden, of Charles Town in South Carolina, part of which he hopes he shall be excused for laying before the Royal Society.

The Doctor writes thus:—"As you desired, I tried the effects of the prickly pear in colouring the urine. A few days after your letter, I went down to one of the islands, and gathered some of the fruit, and gave four of the pears to a child of three years of age, and six pears to one of five. The next morning I examined the urine of both, and it appeared of a very lively red colour, as if tent-wine had been mixed with clear water. The urine of the eldest was deeper coloured, and of a darker look: the youngest (who always naturally made clear urine) was of a more lively and beautiful red. Next day I gave six pears to a Negroe wench, who gave suck, and strictly forbade her suckling her child for six or eight hours; and then taking some of her milk in a tea-cup, and setting it by for some hours, the cream had a reddish lustre, tho' it was very faint.

I was led to this last experiment by an observation, which I made on the milk of cows, who had
"had fed in an indigo-field: the indigo had not
only tinged their urine blue, but the cream of
the milk was of a most beautiful blue colour, and
had a radiated appearance from the centre (Is it
not hence probable, that the dye is the oily part
of the plant?). The milk underneath was clear
and white as usual."

Dr. Garden wrote, a year ago, that the prickly
pear grows in great abundance about Carolina; and
also that the cochineal insects are found upon it;
but hitherto no attempts have been made to cure
them as the Spaniards do. In hope, that some rich
dye may be produced from the plant itself, Mr.
Baker proposed some experiments to Dr. Garden,
which he intends to prosecute this summer.
