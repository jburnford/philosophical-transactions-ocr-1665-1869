Communicated by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. P. R. S.\n\nRead April 30, 1789.\n\nTO SIR JOSEPH BANKS, BART.\n\nSIR,\n\nFort St. George, Feb. 28, 1788.\n\nI have the pleasure to transmit to you the portrait of a Gentoo boy, an astonishing living subject, who being sent to me by a friend of mine residing in the environs of the native place of the boy, I made two drawings representing the alternate attitudes in which he can place half the body of his little brother, who adheres to his breast. See Tab. II. Peruntaloo is a handsome well-made lad, possessing every due faculty of mind and body, rather more sagacious, and with a superior share of understanding, than young men in general of his age. In addition to the inclosed anatomical description of the boy by Mr. Anderson, you will observe in the drawings two circular dotted lines, about the lower part of the loins of the semi-monster. During the several sittings I had of Peruntaloo, I observed an internal motion about these parts rather more conspicuous than any other of the body; and upon questioning the youth, he shewed me, that by retaining his breath, he could force a current of air into them, so as to swell the parts like two blown-up bladders, with a rumbling noise at the time of action. Whether there is a connection with the lungs of Peruntaloo is a question\nBaron Reichel's Account of a\n\na question I cannot venture to determine; Mr. Anderson, however, thinks it well worth my mentioning this observation. The erection of the little penis in the semi-monster, and the command Peruntaloo has of discharging the urine through it, are perfectly ascertained.\n\nSuch as this subject is, if with any merit, you may depend upon the correctness of the drawings.\n\nI am, &c.\n\nT. REICHEL.\n\nTo Baron Reichel.\n\nSir,\n\nFort St. George, Feb. 25, 1788.\n\nAs you mean to send the elegant drawing of Peruntaloo to Sir Joseph Banks, you may acquaint him from me, that the little brother is suspended by the os pubis; an elongation of the sword-like cartilage of Peruntaloo having anastomosed with that bone at the symphysis.\n\nThe lower orifice of the stomach seems to lie in the sac or cylindrical cavity between the two brothers on the right-side, and what may be reckoned the right hypochondre of the little one, as that part is tumid and full after eating.\n\nThe alimentary canal must be common to both, as the anus of the little one is imperforate.\n\nThere is a bladder of urine distinctly perceived, which occupies the left side of the sac, or left hypochondre of the monster.\n\nBesides which, there remain only the sacrum, osa innominata, and lower extremities perfect.\n\nPeruntaloo\nPeruntaloo says he has as complete a sense of feeling with every part of the body of his little brother as of his own proper body, and this may account for the erections you saw, and making water distinctly; but this volition does not extend to the legs or feet, which are cold in comparison with the rest.\n\nI am, &c.\n\nJAMES ANDERSON.\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATE.\n\nPeruntaloo, son of Chindrahpaah-Nayandoo, of the Gentoo Cast. He was born at Popelpahdoo, 70 miles west from Musilipatnam. He is 13 years of age, and measures 4 feet 6½ inches in height.\n\nFig. 1. Natural position.\nFig. 2. Reversed position.",
