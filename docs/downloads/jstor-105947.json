S. 1752.\n\nRead July 3, 1767.\n\nAFTER pumping about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an hour, a Fahrenheit's thermometer, held in the stream from the common pump of the king's bath, was raised to $112^\\circ$. The stream from the common pump of the hot bath raised it to $114^\\circ$. At the pump of the cross bath, it stood at $110^\\circ$. At noon, the heat of the shaded air was $66^\\circ$, and of common water exposed to it $61^\\circ$. I found the bath water, and common water, brought to the same degree of heat, to cool equally fast. The next day, Sept. 14, I was at the hot-well near Bristol, the water of which raised the thermometer to $76^\\circ$. In common water exposed to the shaded air it stood at $62^\\circ$.\n\nJ. Canton.",
