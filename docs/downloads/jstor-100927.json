  "text": "lately imparted to the Royal Society, by Signor Malpighi, an Italian, and Dr. Croon an English physician, both Fellows of that Society. He concludeth all with an excellent Chapter, treating of the Generation of Rabbets, and thereby confirming all the main parts of his former doctrine.\n\nIV. Discours de la CONOISSANCE des BESTES; par le P. Ignace Gaston Pardies, S. J. A Paris 1672. in 12°\n\nThe learn'd Author of this Book examines therein the Opinion of those, that esteem Beasts to be meer Engins without any perception and Knowledge. In the doing of which, he represents at large and to advantage what hath been and may be alleged in favour of that doctrine; that so, when he shall be found by the Teachers of it not to be of their sentiment, they may not Judge him to be a Dissenter at least for want of having considered their reasons.\n\nAfter he hath spent the greatest part of his discourse in urging the arguments for the sole Mechanical Contrivance of the Structure and Operations of Beasts; and interspersed the discussion of the Opinion of the other extreme, which adscribes Reason to them: He declares at last his sense of this whole matter, and endeavours to prove, That Beasts, though they have not any Intellectual, yet they have a Sensible knowledge; or, though they have not such a perception that essentially carrieth with it a reflection upon itself; yet they have a simple apprehension of Objects without that reflexion. So that he esteems, that from this distinction all the difficulties, that have been proposed, will vanish; and that the reasons, alleged to the contrary, prove indeed, that Beasts have no Spiritual knowledge, but not at all, that they have no Sensible one. For the particulars, whereby this is endeavoured to be made out, we refer the Reader to the Book itself.\n\nAdvertisement.\n\nA short Essay Printed in half a sheet of Paper, wherein Rules are laid down, directing, how to divide a Period into sentences; with what Points the Sentences shall be distinguished, and how to read those Sentences Grammatically; more distinct than what has been formerly done: Very useful for the clearness of any discourse, and for expeditious and distinct reading.
