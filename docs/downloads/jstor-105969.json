Dated London, 14 February, 1767.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRead Nov. 19, 1767.\n\nTHIS waits upon you to inform you of the degree of cold we have lately experienced. After as mild a winter as has been known here for many years, the frost has been intense. Until the latter end of December, many of the tender annual exotic plants continued alive; such as the African Marygold, Nasturtium Indicum, and others of this class. I saw even the plant, usually called Balm of Gilead, at that time flourishing without shelter. Mr. Miller of Chelsea, with whom I talked upon this subject, informed me, that he had known the like but twice in his life; and that was in the years 1717 and 1722. However, at the beginning of last month, January, after some smart gusts of wind at East, it began to freeze; and continued increasing, until the fifth of that month, in the morning, my thermometer, an excellent one made by Mr. Bird, stood in the open air somewhat under 20°, in the evening it was 29°. It continued thereabouts to the ninth, when in the morning it stood at 20° again, and at night at 21°. On the tenth in the morning it stood at 17°, at night at 18°. From this time to the eighteenth it was never below 23°, but frequently\nfrequently above the freezing point. On the eighteenth at night it stood at $19''$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$. On the nineteenth at six in the morning it stood at $16''$, at eight in the morning $15'' \\frac{1}{2}$, at eleven at night $17''$. On the twentieth at eight in the morning it stood at $18''$, at eleven at night $22''$. On the next day, January twenty-first, the frost broke; the thermometer at four in the afternoon standing at $36''$.\n\nIn the country it has been observed much colder. On January tenth, at Cardington in Bedfordshire, Mr. Howard, Fellow of the Royal Society, by two thermometers, observed the mercury, at six in the evening, to stand at $9''$. And upon the same day the Rev. Mr. Wollaston, at East Dereham in Norfolk, found it so low as $8''$. Mr. Ellinet, at Norwich, on the nineteenth of January, found his thermometer, at eight o'clock in the morning, to stand at $7''$; at noon at $22''$; at five in the afternoon $18''$; at ten at night at $8''$. Seven degrees therefore is the lowest point, at which I have heard the thermometer has stood anywhere in England during the late frost.\n\nJanuary tenth was the coldest day at Plymouth, where Dr. Farr, a very ingenious physician, and Mr. Mudge, who has communicated several papers to the Royal Society, each observed his thermometer to stand at $23''$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe severe frost of 1739, of which no account appears in the Philosophical Transactions, began December twenty-ninth, when Lord Charles Cavendish's thermometer in his room stood at $25''$; the next evening $21''$.\n\nFrom this time his Lordship placed his instrument out of the window, and at some distance from it; when\nin the evening of December thirtieth, it stood at $17''$. On the morning of January fifth, it stood at $13''$. On the eighth at $15''$. The ninth at $14''$. Twenty-second at $19''$. Twenty-fifth at $17''$. On February fifth at $21''$. During all this time, the thermometer was seldom above $32''$, the freezing point.\n\nThirteen degrees, therefore, during this frost, was the lowest observation, by Lord Charles Cavendish in Marlborough Street.\n\nI am,\n\nwith all possible respect,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nyour most obliged,\n\nand obedient Servant,\n\nW. Watson.\nAbstract from a Meteorological Diary kept at Plymouth.\n\nThis contains Observations twice a Day; the Barometer and Thermometer are made by Sisson, the Rain Machines also, and similar to that described in the Edinburgh Medical Essays.\n\nN. B. One of the Thermometers is kept in a Parlour where there is no Fire, the other without Doors in the Rain Machine, which is never affected by the Sun, but was not examined before or after the Sun set; so that the lowest State of the Thermometer in these Parts is not ascertained.\n\n**JANUARY 1767.**\n\n| Day | Bar. | Ther. within doors | Ther. without doors | Wind. | Rain | Weather |\n|-----|------|-------------------|--------------------|-------|------|---------|\n| 1   | 9 a.m.| 30 20             | 44                 | N.    | 2    | Clear   |\n|     | 11 p.m.| 29 84             | 45                 | E. b.
