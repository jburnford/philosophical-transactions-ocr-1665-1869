the red Matter had been then consumed, put an End to the Phænomenon before Eight.

During the rest of the Evening, a pale Light covered the South Part of the Heavens, as if the Moon had shone.

V. A Letter from Mr. Christopher Maire to the President, containing Observations made at Rome of the Eclipse of the Moon, Dec. 23. 1749; and of that of the Sun, Jan. 8. 1750.

Honour'd Sir,

Read Febr. 1. I Herewith send you my Observation of the two late Eclipses, to be communicated, if you please, to the Royal Society. The 23d of December, on which happened that of the Moon, was so boisterous a Day, that I despair'd of being able to see it, and for that Reason neglected to put my Micrometer in Order. My Clock had likewise been altered without my Knowledge, on which Account I betook myself too late to the Observation, as will appear by the following Detail. The Place of both Observations is in the Latitude of 41° 54' 0". four Seconds of Time Eastward of St. Peter's. For I take it
it for granted that the Thermae Dioclesianae are, according to Bianchini's Determination, in the Latitude of $41^\circ 54' 27''$.

Eclipse of the Moon, Dec. 23. 1749.

Chord of the Part eclipsed 13 Min. as was deduc'd from the Map of the Moon - $7^h 47' 18''$
Hence Beginning of the Eclipse - $7^h 40' 53''$
The Shade to Tycho and Capuanus - $7^h 54' 3''$
Tycho intirely covered - $7^h 55' 56''$
Shade to Fracastorius - $8^h 28' 43''$
Fracastorius quite hid - $8^h 30' 24''$
Tycho intirely disengaged - $9^h 30' 24''$
End of the Eclipse, as far as could be perceiv'd thro' a thin Cloud - $10^h 0' 16''$

I judg'd the Eclipse to be somewhat less than five Digits.

Solar Eclipse, Jan. 8. 1750.

Beginning by a Reflector of Mr. Short,
Jan. 7. - $20^h 34' 35''$
The first Spot covered - $20^h 49' 50''$
The rest could not be observed for the Clouds
Quantity of the Eclipse 7 Dig. 48. Min. $21^h 49' 4''$
Again more exactly - $7^h 43' - 21^h 51' 28''$
The Sun appears for a Moment; Horns nearly horizontal - $21^h 56' 15''$
Two Digits remain eclipsed $22^h\ 55'\ 37''$
One Digit exactly $23\ 3\ 42$
End of the Eclipse $23\ 11\ 32'$

The Observation was made with a 7 Foot Tube,
2610 Parts of the Micrometer just clasping the Sun's Diameter.

I am, with all possible Respect,

Honoured Sir,

Rome, Jan. 14. 1750.

Your most Obedient
Humble Servant
Christopher Maire.

VI. Some Observations on the Dragon-Fly or Libella of Pennsylvania, collected from Mr. John Bartram's Letters, communicated by Peter Collinson, F. R. S.

Read Feb. 1. About the Beginning of May I observed many deformed Water-Insects, by Naturalists called Hexipodes, creep up out of the Water, and fix themselves on the Shrubs and Rushes; in this Situation they continue but a few Hours before their Back splits open; and from this deformed Case creeps out a beautiful Fly, with shining transparent Wings:
