Pipes joined together, so as to constitute one greater. Yet these Pipes were very full, which hindered my better observation of them.

Microscopical Observations of the Structure of Hair: Made also and Communicated by the abovesaid Mr. Anthony Leeuwenhoeck.

I have formerly examined the Structure of Hair; and so much as I thought I saw myself, shewed to certain learned Gentlemen; who then all agreed with me, that it consisted wholly of Globules. As did also to my thinking the Hoof of an Elk. But not being satisfied, without further inquiry; I took the Hair of my Beard, after it had been shaved the first, second, third, and fourth days, and observed, That the little particles which we saw through the common Microscopes (which yet were very good) and which appeared round, were indeed irregular, and lay very closely pressed one upon another. Of these particles consist the outer parts, or Cuticle (or, as the Author calls them, Clods) of the Hair. One of these Hairs I met with, which seemed rare, being on the one side convex, on the other
