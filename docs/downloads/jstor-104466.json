A Copy of a Letter from the Reverend Mr. Richmond, to ——— Leigh, Esq; of Adlington in the County of Chester, concerning a moving Moss in the Neighbourhood of Church-Town in Lancashire: Communicated by Edward Milward, M.D. F.R.S.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRead Feb. 28. 1744-5.\n\nAs you will probably hear, that this Neighbourhood is greatly alarmed with what they call a Miracle, it may not be unacceptable if I give you the History of it.\n\nOn Saturday the 26th of Jan. 1744-5, a Part of Pilling Moss, lying between Hescomb Houses and an Estate of Mr. Butler's, called Wild Bear, was observed to rise to a surprising Height: After a short Time it sunk as much below the Level, and moved slowly towards the South Side: In half an Hour's time it cover'd 20 Acres of Land. The improved Land adjoining that Part of the Moss which moves is a concave Circle containing near 100 Acres, which is well nigh fill'd up with Moss and Water. In some Parts it is thought to be five Yards deep. A Family is driven out of their dwelling House, which is quite surrounded, and the Fabric tumbling down. Mr. Butler, Whitehead, and Stephen White, are the first Sufferers by this uncommon Accident. An intense Frost retards the Regress of the Moss To day; but I fear it will yet spoil a great deal of Land. The Part of the Moss which is sunk like the Bed of a River, runs\nruns North and South; is above a Mile in Length, and near half a Mile in Breadth; so that I apprehend there will be a continual Current to the South. A Man was going over the Moss when it began to move: As he was going Eastward, he perceiv'd, to his great Astonishment, that the Ground under his Feet moved Southward. He turn'd back speedily, and had the good Fortune to escape being swallowed up. I have been at the Moss to make Observations every Day this Week: If any thing happens worth your Knowlege, you may depend upon hearing further from,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour very affectionate\n\nHumble Servant,\n\nL. Richmond.\n\nXIII. A brief Inquiry, by John Ward, F.R.S. & Rhet. Prof. Gresh. into the Reading of two Dates in Arabian Figures, cut upon Stones which were found in Ireland; communicated to the Royal Society, on November 10. 1743. and December 6. 1744.\n\nRead Feb. 28. TWO Dates in Arabian Figures, transmitted from Ireland, were some time since laid before this Learned Society. But as the",
