Honour, for Cities and Towns; and especially for both our Famous Universities, where they have many Colleges with spacious Walks and fair Gardens.

6. And for our choice of the most convenient Plants, ingenious Muffet (in his third Chapter of Healths Improvement) learnedly instructs us, by the experience of many Ages and Nations, to avoid some Plants of a noxious and poisonous breath, and to adopt Health-breathing Plants; of which benign kind great variety is now found by many Trials to agree with our Soil and Climate. So that our Universities have no necessity to yield to the Reputation of Leyden for their Aquatic Arbors, since ours may soon be furnished with more wholesome, beautiful and fragrant Blossoms and Evergreens. And more Essays grow on apace.

For all these Concernments, I could do no less than give publick notice of the seasonable Aids and Encouragements herein afforded by this our skilful and industrious Author.

Postscript.

If among their Adorning-Trees due care be had for the planting of Mulberry-trees, in the approaches of Cities and Towns, they may do well in time for many Poor in England; as the care for the same hath brought a vast Treasure into France.

IV and V. The French Gardiner reprinted; to which is annexed the English Vineyard vindicated, and the Way of making and ordering Wines in France, &c.

For another Concernment I must again give notice, that The French Gardiner, which gives proper Instructions for the culture and propagation of the best Esculent Plants, (which are yet much wanting in England,) is reprinted in a third Edition, Illustrated with Sculptures: To which is annexed, The English Vineyard vindicated; and, The Way of making and ordering Wines in France: in octavo. Sold by Mr. Tooke at the Ship in Paul's Churchyard.

"The Fruits of the Earth, and especially of Trees (faith Mr. J.W.p.148.) were the first food ordained for Man to eat; by eating of which (before Flesh became his meat) he lived to a greater age than any since have been observed to have lived."
