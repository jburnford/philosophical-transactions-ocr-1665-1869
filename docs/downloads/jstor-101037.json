  "text": "over great mountains, and coming from it, I pass'd over Swartzenberg or the Black mountain, from whence I descended 10 miles in a rocky Country, and far more stony than the Cran or Campus lapidosis in Provence; and so to Aidischini and Goritia, and leaving the Selavonian behind, entred into the Lingua Fullana, and so on to this Noble and incomparably fortified City; where being yet uncertain, whether I should go to Venice, I would not omit to present you this accompt, which I beseech you to accept from &c.\n\nPalma nova in Friuli June 15. 1669.\n\nAn Accompt from the same Dr. Brown Concerning an Un-common Lake, called the Zirchnitzer-See, in Carniola.\n\nHaving cross'd the River Dravus, and pass'd Mount Luitzel in the Carnick Alpes, by that noble passage, cut through the Rooks, and vaulted like that of Pausilype near Naples, I had a desire to take a view of the Lake of Zirchnitz, so much spoken of, and written on by so few; and therefore I went unto Crainburg upon the River Savus, and so to Labach, the chief City of Carniola; from whence I continued my Journey in Carniola betwixt the Hills and a great Marsh, till I came to Brounizza, two leagues from whence and beyond the Hills is seated the said Lake, receiving that name from Zirchnitz, a town of about 300 houses.\n\nThis Lake is near two German Miles long, and one broad. On the South-side thereof lies a great Forrest, wherein are many Deer, and wild Boares, Wolves and Bears. On the North side the Country is flat; but the whole Valley is encompassed with Hills, at some distance from it.\n\nThis Lake is well fill'd with Water for the greatest part of the Year; but in the Month of June it sinketh under ground, not only by percolation or falling through the pores of the Earth, but retireth under ground, through many great holes at the bottom of it: And in the Month of September it returns by the same, and so in a very short time fills up the Valley again.\n\nAs the time of the waters Descent is short, especially when\nthe Lake grows lower, and hath for a while shewed some abatement, so the Ascent and return is speedy; for at these holes it mounteth with such violence, that it springs out of the ground to the height of a pike, and soon covers the track of Earth again.\n\nAnd this piece of ground in the time of the retirement and absence of the Water is not unfruitful, but by a speedy and plentiful production of Grass yieldeth not only a present sustenance for the beasts of the field, but a good provision of hay for the cattle in the winter.\n\nNor have the Inhabitants thereabout only the benefit of the ground by these Commodities, but also the recreation and profit by Hunting. For at the time of the waters absence, Hares, Deer, Boares and other Animals come into it out of the neighbouring Forrest and Country, and are taken several ways by them.\n\nThe Lake is not only thus fill'd with water, but every year will stand with fish. The Prince of Eckenberg is Lord of it and of much Country thereabout: But upon restoring of the waters all have liberty to Fish; and the fishermen, standing up to the waist at the holes before-mentioned, intercept the passage of the Fish, and take a very great number of them, which otherwise would be secure for some Months under the Earth, and not fail to return in September.\n\nThe inhabitants this Lake have a closer habitation than those of any other I know; for, they pass some Months under the Earth, and a good part of the Winter under Ice. I could not learn, that there were any Otters in this Lake, (which otherwise must probably have taken the same Course with the fish;) nor that there were any remarkable extraneous substances, any Vegetables, or unknown Fishes brought up by the water, but those which come up are of the same kind with those which descended.\n\nBut beside these holes at the bottom of the Lake (of which there are many) there are also divers Caverns and deep places in the Country of Carniola, even where there is no water; after the like manner as we have in the Peach-country, and at Elden-hole in England.\nHalf an English mile nearer the Lake than the town of Zirch-\nnitz, stands a village named Seadorf, and neighe to the Lake\nthan this, another village called Niderdorf: between these two\nthere are Corn-fields; yet sometimes these lands are also drown'd;\nand 'tis conceived, that there are divers subterraneous Caverns\nunder them: for, it happens sometimes at Niderdorf, that the\nground sinks in several places upon the sudden retiring of the\nLake, and the aforesaid Prince of Eckenberg was once so curious,\nas to descend into one ho'e, through which he passed under an\nHill, and came out on the other side; as I was informed by Mon-\nsieur Andreas Wifer the present Judge of Zirchnitz, and also by\nJohannes Wifer, who hath formerly held the same place.\n\nThe people who are acquainted with the Lake, wet and dry,\nknow where they are, and have a particular knowledge of the\neminencies, vallies and inequalities of it: for, the bottom of the\nLake is not even, or near about the same depth, but sometimes\ntwo foot, and then suddenly twenty yards deep. And because\nthe Fish haunt the deep places more than the shallows; they have\ngiven names to the 7 chiefest cavities or valleys in the Lake.\n\nI took boat at Niderdorf's, and went divers miles on the Lake,\npassing over the five first valleys. I went also to a noted Stone,\ncommonly called the Fishers-stone, which hath somewhat of the\nuse of the Nile-scope-pillar at Grand Cairo; for by a certain appea-\nrance of that, they conjecture how soon the Lake will retire. I\nalso passed by a noted Hill, which, when the Lake is high, be-\ncomes a pleasant island; and so I returned, &c.\n\nVenice June 20, 1669.",
