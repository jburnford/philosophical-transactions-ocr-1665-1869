S.\n\nRead January 15, 1784.\n\nSIR,\n\nMinehead, March 27, 1783.\n\nThe numberless philosophical discoveries and meteorological journals which I find have been addressed to you, as being a gentleman whose great abilities have raised you to the highest pitch of grandeur in the philosophical world, and which, I find, have been treated with the greatest candour and respect, and published under your direction for the improvement of scientific knowledge, make me presume (though an unknown, and even unheard of, individual) to direct this journal to you, not boasting, but rather doubting, of its being worthy of your reception; but my having found so great a difference between the last year and several preceding years, in the variations of the atmosphere, both barometrical and thermometrical, induced me to communicate it to other observers through your approbation.\n\nI am, &c.\nTHE instruments are kept at a house about thirty feet above high water in the Bristol Channel. The barometer is made after de Luc's method; and to observe the most minute alteration I have divided it into the one-sixteenth of a line, or 192 parts in an inch. The thermometer is a mercurial one, graduated according to Fahrenheit's scale, as being the most universal, though, I think, a partial one, and placed in the open air in a northern aspect. An hygrometer I have likewise kept in the open air; but being an instrument that does not admit of, as I ever heard of, a certain basis, whereon to fix the fundamental point between the greatest moisture and greatest drought, and therefore of little use to distant observers, I have omitted these observations. For the ease of correspondent observers, I have drawn two columns of the barometer; the first divided into 192d parts of an inch; the second into 100th parts. The figures in the column of winds denote its strength from 0 to 90 degrees of a quadrant. And the most prevailing winds are from north to west, being generally in those directions two-thirds of the year, occasioned, as I imagine, by the indraught of the Bristol Channel. The barometer this year has taken a greater range than ever I found these several years, being 2.44 inches. The thermometer likewise from 21° to 81°; and the three rainy months of October, November, and December, there fell very little more rain than fell in the month of August alone, which is very uncommon in this part of the kingdom. On the ninth of February an odd phenomenon appeared to me about 10 miles from hence, on my journey to Tiverton. I observed an halo, exactly similar to that of the sun, the center of the arch about 15° high, and both ends terminated in a field of snow; but as rainbows are seen only with the sun behind one's back, this, on the contrary, was between me and the sun.\n\nJanuary\n## January 1782\n\n| Day | Hour | Weather                  | Winds | Clouds | Barom. 192 parts | Barom. 100 parts | Thermom. | Rain
