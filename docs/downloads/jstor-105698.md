The alteration of the angles of position made by the cusps of the Moon, and a planet to which the Moon makes a near appulse, will always enable the astronomically inclined to determine from observation, the longitudes of places, by the naked eye and a clock or watch set to apparent or equal time.—Such an observation I made at Chelsea 25th Dec. 1762 at $11^h - 0' - 30''$ apparent time, the satellites being as in the figure at the same time. — Jupiter's distance from the Moon half a degree. Tab. II.

Lat. $51^\circ 29' 5''$, Long. $41''$ West of Greenwich.
