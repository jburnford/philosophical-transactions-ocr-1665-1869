To which are added some Animals sent him from those Parts.\n\nThese were gathered between the 22th and 27th of March, 1696. at Chamberamback and Aumerampead, 14 or 16 miles from Fort St George: Dry ground generally, and good soil. At this Place is a Pond 12 miles round.\n\n93. Tetum-cootan Malabar.\n\nLycium Chamberambacum Laurifoliis floribus comosis.\nAn Kanden Kara Hort. Malab. Vol. 5. Tab. 36. Pag. 71 H. Mal V. 5.

The Decoction of the Root, Bark, Leaves, Flowers and Fruit (which is white, round, and as big as Pease) Cures Coughs, Ulcers of the Lungs, Consumptions and Hectic Fevers: The Natives use it boil'd up with Butter for the same.

Cant maun-chedde Malab.\n\nI cannot perceive this to differ either in Flower or Fruit, and especially in its Leaves, from our Mango Sylvetris Madraspat. fructu Cerasi Musci nost. 659. and mentioned\ntioned in the Philos. Transf. No 264. p. 581. i. Nevertheless Dr Plukenet hath made them two, and given them new names in his Mantissa, p. 125.\n\nThis wild Mango Tree is 12 or 14 foot high, and as thick as a mans Leg. The Fruit sowre, and big as a Hazel-nut. A Decoction of the Root, Leaves, Flowers, Bark and Fruit, or 3 spoonfuls of the Juice of them taken night and morning Cures Running of the Reins and Sharpness of Urine. S. B.\n\n96.

Plant. 1547. cap. 53.\n\nThis grows about 8 or 10 foot high, and 6 or 7 inches diameter. The Fruit purges Choler: The Root, Bark and Leaves boil’d in Water and drank purges Phlegm; and these mixt with other things serve to cure almost all Distempers, according to the Doctrine of the Natives. S. B.\n\nThe World is very much obliged to Mr Sam. Brown for the certain knowledge of this Tree, which has hitherto lain in Obscurity, we having until now only seen the Fruit in the Shops.\n\n97. Cadal-Cungee Malab\n\nPimienta Chamberambaca Myrti Laureæ foliis fructu coronato.\n\nThis grows 6 or 7 foot high, and as thick as ones arm. The whole Plant, ground either with Milk, Tire or hot Water\nWater cures the Diabetes: it seldom fails. This sort is the best for Physick of all the 4 Cungees: S. B.\n\nMr Edward Bulkley Surgeon informs me, that a Decoction of this drank twice a day is good in the Gout and pains of the Side.\n\nThis differs from the Baccifera Madraspatana Myri Laureae foliis vix perforatis Mus. Petiver. 361. & A& Phil. N. 267. p. 711. 75. in having its Leaves thicker and less veiny, the Flowers larger, and the top of the Fruit stellated, whereas the other is pointed.\n\nThis grows also at Arcant and Pedea-paulum Arnee.\n\n98.

Malab. V. 5. Tab. 7. p. 13 & Raii H. Pl. 1572. cap. 8. very well resembles this Shrub.\n\nThe Flowers of this are yellowish in my Specimens, and not of a deep Purple, as Dr Plukenet affirms, but the Calyces when full ripe are so, which I suppose may be those the Dr calls Flowers. Dr Herman first sent me this from Ceylon, I have since receiv'd it from Viriaga patan, among those Mr Wynn Surgeon brought me. I have also had it out of the Company's Garden at Fort St George, and wild from several places thereabout, but as yet I have not seen it from any part of Africa, much less from the Cape of Good Hope, from whence Dr Plukenet says he had it. It grows 8 or 9 foot high, thick as a Mans Arm.\n\nThe Root, Bark and Leaves, either in Powder or Decoction, cures lingring or Hectick Fevers, or as these people express it, a Fever in the Bones. It's of kin to No 50. S. B. It may be join Vertue as a Pectoral, but not in kind that being an Apocynum.\n\n99.

This is a sort of Parkinsons Coru as I think: Here grows 3 sorts of this, which I send Specimens of. The Natives make Oyl of the Fruit of all these, which Cures the Dead Palsie and all sorts of Lameness: The Leaves boil'd in Water is good to bath in for the same. The Root is Milky, but the Natives here, so far as I can yet learn, use it not. The other two are call'd Corute and Peren-Corute. S. B.\n\nDr Pluket makes this the true Cyclonia e Benghala Acostae Phytograph. Tab. 170. fig. 5. We should have been obliged to him if he would have given us a figure of it from his own Specimen, rather than have copied it from the Hort. Malab. Vol. 3.

Ville-Vittree Malab.\n\nCovaalam trifoliatum minus e Madraspatan.\n\nIt's here call'd by the Portuguese Marmel da India, or Indian Quince Tree, and is the same, I believe, with Garcias\ncias his Cydonia de Bengala. 'Tis about 16 or 18 foot high, and about 8 or 10 inches diameter. A Decoction of the Leaves is a Counter-poison of the Root, purifies the Blood and corrects Choler, as the Natives phrase it: but the Fruit decocted is a Panacea in all Fluxes and Fevers.\n\nS. B.\n\nThis, were it not less, may be much rather than No Garc. 208. 104. as Dr Plukenet affirms the Cydonia de Bengala Garciae c. 14. Clus. Exot. 233. Cydonia exotica GB. 435.

Pl. 1665. c. 1.\n\nI first received the Cydonia de Bengala Garciae, &c. from that most accurate Botanist Jacobus Breynius at Dantzig, Ray 1665. sent him by Dr Herman from Zeylon; from which Island I have since had it from other hands. My ingenious Friend Mr James Cuninghame Surgeon observed it about Batavia (where Bontius also did) and says the Javians call it now Malliac; and before that he brought it me from Bengale by the name of Beel, which has some affinity with what Garcias says, viz. that in Bengale it's call'd by the Physicians only, and in their Writings Beli, but by others it's commonly known by the name of Sirifole. He also confirms what Mr Sam. Brown and the Hort. Malab. asserts, viz. that the Fruit cures Diarrhea's and Fluxes.\n\n109. Care-vail-maraum Malab.\n\nI take the Malabar-word Care or Cara to signify Black (as Care Nucheel, or Black Agnus Castus, Act. Phil. No 244. p. 319. N. 12. and confirm'd hereafter at No 121) and is, I suppose, added here to distinguish it from another species, whose Bark is red.\n\nThis, I think, is the Acacia, or Egyptian thorn, it grows 15 or 16 foot high, and about 7 or 8 inches diameter, tho I have seen it much greater up the Country. A strong Decoction of the Bark of this Tree, by washing the Teeth and\nand holding it into the mouth, cures the most rebellious Tooth-ach, as I have often experienced. The Decoction of the Root cures Fluxes: The Natives use not the Fruit, but I have made an Extract of it, of excellent use in Fluxes, and is also good in the Diabetes. S. B.\n\nAcacia globosa Orientalis siliquâ cinereâ villosâ monilis forma.\n\nHern.886. an Acacia Ægyptia Hernandez 886. Fig. vera seu spina Ægyptiaca Park. 1548. Fig. i. Acacia foliis Scorpioi-dis leguminosæ CB. 392. pl. i. Ray H. Pl. 976. i.\n\nThe pods are hoary and gray. Veslingius observes them to vary very much in their length, viz. from an inch to more than a span long, and from 3 or 4 to 8 or 10 divisions like a Necklace. This before us has xi, with one dark flattish circled seed in each. Parkinson's Figure p. 1548. taken from Veslingius is very like this Plant, and particularly the pod which he has mended, and added to it.\n\n110. Chenopodium polyspermum Orientale floribus racemiferis.\n\nThis grows about 4 foot high, and 2 fingers thick. The Natives boil and eat it. S. B.\n\n111. Balsamina aquat Indiae Oriental. fol. majore.\n\nIs about 4 foot high, branches slender; the whole Plant, ground with Water, cures the bites of venomous Insects, if the Body be rubb'd with it. S. B.\n\n112. Adundee Malab.\n\nThe Bark and Root of this, ground with Water, and a spoonful taken, cures Rheumatisms, and is good in a Gonorrhea. S. B.\n\n113. Tagada Gent. Shevada Malab.\n\nTurbith Orientalis folio cordato:\n\nan Kattu Kelengu H. Mal. V. xi. Tab. 51. p. 105.\n\nThis Climber spreads very much: I take it to be the Turbit or Tiguar of Garcias. The Natives cut this Root in pieces about 2 inches long, the better to take off the Bark,\nBark, which they put into a clean Cloath, between two Earthen Pots unglazed which shut close, the undermost being full of Milk, which they boil almost all away, that the vapour may penetrate the said Bark, which afterwards they dry in the Sun and powder it; a dram of this is a very gentle but brisk Purge, and does not gripe in the least; mixt with other things it serves them for many Distempers. S. B.\n\n114. Ashoga-maraum Malab.\n\nPanel Madraspat. fol. angustissimo mucronato fructu majore Musci Petiver 666. an Narum Panel H. Mal. V. 2. Tab. 10. p. 11. Ray H. Pl. 1636. cap. 20.\n\nThis grows 15 or 16 foot high, and 7 or 8 inches diameter. The Root and Leaves boil'd in Water, and c. 20. the sick bath'd with it, cures cold Pains and Rheumatisms. Dr Plukenet erroneously asserts these Leaves to grow opposite, and as falsely supposes it to be the Asjogam Hort. Malab. V. 5. Tab. 59. p. 117.\n\n115. Mulla-owla-maraum Malab.\n\nWaga Madraspat. Spinosa Mimosa foliis floribus parvis spicatis Musc. Petiver 700.\n\nan Acaciae genus Indianum flosculos ferens luteos racematis cohaerentes, siliquis majoribus latis planis Wawulethia Cingalensis D. Syen in H. Malab. V. 1. p. 70.\n\nThis differs from the next only in being bigger and prickly; is about 16 or 18 foot high, and 7 or 8 inches diameter. The Bark and Root ground with hot Water cures Catarrhs, Cough, and pains of the Head, S. B.\n\nI have reason to believe (having more than once observed it;) that generally where the Malabar word Mulla or Mully is applied, it signifies Thorny, as Scueli does in the Hort. Malab. as you may see in the 2d Volume Tab. 45, 6, 7 and 8, which are all like this spinose.\n\n116. Owla-maraum. Malab.\n\nWaga Madraspatana Mimosa foliis floribus parvis spicatis. Musc. Petiver. 699.\nThis grows about man high, and has the same Vertues with the last. S. B. to which Mr Bulkeley adds, that a drink of its Leaves and Bark is good in shortness of Breath.\n\n117. Aateener chedee Malab.\n\nMandaru Chamberambaca foliis rigidis venosis, subtùs pallescentibus. an Chovanna Mandaru i. Hort. Malab.\n\nVol. i. Tab. 32. p. 57. Ray 1751.\n\nThe Trunk of this is 6 foot high, set with many branches of a fathom long, which extend parallel with the Horizon, neither ascending nor descending. This is of no use in Physick; but the Natives make Ropes of the Bark, which serve instead of Match. S. B.\n\nMr Edward Bulkley tells me, a Decoction of the Leaves and Bark of this Tree being drank is good for pains in the Belly, and confirms the making of Ropes and Cables of the latter for their Country Ships. These Leaves are lesser, stiffer and more veiny than the other kinds are whitish and somewhat soft underneath; the Pods are often crooked, about an inch broad, and some of them more than a span long.\n\n118. Cheerean Malab.\n\nWaga globosa Madraspat. Mimosaë foliis, siliquâ latâ, planâ, membranaceâ.\n\nIt is about 10 or 12 foot high, and 5 or 6 inches diameter; the powder of the Bark is good, taken in hot Water, for bites of venomous Insects, the same is laxative, and stops Fluxes. S. B.\n\n119. Coadevelle Malab: Chittra-Mullum Gent.\n\nBistortæ folio minore planta, è Chamberamback.\n\nGrows a foot or two high; is good for Feavers, Pox, Itch, Scab, and Buboes; and is a chief Ingredient in many compositions for various diseases. 'Tis hot and fiery, therefore they do not take it inwardly alone, but mix\nthe powder of the Root with Butter and hot Water, an\nto take it. S. B.\n\n120. Nella-carambee Malab.\n\nJaca Madraspat. fructu Sparganii Act. Phil. No 244. p. 329. 34. where it is described. This Tree grows 30 or 40 foot high, and about 3 yards in Circumference. The pl. 34. powder of the Bark cures heat of Urine and Gonorrhea. S. B.\n\n121. Nuchulee Malab. Vairelchetto Gent.\n\nVitex Madraspat. foliis latioribus digitatis, floribus racemosis Act. Phil.

The Root, Leaves, Flowers and Fruit being ground, expels Wind, and eases all pains, even those of the Gout, as I have experienced. S. B.\n\nDr Plukenet strangely contradicts himself, in affirming this to be his Vitex Orientalis angustis foliis semper tripartito divisis. Phyt. Tab. 321. Fig. 2. whereas in this Specimen which he himself saw, there is not a pedicle with fewer than 5 Leaves or divisions on each.\n\nThere is another sort which the Natives call Cara, or black Nuchulee, because the Stalks are black, the Flowers and Fruit like the former, but less, and rises not above 4 foot high. 'Tis good for the same as the former, both being hot, cure cold pains, the whole Plant is Bitter. S.B. This is the Black Agnus Castus, or Adhatoda Madraspatana Hydropiperis folio Act. Phil.

A Decoction of the Leaves cures the Tooth-ach. (The Hort. Malab. confirms the same of the Bark.) The Fruit ground with Water and put in the Eye, cures the pain of the Head, from a cold cause. The Root cures the Itch outwardly applied. S. B.\n\nI have the late famous Jacobus Breynius his Authority, that this is the true Elengi of the Hort. Malab. and not No 90. in Mr Brown's last Book, as Dr Plukenet in his Mantissa, p. 21. falsely supposes, which he may be easily convinc'd of by comparing them together.\n\n126.

S. B.\n\nDr Plukenet makes this the Solanum somniferum verticillatum CB. 167. and says it's the Pe-Vetti Hort. Malab. Vol. 4. Tab. 55. p. 113. Ray H. Pl. 1630. Whereas the Commentator Dr Commelin rather supposes it to be the Solanum somniferum, Antiquorum Prosp. Alpin. p. 71. but I cannot think the Pe Vetti either of them, because that is a Tree, and this before us is an Herb: Besides, its Figure and Description differs from this in many particulars. There are 2 of this kind in the 10th Volume of the Hort. Malab. which it rather resembles, viz. Tab. 70 & 71.\n128.

Fig. 6.\n\nDr Plukenet in his Mantissa, p. 140. very arrogantly blames Dr Sloan for making this Plant two of his, and says it's his wonted Custom: It were to be wish'd, this modest Author did know his own Plants better, he would then give Dr Sloan and others less occasion for these just and frequent Reflections.\n\nI have received this Plant from Guinea, and several times from the East Indies, and find it to be the same with Dr Sloan's from Jamaica, and both Dr Plukenet's, which he was formerly so kind to shew me.\n\nThis eat with Rice, cures the Gonorrhea. S. B.\n\n130. Cauta cuddee Malab.\n\nCoccifera Chamberambaca Cassiae fistulae minoris folio, fructu Reniformi.\nHad that accurate Botanist Dr Plukenet but known the Fruit of the *Cocculus India*, he would not have thus erroneously attested this to be it, and at the same time to affirm the *Natsjatam* Hort. Malab. Vol. 7. Tab. 1. p. 1. to be very different from the *Coculi Indorum*, whereas that it is the same, the *Hort. Malab.* not only positively affirms, but I can prove it by Specimens I have to shew of its Leaves and Fruit, which Mr Edward Bulkley sent me from those parts.\n\nThis is a Climer, and being ground and mixt with Water, makes it ropey like whites of Eggs and clammy, which drank cures the Running of the Reins, 3 spoonfuls a Dose. S. B.\n\nPray take notice, that this Quality and Vertue is meant N. B. of the Plant before us, and not of the *Cocculus India* of the Shops, as the Doctor has unhappily attested, that being a known intoxicating Poysen: I therefore caution all people to beware of what this Physician has asserted in his pretended Correct Mantissa, p. 52.\n\n131.

I. Tab. 52. p. 97. an Arbor Indica fructu aggregato conoide Cada Pilava dicta Ray H. Pl. 1442.\n\nGrows 6 foot high, as thick as ones Arm. The powder of the Bark expels Wind, and gives a Red Dye: There are three Species of this Tree, the other two are Surra Noona and Vela Noona, both for the same use. S. B.\n\n132.

Tab. 50. p. 95.\n\nThis is Mungo of Parkinson and Garcias, and is a cooling refreshing Diet; the Moors call it Mungo, and I believe\nbelieve that which Parkinson says is kin to it, is that the Moors call Tour, which they say is hot, and therefore give it for such as hot diet is proper. Both these shake you. S. B.\n\n133. Chata-maraum Malab.\nMul.Petiv. Waga Madraspat. Minosae foliis pinnatis, filiquis maximis compressis, Mul. Petiver. 698.\n\nIs about a foot diameter, and 16 or 17 foot high; the Oyl of the Fruit by Expression cures Scalp Heads, the Root and Bark is Carminative, and expels Wind. S. B.\n\n134.

Ullarehan Malab.\nIs about a foot high, ground with Water cures Sores. S. B.\n\nWe are obliged to Dr Plukenet for informing us, that this Plant bears a spike of hexapetalous Flowers, since which that part is lost, and here is now only remaining its Grassly Leaves.\n\n136. Paule-maraum Malab. Patsjotti Zeylanica Laurocerasi folio, leviter ferrato.\n\nThis grows 6 or 7 foot high, and thick as ones Leg; the Fruit is good for Consumptions and hectic Fevers, is a little laxative; the Decoction of the Root and Bark is good for the same. S. B.\n\nThis is the same with No 98. aforegoing.\n\n137. Calle relle Malab.\nFicus Chamberambaca Ponnæ foliis, fructu parvo gemino.\n\nGrows about 6 foot high, and sometimes as thick as a mans Leg. The whole Plant in powder 3i. taken in hot Water cures internal ulcerated Piles, and is good in Ulcers of the Intestines. S. B. This chiefly differs from No 123 in having its Fruit grow by pairs without Footstalks, and the Leaves thicker and more veiny.\nTo these we add the following Animals, which our Ingenious Friend Mr Edward Bulkley, Surgeon, lately sent me from Fort St George.\n\n1. Musculus Madraspat. fluviatilis, medius intus argenteus.\n   The largest of these I have yet seen, exceed not an inch in breadth, and not quite 1½ in length; amongst them I have observed a gradual decrease to about ½ the bigness. The Shells are indifferent thick, of a dark brown on the outside, and silver within.\n\n2. Unicornu an Fluviatilis, minor Madraspat. lineis fuscis undatis.\n   This Shell runs very taper, and has about 10 twirls, the uppermost circled with many fine strie, strip’d with brown curl’d lines, the lower twirls seem cancellated or lattic’d, I have seen of these from near an inch to an inch and half long. The Mouth ½ inch wide, and one long, oval without fissure.\n\n3. Rhombus Madraspat. ex albo flavoq; mixtus, guttulis croceis circumscriptis. The Catterpillar.\n   an Rhombus gravis rostro strictiore, striis punctatis circularibus exasperatis Lib. Hist. Conchyl. lib. 4. Sect. 10. Tab. 744. Fig. 34.\n   This is a very elegant Shell, and the largest I have yet seen was with the Reverend Mr Stonestreet, which was about the bigness of Dr Lister’s Figure.\n\n4. Rhomboides Madraspat. an. ex rufo alboq; mixtus, lineis circularibus catenatis. an Rhombus cylindro pyramidali tenuis & lineis intersectis circumscriptis, clavicula acuta Lib. Hist. Conchyl. Lib.4. Sect. 10. Tab.765. Fig.14.\n   This weighs 3 drams and 36 grains: Is 2 inches and ½ long, near 1 and ¼ broad, and 3 in circumference, its mouth where widest ½ an inch.\n\n5. Rhombus Madraspat. albus parvus, macu is quadrangularibus nigricantibus fasciatis. an Rhomitus albus cylindro Pyramidali, ex nigro rufescentibus Maculis undatis\nLift H.C. tis circumscriptis Lift. H. C. L. 4. S. 10. Tab. 779. Fig. 1.4. S. 10.\nT. 779. F. 25. an Bonan. p. 27. Fig. 122. About an inch and ¼ long, 3 quarters thick, and near 3 inches in circumference, weighs almost 5ii. Mr Walter Keir Surgeon hath also observed this near the Coast of China.\n\n6. Turbo Madraspat. minor, ex albo aureoque partim reticulatus, partim nubilatus.\n\n7. Turbo Madraspat. minor, ex albo & fusco omnino reticulatus.\n\n8. Persicoides Madraspat. fasciis capillaribus.\n\nLift H.C. an Lift. Hist. Conch. L. 4. S. 10. Tab. 751. post Fig. 46.\n\n9. Unicornu Madraspat. cujus gyri maculis striisque sunt ornati. Buccinum dentatum clavícula longissima, imo quoque muricato orbe Lift. H. C. L. 4. S. 11. Tab. 846. Fig. 75. This is an elegant Shell, having each twirl, especially the bigger ones, finely streak'd and spotted. It's about 3 inches long, and weighs 3½ and 15 grains.\n\n10. Unicornu Mauritianum fascis nodosis & striatis.\n\nLift H.C. an Lift. H. C. L. 4. S. 15. Tab. 1025. Fig. 87.\n\nEach twirl is knobbed and girdled with streaks. It's near 4 inches long, and weighs almost 5x.\n\nMr Roche first brought me this from Maurice his Island (which Seamen commonly call the Morushias,) since which Mr Edward Bulkley sent it me with the aforegoing from Fort St George.\n\n11. Folliculena seu Folliculum Phalena, ovale, appendice annulo terminante e Madraspatan.\n\nThis is a wonderful Insect-Case or Coffin, form'd by some sort of Silk or Cobweb-spinning Caterpillar, but the Moth from whence it comes I cannot yet learn: Its peculiarity, which I have not observed in any other, is a pedicle with a Ring at the end of it, thro which this oval Case is fastned to the Branches and Twigs of Trees, Shrubs, &c.\n\n12. Capricornus Madraspatanus major, humero cornibusque spinosis.\nThis Goat-cheffer is 2 inches and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) long, and near one broad; on each side his Shoulder is a spine; his Vagine or Sheath-wings near this part are sprinkled with little eminencies: the Horns about 3 inches long, composed of 10 thorny genicula.\n\n13. Scara-blatta Madraspat. Vaginis punctatis.\n\nThis is of the same shape and species (and only differs in being punct like a Thimble) with a Beetle, which Moffet p. 139. hath given a good Figure of, and says it's described by Pliny acute cluna which it has, and that in Latin it's call'd Blatta fætida: this I have observed in Cellars and Vaults, but do not find it stinks like the Cock-roaches or Blatta navalis, nor domestica, which are of another Genus. I have therefore distinguished these wingless Beetles under this title.\n\n14. Scara-blatta Madraspat. 6 albis maculis insigniter guttatis.\n\nThis is an elegant Beetle, and the more rare being of the unwinged kind, like the last, of which I have not yet observed above 5 or 6 sorts. Its Horns are near an inch long, composed of 10 or 12 Coralline-like genicula, as are his feelers of 3, his upper forcipes are strong, the middle short and small, below these are his feeders, another pair which serve to carry his food to the upper forcipes or cutters. This Insect is remarkably distinguished from all others, by 4 orbicular white spots on his Vagine, and 2 oblong ones on his Shoulder.\n\n15. Scara-pecten Madraspat. niger, naso clypeato monocerato.\n\n16. Scara-pecten Guineensis niger, naso ferrato.\n\n17. Cantharis Madraspat. ruber, pedibus nigris.\n\n18. Cantharus exoticus, ex nigro aurantioque falsiatus. These differ in magnitude: I therefore take them to be of the oviparous kind.\n\n19. Cantharus minor Madraspat. niger, bimaculis luteis\n\n20. Cimex Madraspat. major, e rubro & nigredine mixtus.\n\n21. Cimex Madraspat. minor, e rubro & nigredine mixtus.\n\n22. Cimici asfinis niger, maculis ochroleucis eleganter notatus, è Madraspatan.\n\n23. Bru-\n23. Bruchus maximus, viridis, Visci alis Madraspatanus.\n24. Gryllus nigrescens bimaculatus e Smyrna.\n\nThis from Fort St George is the very same with a couple my hearty Friend Mr Samuel Daniel Surgeon brought me some years since from Smyrna, with the next, and several other very Curious Insects.\n\n25. Mantis Smyrnae gracilis, alis strictioribus.\n26. Bombylus Madraspat. nigrescens cruribus plumosis.\n27. Papilio Madraspatanus nigrescens, maculis sanguineis pallidisque interspersis.\n28. Papilio Orientalis nigrescens, duplici serie maculis sanguineis. This differs from the last in having all Scarlet spots in both the rows.\n29. Papilio Madraspat. nigrescens, maculis rubris bifariam dispositis.\n\nThis is very like the aforegoing, except that instead of the upper row of spots, they are here in a cluster.\n\n30. Papilio Orientalis caudatus nigrescens, maculis albis semicirculari. This is distinguished from others, in having a row of White Spots thro the middle of the lower wing, which to make a Semicircle is continued on the edges of the upper.\n\n31. Papilio Orientalis nigrescens macularum albarum duplici serie marginatus. This on the upper side has only 2 rows of greater and lesser specks along the lower edges, but on the other side each upper Wing has 6 specks, and lower 4 out of row.\n\n32. Papilio Orientalis, e fusco & albescente, striis maculisque mixtus. These 3 last Mr James Cuningham and Mr Charles Perry, Surgeons, brought me formerly from other parts in the East Indies, and I have since received them from Fort St George.\n\nN. B. Most of the foregoing Insects being wholly new, I shall refer you for a farther Idea of them to their Figures, which I design with other Animals and Vegetables, in the succeeding Tables of my Gazophylacium Naturae.\n\nPrinted for Sam. Smith and Benj. Walford, Printers to the Royal Society, at the Princes Arms in St. Pauls Churchyard. 1701.",
