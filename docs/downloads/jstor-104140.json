Miles, to John Eames, F.R.S. and an Account of the same, as seen by Mrs. Tennison at Canterbury.\n\nSIR,\n\nHad Yesterday the Favour of yours of the 23d Instant, for which I return you my very hearty Thanks; particularly for the Honour you put on my brief Account of the Height of the Liquors in my Thermometers,* in communicating it to the Royal Society.\n\nAs no one wishes the Prosperity of that illustrious Body more truly than I do, I should think myself happy, were I able to do any thing to promote the Design of it, or to gratify any of its worthy Members.\n\nI have inclos'd a Draught of the Parhelia seen in Kent the 19th of December last, as I took it from a private Letter sent from thence to a Gentleman in this Town: The Writer of the Letter is not so particular in his Account of it as could be wish'd: His Words were to this Purpose: \"As to the Appearance of the Mock-Suns on the 19th of December, I have inclos'd a Scheme, such as I could draw, in which you may observe S is the Sun, Z the Zenith—aa an inverted Rainbow of the most lively Colours; the Mock-Suns dd were sometimes almost too bright to look upon, and then they seem'd round,\n\n* See above, p. 20.\nbut often were fring'd (as drawn) with the prismatic Colours; the Arch \\( bb \\) was but faint, and a whitish Light in the inner Part described at \\( c \\). The Appearance ended about Noon, or rather a little before Twelve; how early the Whole was to be seen, I do not know.\n\nThe two largest Semicircles, I find no Notice taken of.\n\nOn Tuesday the 19th Instant, at 10 at Night, being the Time I generally register the Account of the Barometer and Thermometer, I found the Mercurial Thermometer abroad, at 20 Degrees above 0, or freezing Point: This I thought Extraordinary, and for that Reason I consulted my Register of last Year, and found 16 Mornings and 13 Evenings in May colder Air. And in April there were two Mornings and three Evenings only, a warmer Air. I am\n\nYour most obliged and most humble Servant,\n\nWind was West all Day 19th, and began to rise when I made the Observation, at going to Bed.\n\nH. Miles.\n\nDr.\nDr. Stukeley likewise gave in a Scheme of the same Appearance, as it was seen at Canterbury 10 h. 12 m. Dec. 19. 1741. in which the Light at c. was not taken Notice of. He copied it from a Drawing made by Mrs. Tennison, who sent it in a Letter to his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury. C. M.\n\nXIV. Experiments, by way of Analysis, upon the Water of the Dead Sea; upon the Hot Spring near Tiberiades; and upon the Hammam Pharoan Water; by Charles Perry, M.D. made on his Journey through the Holy Land, &c.\n\nExperiments (by way of Analysis) upon the Water of Asphaltis, commonly called the Dead Sea.\n\nExperiment I.\n\nUpon steeping or infusing some Scrapings of Gall in it, (after standing a long time) it turn'd of a bright purple Colour.\n\nExperiment II.\n\nUpon the Instillation of Ol. Tartari per Deliq. it immediately became troubled or muddy, and seem'd as if Goblets of Fat were fluctuating in it. This unctuous Matter, upon long standing in Repose, came",
