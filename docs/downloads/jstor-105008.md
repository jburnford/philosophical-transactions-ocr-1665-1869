CXIV. A Letter to the Reverend William Brakenridge, D. D. Rector of St. Mich. Baffishaw, and F. R. S. with a Table of the Value of Annuities on Lives, by Mr. James Dodson, Master of the Royal Mathematical School in Christ's-Hospital, and F. R. S.

Reverend Sir,

Read Dec. 16. 1756.

As I have made a great many calculations, relative to Annuities on Lives, and have otherwise contributed, as much as was in my Power, to facilitate the performance of such, I thought it, almost, a duty incumbent on me, to compute the values of them according to your curious Table of the Decrements of Life, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions; accordingly I have inclosed a table of them, and if you find it will bear examination I desire you to communicate it to the Royal Society, in order (if approved of) to its being inserted, as an appendix to your letter to the President. I am,

Reverend Sir,

Your most obedient and

most humble Servant,

Christ's-Hospital,
Dec. 8, 1756.

James Dodson.
