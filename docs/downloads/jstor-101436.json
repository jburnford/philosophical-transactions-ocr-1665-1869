Afterwards he caused it to be put into a Vessel, and covered with Spirit of Wine, thereby chiefly intending, to give good example, together with a proof, that by the help of the said spirit, (which he hath recommended for such Properties in one of his Essays of the Usefulness of Natural Philosophy) the parts of Animals, and even Monsters, may in Summer itself be preserved long enough, to afford Anatomists the opportunities of examining them.\n\nThe Head being opened, and examined, it was found,\n\nFirst, That it had no sign of any Nose in the usual place, nor had it any, in any other place of the Head, unlets the double Bagg CC, that grew out of the midst of the forehead, were some rudiment of it.\n\nNext, That the two Eyes were united into one Double Eye, which was placed just in the middle of the Brow, the Nose being wanting, which should have separated them, whereby the two Eye-holes in the Scull were united into one very large round hole, into the midst of which, from the Brain, entred one prety large Optick Nerve, at the end of which grew a great Double Eye; that is, that Membrane, called Sclerotis, which contained both, was one and the same, but seemed to have a Seam,\nby which they were joined, to go quite round it, and the fore or pellucid part was distinctly separated into two Cornea's by a white Seam that divided them. Each Cornea seemed to have its Iris, (or Rain-bow-like Circle) and Apertures or Pupils distinct; and upon opening the Cornea, there was found within it two Balls, or Crystalline Humours, very well shaped; but the other parts of it could not be so well distinguished, because the eye had been much bruised by the handling, and the inner parts confused and dislocated. It had four Eye-browes, placed in the manner express'd in Figure 4. by \\(a\\), \\(b\\); \\(a\\) representing the lower, and \\(b\\), the upper Eyelids.\n\nLastly, That just above the Eyes, as it were in the midst of the Forehead, was a very deep depression, and out of the midst of that grew a kind of double Purse or Bag, \\(C\\), containing little or nothing in it; but to some it seemed to be a production of the matter designed for the Nose, but diverted by this Monstrous Conception; perhaps the Processus mammillares joined into one, and covered with a thin hairy skin.\n\nObservables in the Body of the Earl of Balcarres.\n\nThese following Observations, were a while since sent out of Scotland by an ingenious person, an Eye-witness, to Sir Robert Moray,\n\n1. That the Belly of this Nobleman being opened, the Omentum or Net was found lean and small: his Liver very bigg; the Spleen bigg also, filled with a black and thick humour. His Stomach and Entrails all empty, of a Saffron-colour, distended with wind only. The Bladder of Gall swelled with a black humour: the Kidneys filled with a kind of grumous blood.\n\n2. That in the Thorax or Chest, the Lobes of the Lungs were all entire, but of a bad colour; on the left side somewhat black and blue, and on the right, whitish; with a yellowish knob under one of the Lobes.\n\n3.
