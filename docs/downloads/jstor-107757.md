226 13 in the 2d and 3d symbol, put 'n' for 'm'—and in the 4th, put 'p' for 'y'—in the first symbol in the bottom line, put 'n' for 'm'... and for the 3d symbol \( \frac{p}{n} \) \( C \)
227 6 for 'will' read 'will be'—line 7, in symbol, write 'm' for 'n', and for 'r' write 'r'—line 14, put 'v' in the lower angle in the right of the symbol, thus \( \frac{p}{n} \) \( a, b, c \)
228 1, 3, 4, and 11, for — where there is nothing in the lower angle, write
229 9, under the first \( \Delta \) put 'b' for 'a'—line 2 from the bottom, between 'a' and \( \frac{a}{b} \) put '+'.
231 2 from bottom, put a dash over the second T.
232 12 for 'n' put 'm'—line 13, for 'Mx' put 'M'.
233 8 for '9457' put '4597'.
236 7 for 'E' put 'E'—line 11, for 'a & c' put 'b'.
240 8 in the second formula, for 'r + i' put 'r + x'.
243 19 for 'form' put 'from'.
244 11 for 'q - x' read 'q + x'.
246 12 for last 'p' put 'q'.
247 16 include the last 'L' with the expression of line 17 in '( )'.
251 11 for 'K' write 'k'.
255 14 and 15, for '+' write '-'.

—line 10, for 'A' write 'B'.

dele '1—'.
289 1 after 'N_x =,' insert '1—,'—line 3, after 'become' insert '—,'—line 5,
at the commencement insert '—,'—line 8, after 'b' insert '—,'.
290 1 at the commencement insert '—,'—line 2, before 'r' insert '—,'—line 3,
to \(\frac{L_c - \frac{1}{2} p}{L_c}\) prefix '+' instead of '—,'—line 6, for 'with' put 'without'
—line 3 from bottom, in symbol, for 'o' write '80'—line 2 from
bottom, for 'n' put 'π'.
291 1 and 2 from bottom, dele dash above 'N.'
