stance included in the Chest, so long lasts Inspiration; but when the force of the included Air, by means of the Contraction of the Dia-
phragme and its pressure, overcomes the strength of the inspired Air,
then begins and so long lasts Expiration. So that, according to him,
Respiration is nothing else, than a Reciprocation of the Air inclosed
in the Chest, and an Alternate motion of the Lungs and the Diaphrag-
me; whereby the external Air becomes the first origin of all the A-
nimal motion.

As to the Uses of Respiration, he esteems, both from a certain Re-
lation to be found in Fontana, and from the structure, Motion and
Scite of the Diaphragme, that there are other Uses of it, than the
Cooling of the Heart, the Fanning of the Blood, the Discharge of
steams, the Conveyance of a Nitrous aliment, the Communion and
subduing of the Blood, and its intimate commixture with the Chyle,
and the promotion of the Blood from one ventricle of the heart to
the other; for all this, he faith, is perform'd by the help of the Lungs,
(which is but one Organ of Respiration:) But then he would main-
tain, that by the other Instrument of Respiration, the Diaphragme and
its Pressure, there are effected such other things, as are no less neces-
sary to the preservation of life, than the former; viz. The con-
tinual Pressure of the Chyle out of the stomach into the intestins, and
from thence by the Milky veins into the Glanduls of the Mesentery,
and so further into the Chyliferous Channel; as also the Motion of
the Blood out of the Porta into the Liver, and out of the Liver into
the Cava; and that of the Gall into the Bladder of Gall, and thence
into the common ductus and the Guts: perhaps also that thence pro-
ceeds the first Natural Instinct or Perception, exciting also the Ani-
mal motions.

Which being thus proposed and deduced by him, he endeavours to
satisfie the objections that may be made against this Hypothesis; for
which, and many other particulars, we refer to the Author himself.

NOTE,

At the end of p. 2125. the Reader is desired to add, to prevent all mi-
stakes, what the Author of that Letter signified April 21, 1671, to the Publisher,
since that was Printed, viz. That in a very sharp Frost the Bleeding is stop'd till the
weather begins to change; but in a moderate Frost, though it stop in the night, yet
in the day time, if the Sun shines out, the Trees will bleed, though the Frost con-
tinue. What we said in our Letter, Printed No. 57. p. 1166. l.45. that Cold did not
promote but hinder bleeding; we find holds true, if the Cold be without Frost.

Besides, p.2126. at the end of Mr. W. Longbby's Letter may be added, what he fur-
ther imparted in the above said Letter of Apr. 21. viz. That since his last, he had
made tryal upon Walnut and Sycamore as to the transmitting of Water, and found,
that the water runs through both but nothing so fast as thorough Birch.
