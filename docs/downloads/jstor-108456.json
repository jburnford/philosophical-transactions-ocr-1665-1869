Contributions to the Chemistry of the Urine.—Paper IV.\n\nOn so-called Chylous Urine.\n\nBy Henry Bence Jones, M.D., M.A.Cantab., F.R.S., Physician to St. George's Hospital.\n\nReceived January 21,—Read March 14, 1850.\n\nUrine white from the suspension of a quantity of fatty matter in it, has been called chylous urine, and the albumen and fibrin which escape from the blood with the fat have been considered to belong to the chyle and not to the blood.\n\nAn opportunity of observing a case of this disease having occurred to me, I was led to make the following experiments. The conclusions therefrom are,—\n\n1st. That the fat on which the white colour of the urine depends does indeed appear in the urine after the chyle is absorbed, but the albumen, fibrin, blood-globules and alkaline salts, may be found in the urine previous to any food being taken, and these substances can be made to appear in, or disappear from the urine according as the circulation is hurried by motion or quieted by rest.\n\n2nd. That the disease consists in some slight alteration in the structure of the kidney, by which, when the circulation is most active, one or more of the constituents of the blood passing through the filter escape from the vessels into the urine.\n\nThe supposition that the disease consists in an accumulation of fat in the blood which is thrown out by the kidneys carrying with it albumen, fibrin, blood-globules and salts, is altogether disproved, both by actual analysis of the blood itself, and by the frequent occurrence of a large jelly-like coagulum in the urine, when no white fatty matter can be seen to be present.\n\nFor an account of the patient and for the treatment and its ultimate effect in stopping the escape of the white water, which he had passed more or less frequently for nine months previous to my seeing him, I must refer to the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions for 1850.\n\nOn the 19th of October he came to me, having taken food last at 11 A.M. The water passed at 2 p.m. solidified like blanc mange in ten minutes. It contained, when passed from the bladder, some clots ready-formed. It was very feebly acid to test-paper. Thrown on a filter, a very small quantity of reddish streaked fibrin remained on it. The filtered fluid, at $60^\\circ$ Fahr., had a specific gravity = 1015. It coagulated by heat and acid. In appearance it was quite milky, but became clear when agitated with a considerable excess of ether. Some perfectly healthy blood-globules were seen with the microscope, and the granules of fat were so small as scarcely to be resolvable by a high power.\n574·0 grs. of urine evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid.\n\nResidue . . . . . . = 25·5 grs.\n= 44·42 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nBurnt. The ash = 4·60 grs. = 8·01 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n1015·4 grs. of urine precipitated with more than twice their bulk of alcohol.\n\nAlbumen and fat = 22·75 grs. = 22·40 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nTreated with ether. Residue soluble in ether.\n\n= 8·5 grs. fat = 8·37 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nAlbumen . . . . . . = 14·03 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n574 grs. treated with absolute alcohol after evaporation to dryness.\n\nAlcohol filtered when cold.\n\nResidue . . . = 9·02 grs. = 15·70 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nBurnt ash . . = 1·40 gr. = 2·44 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nUrea and extractive . . . = 13·26 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nHence\n\nTotal residue. = 44·42 grs. per 1000 grs. urine. Specific gravity = 1015.\n\nTotal ash . . = 8·01 grs.\n\nAlbumen . . = 14·03 grs.\n\nFat . . . = 8·37 grs.\n\nUrea, &c. . . = 13·26 grs.\n\nLoss . . . = 75 gr.\n\nWater . . . = 955·58 grs.\n\n1000·00 grs.\n\nIn order to watch the variations in the appearance of the urine at different hours of the day, it was each time passed into a bottle, marked with the hour at which it was made for five successive days.\n\nFirst day. Water passed at\n\n7 A.M. thrown away. Breakfast a pint of coffee; a quarter of a pint of milk. Bread, with little butter or sugar.\n\n8th 10th A.M., just before breakfast. Quantity one ounce, clear.

Passed on getting up. \\(513\\cdot3\\) grs. precipitated by alcohol \\(=1\\cdot85\\) gr. \\(=3\\cdot6\\) grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n8\\(^{th}\\) 10\\(^{th}\\) A.M. More milky, with large pinkish coagula; two ounces, alkaline.

Very milky, with large coagula.\n\nFrom these observations, and more particularly from the 3rd, 4th and 6th days, it is evident that the fibrin and albumen appear in the urine when no fat is perceptible, and previous to breakfast being taken, thus:\n\nThe 3rd day, 8\\(^{th}\\) 30\\(^{th}\\) A.M., the urine passed before breakfast, after he had been up an hour, was highly albuminous, and a nearly solid coagulum filled the bottle.\n\nThe 4th day, 7\\(^{th}\\) 15\\(^{th}\\) A.M., on first getting up the urine contained the slightest trace of albumen. The specific gravity \\(=1027\\). The precipitate by alcohol \\(=0\\cdot8\\) gr. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nThe 4th day, 9\\(^{th}\\) 50\\(^{th}\\) A.M., just before breakfast the urine formed a solid coagulum, and contained a visible deposit of blood. Specific gravity \\(=1015\\cdot6\\). The precipitate by alcohol \\(=14\\cdot1\\) grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nThe 4th day, 11 A.M., the urine was chylous.\n\nThe 6th day, 6\\(^{th}\\) 35\\(^{th}\\) A.M., on first getting up, the specific gravity \\(=1026\\cdot6\\).

Specific gravity \\(=1016\\cdot4\\). The precipitate by alcohol \\(=16\\cdot5\\) per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nFurther experiments on the influence of rest and motion in lessening or increasing the albumen in the urine, previous to breakfast, were then made.\n\nOn the Influence of Rest and Motion in Lessening or Increasing the Albumen in the Urine previous to and after Food was taken.\n\nSeventh day. Last food was taken at 5\\(^{th}\\) 15\\(^{th}\\) P.M. yesterday. He laid in bed this morning till 9\\(^{th}\\) 30\\(^{th}\\) A.M.\n\nUrine passed at\n\n10 P.M. Last night, milky; eight ounces.\n\n6\\(^{th}\\) 40\\(^{th}\\) A.M. Yellow, slightly milky; six ounces, acid; contained a little albumen.\n\n8\\(^{th}\\) 10\\(^{th}\\) A.M. Clear, healthy looking urine, made just before breakfast (boiled milk, a pint of sago, bread, with a little butter). The quantity, one and a half ounce.\nSpecific gravity = 1021·3. Gave no coagulum with heat and acid. 510·65 grs. precipitated by alcohol. Precipitate = 0·30 gr. = 0·6 gr. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n9th 30m A.M. Opalescent, no spontaneous coagulation. Two and a half ounces passed when he got up. Specific gravity = 1019·0. Gave a considerable precipitate with heat and acid. 509·5 grs. precipitated by alcohol.

Opalescent; one and a half ounce; feebly acid; gave a large precipitate with nitric acid and heat; contained multitudes of healthy blood-globules; no casts. On long standing gave a small bloody coagulum, which fell to the bottom of the bottle. Specific gravity = 1018·8. 509·4 grs. precipitated by alcohol. Precipitate = 0·65 gr. = 1·9 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n9 A.M. Opalescent; by 12 o'clock became a solid jelly; two ounces, alkaline. Passed just before breakfast, which consisted of a pint of milk and sago, with bread and little butter.\n\n11th 30m A.M. Coagulated spontaneously to a strong, unclear, slightly milky jelly. About three ounces, alkaline, passed in my room. Says that he thinks he can tell when the urine will be most thick and bloody by the pain, pressure and dragging, with heat in the loins.\n\nNinth, being the next day. Last food at 6 p.m. the day previous; staid in bed today until 9th 30m A.M.\n\nUrine passed at\n\n3 A.M. Cloudy, opalescent; five ounces.\n\n6th 30m A.M. Clear healthy water; an ounce and a half, highly acid. No precipitate with heat and acid.\n\n8th 40m A.M. Clear, one ounce; contained the smallest trace of albumen. Specific gravity = 1024·2. He did not sleep from 6th 30m, but he remained in bed. This water was passed just before breakfast, which consisted of a pint of boiled milk and sago, bread, with a little butter. 512·1 grs. precipitated by alcohol. Precipitate = 0·85 gr. = 1·61 gr. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n9th 30m A.M. Still clear, an ounce and a half in quantity, made on first getting up. Gave the most minute trace of albumen.

Specific gravity = 1023·4 grs. passed before breakfast. 511·7 grs. precipitated by alcohol. Precipitate = 0·40 gr. = 0·78 gr. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nEleventh day. The following morning; up early.\n\nUrine passed at\n\n8h 10m A.M. Cloudy; contained some blood-globules, but no trace of fibrinous casts; acid. Specific gravity = 1022·6; passed before breakfast. Gave a considerable precipitate with heat and acid. 511·3 grs. precipitated by alcohol. Precipitate = 9·40 grs. = 18·38 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nThe following table shows these results clearly:\n\nSeventh day. Remained in bed late.\n\n| Time       | Condition          | Specific gravity | Precipitate by alcohol |\n|------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| 8h 10m A.M.| In bed.

Remained in bed.\n\n| Time       | Condition          | Specific gravity | Precipitate by alcohol |\n|------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| 8h 20m A.M.| Urine passed before breakfast, clear | 1023·4            | 0·78                   |\n\nEleventh day.

The comparison of the 8th day with the 7th or 9th, and the great difference between the 11th and 10th days is quite conclusive. In other experiments I frequently determined before-hand whether the urine before breakfast should be albuminous or not, by directing the patient to get up and move about early or to keep very quiet in bed. And by keeping in bed all the day the urine throughout the whole day was very slightly albuminous.\n\nMDCCCL.\nIt appeared to me to be very desirable to see whether the blood was milky. Mr. Wilson, of Tavistock Street, through whose kindness the patient came to me, bled him for me. The veins were filled with blood rather longer than usual before the opening was made; the blood came in a tolerable stream. The dinner, at 1 h 30 m p.m., consisted of a mutton chop with vegetables and bread. The blood was taken at 4 h 30 m p.m. into a thin wide mouth bottle. It was left to stand fourteen hours. There was no appearance of buff or cupping. The serum was opalescent, but not at all milky; and when agitated with ether it did not become clear, and the quantity of fat dissolved in the ether was very small.\n\nBlood . . . = 1216·2 grs.\n(1.) Serum poured off = 288·5 grs. Residue on evaporation = 26·9 grs.\nHence water . . = 261·6 grs.\n(2.) Clot washed with distilled water until colourless.\nFibrin dried, in vacuo . . . = 3·20 grs.\n= 2·63 grs. per 1000 grs. of blood.\n(3.) Blood-globules, plus residue of serum, minus fibrin. . . . . . .\n= 924·3 grs.\nEvaporated to dryness . . . . . . = 261·8 grs.\nHence water . . . . . . . . = 662·5 grs.\ncontain by (1.) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 68·1 grs. of solids of serum.\nTherefore blood-globules = 261·8−68·1 = 193·7 grs. = 159·3 grs. per 1000 grs. of blood.\nTotal solids of serum = 68·1+26·9 = 95·0 grs. = 78·1 grs. per 1000 grs. of blood.\n(4.) Dried blood-globules, and serum, in the proportion of one-quarter serum to three-quarters globules, were treated with ether frequently: 99·7 grs. gave 0·25 gr., soluble in ether = 2·6 grs. of fat per 1000 grs. of dry residue.\nHence in 1000 parts of blood—\nFibrin . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2·63\nBlood-globules . . . . . . . . . 159·3\nSolids of serum . . . . . . . . . 78·1\nTotal solid residue . . . . . . . 240·03\nWater . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 759·97\nFat . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0·62\n\nThe urine made the same day on which he was bled was also examined.\nThat passed at\n6 h 30 m A.M. Clear.\n8 A.M. Slightly cloudy. Then got up and had breakfast on arrow-root.\n10 A.M. A solid and pinkish-white coagulum formed in the urine spontaneously.\n1 h 30 m P.M. Milky, with some blood and spontaneous coagula. Six ounces passed just before dinner, which consisted of a mutton chop, with vegetables and bread.\n4 P.M. Milky; five ounces.\n4th 30m p.m. Milky; one ounce, mixed afterwards with 4 o'clock water. It contained a very little blood. He was bled immediately afterwards. Four ounces of this urine were evaporated to dryness, treated with boiling water, filtered, tested with sulphate of copper and liquor potassae; gave no evidence of sugar.\n\n6 p.m. Very milky urine, with blood-globules and coagula. Specific gravity =1018; neutral to test-paper; about two ounces, made before tea.\n\n509·0 grs. evaporated, in vacuo, over sulphuric acid—\n\nResidue . . . . =28·95 grs.\n=56·87 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nAsh=5·50 . . . =10·80 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n509·0 grs., precipitated by an excess of alcohol—\n\nAlbumen and fat=10·90 grs. . . . =22·41 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\nEther dissolved = 3·8 grs. . . . = 7·46 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\nTherefore albumen . . . . . . . =13·95 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\n509·0 grs., evaporated to dryness, treated with absolute alcohol, filtered when cold—\n\nResidue=12·85 grs. . . . =25·24 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\nAsh = 0·60 gr. . . . = 1·18 gr. per 1000 grs. of urine.\nTherefore urea and extractive =24·06 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine.\n\nHence—\n\nTotal dry residue = 56·87 grs. per 1000 grs. of urine. Specific gravity =1018.\nTotal ash . . . = 10·80\nAlbumen . . . = 13·95\nFat . . . . = 7·46\nUrea, &c. . . . = 24·06\nLoss . . . . = ·60\nWater . . . . =943·13\n\n1000·00 grs.\n\nThe conclusions from these experiments are:—\n\n1st. That so-called chylous urine may contain fat, albumen, fibrin and healthy blood-globules.\n\n2ndly. That although the fat passes off in the urine after food is taken, yet the albumen and fibrin and blood-globules are thrown out before any food has been taken. During perfect rest the albumen ceases to be excreted, and it does not appear in quantity in the urine even after food is taken, provided there is perfect rest. A short time after rising early the urine may coagulate spontaneously, although no fat is present in perceptible quantity, and this may happen previous to any food.\n\n3rdly. Though the urine made just before and a short time after bleeding was as milky as it usually was at that period of the day, yet the serum of the blood was not milky. It did not contain a larger quantity of fat than healthy blood does. In other\nrespects, excepting in the diminution of the solids in the serum, the analysis of the blood corresponds with that of a case of cerebral congestion given by Andral.\n\n|                | Cerebral congestion. | So-called chylous urine. |\n|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Fibrin         | 2·7                  | 2·63                     |\n| Globules       | 152·3                | 159·3                    |\n| Solids of serum| 105·0                | 78·1                     |\n| Water          | 740·0                | 759·97                   |\n\nThe general results are—\n\n1st. That the most important changes in the urine take place independently of the influence of digestion.\n\n2ndly. That the urine in one respect only resembles chyle, and that is in containing, after digestion, a large quantity of fat in a very fine state of division; but the excess of fat in the urine is not caused by any excess of fat in the blood, for no excess of fat was found there.\n\n3rdly. It appears that some change is produced in the kidney by which fibrin, albumen, globules and salts are allowed to pass out whenever the circulation through the kidney is increased: if, at the same time, fat is present in the blood, it escapes also into the urine.\n\nThat this change of structure is not visible to the naked eye on post mortem examination of the kidneys, Dr. Prout long since demonstrated; and in a case of this disease, which was in St. George's Hospital, and was examined at Plymouth, no disease of the kidney was observed. From the total absence of fibrinous casts of the tubes from this urine, it is not improbable that by the microscope a difference may be detected in the structure of the mammary processes rather than in that of the cortical part of the kidney.",
