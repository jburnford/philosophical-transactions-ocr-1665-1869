The Glass-Maker blows them, and lets them cool, without putting them again into the Oven. And, from the Experiments, I take notice, that what is capable of breaking them ought to have some Roughness: And I am told that a Grain of River-Sand will break them.\n\nThe first Opportunity I shall send you two or more of these Bottles; and am, &c.\n\nX. A Letter from Mr. Tho. Wright to James Theobald, Esq; F. R. S. concerning Two ancient Camps in Hampshire.\n\nRead Feb. 7. LAST Summer, during my Stay in the West of England, common Report, and my own natural Curiosity, led me to a Place in Hampshire called Buckland Castle, or, more vulgarly, the Rings; where I found two neighbouring Camps\nCamps about three Furlongs asunder: The one very strong, with double Ditches, and triple Vallums, upon the Top of an Hill, three Ways guarded by a natural Ascent; the other upon a lower Ground, close by a River (which defends it on one Side), with a Ditch and Vallum half round, and a kind of Morass on the other. The first contains about ten Acres; the latter about seven; and the Land lying betwixt them is, and has been time out of Mind, called Ambrose Farm: Besides an Arm of the River, or rather of the Sea (it being Salt-Water), running close up to the latter, is called Ambrose Dock.\n\nFrom all which it appears not improbable, that this may have been a principal Station belonging to Aurelius Ambrosius.\n\nThe inclos'd is a true Representation both of their Form and Situation (see Tab. II. Fig. 2, 3.): The large one is about a Mile from Limington; and, cross the River opposite to the Town, and facing the South-east Angle of it, is an artificial Hill, known by the Name of Windmill Nap; which I take to have been a Beacon, by reason it commands almost all the Isle of Wight, the full Passage of the Needles, and great Part of the there level Champagne, besides the Camp itself.\n\nCamden (tho' he takes no Notice of these Camps, yet mentions one of much less Consequence, about twelve Miles Distance, called Castle-Malwood) says, \"It is most certain, that, about the Year 508, Aurelius Ambrosius had here many Conflicts with the Saxons, with various Success.\" But, again, the People of this Country have a Tradition, That, three Miles to the West of this Camp, a famous Battle was\nwas fought betwixt the Saxons and the Danes; in which so much Blood was spilt, that a little River is said to have run Blood, now called from thence Danes Stream.\n\nYour Friend, and\n\nOxenden-Street, Jan. 12.\n1744.\n\nHumble Servant,\n\nTho. Wright.\n\nXI. Observations on a Case published in the last Volume of the Medical Essays, &c. of Recovering a Man Dead in Appearance, by distending the Lungs with Air. Printed at Edinburgh, 1744; by John Fothergill, Licent. Coll. Med. Lond.\n\nRead Feb. 21, 1744-5. Now printed with Additions.\n\nTHERE are some Facts, which, in themselves, are of so great Importance to Mankind, or which may lead to such useful Discoveries, that it would seem to be the Duty of every one, under whose Notice they fall, to render them as extensively public as it is possible.\n\nThe Case which gives Rise to the following Remarks, I apprehend, is of this Nature: It is an Account of \"A Man, dead in Appearance, recovered by distending the Lungs with Air; by Mr. William Tossack, Surgeon in Alloa;\" printed in Part 2. p.605. Vol. V. of the Medical Essays, published by a Society of Gentlemen at Edinburgh; an Abstract of which will\n",
