EXPLANATION OF THE COLUMNS.

1st, THE date (a).

2d, The height of the thermometer, according to FAHRENHEIT's thermometer belonged to Mr. RUSSELL, and hung in the open air in the balcony.

3d, including four columns, contains the register of the marine barometer which, as well as the thermometers, were made by NAIRNE and BLUNT: the R and D are quicksilver, of the kind usually made by them. That marked S is of quicksilver, and of a lighter fluid, for the purpose of making the alteration visible, which is a very great convenience at sea; a quicksilver thermometer being used for the sake of correcting its height, the heat by which is set down in marked Th. next to that marked S.

4th, The weather and winds in four lines; 1st line from noon to 6 p.m.; 2nd, from 6 p.m. to midnight; 3rd, from midnight to 6 a.m.; 4th, from 6 a.m. to noon.

In the column of weather, f. denotes fair; sq. squally; c. cloudy; h. hazy; b. hard rain; sr. small rain; dr. r. drizzling rain; fh. showers; th. thunder; l. lightning.

It is proper to remark, that the winds are set down according to the compass, allowance for the Variation.

5th in 2, The difference between the daily alteration of latitude by account; N. denoting that the observation was to the Northward of the account; was to the Southward (b).

(a) Here, for want of room, the day of the month only is expressed; but in the original journal the days of the Moon, are also inserted.

(b) Next to these columns in the original journal are the following, which are left out here only for want of space:

Correct course, lee-way variation &c. allowed, and the different courses reduced to one straight course.
Distance on that straight course.
Difference of latitude by account,
Difference of latitude by observation,
The departure,
The difference of longitude by account,
The difference of longitude by the time-keeper,

in minutes of a degree.

* D d d 2
The difference between the daily alteration of longitude by the account and W. denoting that the longitude by the time-keeper was to the Westward of that it was to the Eastward.

The result of those differences indicates the daily effect of current; however an average course failed, or distance run by log, would make the current appear different from what it really was.

The longitude from Greenwich, in seven columns.

The longitude by account.

The longitude by the time-keeper, which was made by Arnold, but without any late improvements.

The difference between the longitudes deduced from observations of the Moon from the time-keeper uncorrected; E. denoting the time-keeper to be to the East of C; W. denoting time-keeper to West of C. This, admitting the time-keeper not to be liable to any sudden changes in its rate of going, indicates the precision with which the observations of the Moon may be relied on, all circumstances of weather and of the ship's motion considered.

The longitude by observations of the Moon's distance from the Sun or Stars, adjusted, by the log, to the noon nearest the time of observation.

The number of sights or distances observed.

The object whose distance from the Moon was observed; O denoting the Sun; R. the Star; S. Spica Virginis; R. Regulus; A. Aldebaran; At. Atair; P. Pollux; T. Comalhaut; An. Antares.

The extreme difference between the highest and lowest observation; expressed in minutes of a degree; when the seconds amount to more than 30, the next minute above is taken, otherwise the next minute below.

The latitude in two columns:

The latitude by account, carried on from the land, in the same manner as the longitude by account.
2d, The latitude by observation; and where the latitude could not be observed by observation, it is deduced by account from the last observation, in which it is included within [ ].

9th, The correct longitude from Greenwich deduced from the time-keeper, by the sight of lands, whereof the longitudes are known, and by observations of taking a mean of the several observations of the Moon made within a short period other. The error of the time-keeper, between the longitude corrected by sight observations of the Moon, is supposed to have arisen by the time-keeper having rate of going uniformly between these observations; and the intermediate longitudes determined by the time-keeper on this supposition. Where no observations were made, it is deduced by the account from the last observation of the longitude is then included within [ ].

10th, The magnetical observations of the variation and dip, in seven columns:

1st, The variation by azimuth, * before, denoting the observation to have been in the morning; * after, denoting the observation to have been in the evening. The variation was observed by the official compass belonging to the ship.

3d, The dip with the face of the instrument to the East.

4th, Ditto, ditto, ditto, West.

5th, The mean dip of the foregoing observations.

6th, The mean corrected, or what is supposed to be the true dip.

7th, The circumstances under which the observations of the dip were made.

12th, The miles run by log.

The dip was observed with a dipping-needle belonging to the hon. Mr. Sisson.

The following remarks on the dipping-needle and observations are by Mr. C. A.

The ends of the axis of the dipping-needle are made conical, and turn in a ring of bell-metal, in the manner of Mr. Lorimer's needle, described in Phil. Trans. vol. LXVI. p. 396. The dip was constantly observed both with the face of the instrument to the East and to the West, and the poles were changed twice during the voyage, in order whether the needle continued well balanced. The use of this method of observation is explained in Phil. Trans. vol. LXVI. p. 396.
The mean dip corrected is what is supposed; the correction is as follows.

By the observations on July 12th, when the marked end of the needle was too heavy, and too low at that place; and therefore, if we suppose the error in the dip to be strong in all parts of the earth, the error will be 1/6th of a degree as the cosine of the dip. The poles were changed at Suez, agree with all the observations the marked end of the needle was altered; and all that part of the voyage subsequent to that alteration.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{of a degree from the mean dip,} \\
\text{when the mean dip is between} \\
\end{align*}
\]

But as before the needle left London, there was a difference in the dip, the correction in that case is great, *videlicet*;

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{8} & \quad \text{of a degree is subtracted from the dip, when that} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The dip was observed on board the Grenville, in the part of the ship in which the observation was made more than 5' from that observed with the needle about five miles distant; so that the observation was much influenced by the iron-work of the ship.
The mean dip corrected is what is supposed to be the true dip. The foundation of this supposition is as follows.

Observations on July 12th, when the poles were changed, it appears, that the end of the needle was too heavy, so as to make that end point \(\frac{1}{16}\)ths of a degree from that place; and therefore, if we suppose that the force of magnetism is equally distributed over all parts of the earth, the error produced thereby in other places should be to the degree as the cosine of the dip to the radius. The observations also made when the poles were changed at Suez, agree well enough with this supposition: therefore, as in those observations the marked end of the needle pointed to the North, the mean dip in the part of the voyage subsequent to July 12th is corrected by subtracting

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{degree from the mean dip,} & \quad \begin{cases} 
63^\circ \text{ and } 52^\circ \\
52^\circ \quad 43^\circ \\
43^\circ \quad 30^\circ \\
30^\circ \quad 0^\circ 
\end{cases} \\
\text{when the mean dip is between} & \quad \begin{cases} 
70^\circ \text{ and } 62^\circ \\
62^\circ \quad 52^\circ \\
52^\circ \quad 43^\circ \\
43^\circ \quad 35^\circ \\
35^\circ \quad 30^\circ \\
30^\circ \quad 25^\circ \\
25^\circ \quad 0^\circ 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\]

North, and adding as much when the dip is as much South.

Before the needle left London, changing the poles was found to make very little difference in the dip, the correction in the preceding part of the voyage is made not so great;

It was observed on board the Grenville at Deptford, after her return, in the same ship in which the observations were usually made, and was found not to differ much from that observed with the same needle in a pretty large garden in London, two miles distant; so that the observations on board the Grenville seem to be not much influenced by the iron-work of the ship.

Decreasing breezes. Changed log-line 48 feet to 29°.

Most part light airs. Several small land birds; two of them, supposed nightingales came on board, very tired; also saw a hawk.

Light airs of wind Easterly, with calms. Some swallows and other land birds, who seem very tired. In the afternoon, during the calm, when the ship's head was to the Southward, there was, for a little time, a counter current visible; it made like a wake on the ship's larboard beam, as if she was going broadside foremost.

Light airs of wind throughout. P.M. saw two three-mast vessels with lateen sails; they were supposed to be Barbary cruisers, but did not come near enough to let us know what they were. Some swallows about the ship.

An increasing breeze from the Northward. In the morning there were many petrels in the ship's wake: they continued throughout the day.

Fresh breezes, with some squalls. At noon saw Porto Santo from the mast-head, W by S. per compass.

In Funchal road. Major Sears informed us, that Mr. Sears, in consequence of our request, tried the therm. for 30' in a cool cellar, and found it 68°. N.B. Captain Alcock informed me, he observed the therm. on May 14, 1776, at 6 A.M. at Funchal 68°, and in the cellar 61°; and Mr. Sears wrote to Mr. Cavendish, that on the 16th of May the therm. which stood at 69°, was carried down at 1 P.M. to a cellar, where it remained till 4 o'clock, and then was found to be at 62°, so that Major Sears's account was probably erroneous.

First part, light airs. Middle and latter, pleasant breezes and smooth weather; several boats came off from Funchal.

These 24 hours pleasant breeze from Eastward.

T.S. denotes the temperature of the sea-water taken up in a bucket about noon, and the thermometer immersed in this bucket for some minutes.

53 Light breezes and smooth water At noon, Peak of Tenerif S 50° E.

Pleasant breezes from the Eastward. At noon, Peak of Tenerif (variation allowed) bore N 24° 36' E., which bearing, and the difference of latitude places it 27° to the Eastward of our situation at noon, when in 16° 55' long., by time-keeper, and consequently by time k. 16 28 is the longitude of Peak of Tenerif, only 4' less than Percival makes it; but, by the observations of the Moon, on the 21st and following days, it appears, the ship was 1° farther West than the time-keeper represented, which difference arose since the 9th of May, if the Lunar observations were to be relied on.

70 Light breezes and smooth water throughout. Several petrills in the wake.

106 Pleasant trade. In Captain Exeter's chart there being foundings laid down not far to the Eastward of our situation, founded at 8 P.M. but had no ground 40 fath. Several petrills in the wake of ship.

87 Light breezes with smooth water throughout. Many petrills.

N.B. There was apparently an error in this day's log, by time-keeper. The succeeding days diff. long. was as much less as this day's was more than account. I have here corrected it as conformable to the Lunar observations. T.S. 69°.

115 In the evening, the water appeared of a muddy green, like foundings; but did not found. An increasing trade with fair weather, the water continuing of same colour. T.S. 69°.

153 These 24 hours a fresh trade, and mostly fair weather, the water remaining the same as before. T.S. 68°½.

150 Fresh trade and hazy weather. In the afternoon the sea remarkably confused, breaking different ways. Sounded in the morning, but had no ground 40 fath. In the morning the water appeared blue again. T.S. 71°.

Light breezes chiefly. In the night, no ground 70 fath. There were many blubbers in the ship's wake, which made a very luminous appearance; they seemed in shape like a sausage about 8 or 9 inches long. In the day, tea was covered with Portuguese men of war, of which took up several; also some pilot-fish and skip-jacks. T.S. 74°.

| 81 | Mostly fresh breezes. At 10½ A.M. there was to the SE. the appearance of something black like a rock, and at the same time like a shoal; but it being to windward, and ship having fresh way, could not determine whether it was a shoal or the reflection of the Sun behind the clouds. This is nearly the situation of the Ouro. A man sent to mast-head could not see any thing. Bar. 2 P.M. 29.84. 9. 29.84. 12. 29.84. |
| 82 | Most part the wind Easterly, with some squalls towards the latter end. Bar. 1 A.M. 29.9. 8. 29.94. |
| 61 | Winds variable with unsettled weather. P.M. a bird like a land bird. A.M. many yellow tails; two black birds at a distance like land birds; a white bird with black wings, like a gull. Bar. 2 P.M. 29.84. 4. 29.84. 9. 29.9. 12. 29.9. |
| 8 | Light airs and calms, with hard rain. Many fish, porpoises, &c. A.M. a mottled grey bird of the booby kind. The O's limb not distinct when longitude observed. Bar. 2 P.M. 29.84. 12½. 29.84. 7½ A.M. 29.84. 8½. 29.94. |
| 28 | Winds and weather very unsettled. P.M. a sea bird like a plover; many fish. P.M. caught a shark. A.M. saw a sail. Bar. 2 P.M. 29.84. 4. 29.84. 12½. 29.9. 8 A.M. 29.94. 11½. 29.9. |
