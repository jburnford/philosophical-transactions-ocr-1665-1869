MEMO
MEMORANDA.

The body of the observatory (erected at the Cape) was circular, the radius of which 6½ feet in the clear; the height of the circular wall 5½ feet; the roof conical, and moveable, (made of board) a lid in it of 3 feet breadth, to open, which was easily turned to any part of the heavens, as the whole top moved freely.

The clock was fixed against two pieces of timber (let near 4 feet into the ground) of 10 inches by 8; these pieces being joined together by pins of 1½ inch diameter.

The mean of Fahrenheit's thermometer, as it stood at 6 or 7 in the morning, noon, 1 or 2h after, and 7 or 8 in the evening.

At 47 upon 18th July, in the morning, and 69 the 1st and 14th of September, in the afternoon. These were the greatest differences I saw.

June 6th, at the end of the transit, 55.

Note. Those observations marked : are a little dubious.
Those marked :: are very dubious.
The transit was observed with the power that magnified 120 time.
The eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter with the same power.
The adjustment of the nonius of
the micrometer, thus

Mean = 0.52 = 0.4 to be
added to the observed angle, it falling to the left hand of 0.

Hitherto the clock stood on a lower floor, near to the place intended for the observatory; and the observatory being now finished, I put the clock into it, wound up the pendulum, and set it to nearly sidereal time.

No observations were made material to June 5th, it being cloudy near all the time; but the 5th, in the evening, it fortunately cleared up.

N. B. The adjustment of the nonius of the micrometer as upon the 17th May.

When I saw the planet first, its periphery, and that of the Sun's, were in a great tremour; but this vanished, as the Sun rose, and became well defined.

Four minutes before the internal contact, the Sun's disk was entirely hid by a cloud, for about one minute.

The instruments made use of, in these observations, were,
Two reflecting telescopes, each two feet focal length, and magnifying 120 times,
made by Mr. Short.
A quadrant of one foot radius, made by Mr. Bird, and the property of the Earl
of Macclesfield.
An astronomical clock, made by Mr. Ellicott.

APPENDIX.

Eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, observed at the Royal Observatory
at Greenwich, with a reflector of two feet focus, magnifying
95 times.
