the West, I saw two small long Clouds, which interposed
betwixt me and the light Streams; which I saw a-
bove the Clouds, and betwixt them, which convinc&#x27;d
me that this Light (whatever it be) is far above them.
I have drawn a Scheme of the whole Horizon, as it
appear&#x27;d to me. (See the Figure.) That bright Star is
Jupiter, whose Place then was $17^\circ$ in Aries, and was
about South-West, I guess about $20^\circ$ high. Some
of the brightest Stars in Taurus, Orion, and Aries ap-
pear&#x27;d South and South East; but I have not placed
those but by guess. In this state I left it: But was
told by one that saw it after Ten o&#x27; Clock, that the
whirling Light in the Zenith appeared of several Co-
lours, as, blue, green, yellow, and reddish. But that
I did not see.

V. A Letter from the Reverend Mr. Edmund
Barrel, Rector of Sutton near Dartford in
Kent, to Sir Hans Sloane, Baronet, concern-
ing a Shock of an Earthquake felt in that
Neighbourhood, &amp;c.

SIR,

Sutton, Aug. 11th, 1727.

I had an Information brought to me Yesterday, on
purpose to be communicated to your Society;
&#x27;twas, that the Earthquake was felt very sensibly at a
Farm on a Hill called Skeat-Hill, which is at the West
End of Lullingstone-Park, belonging to Percival Hart,
Esq;
Esq; about 8 Miles South-West from Dartford: And the same Morning a Piece of Ground, in a Meadow in Farningham, about five Miles South of Dartford, fell in, so as leave a Pit about 8 or 10 Feet over and near as deep; and being on the same level with the River, it was (when seen that Morning) fill&#x27;d with Water, within 3 or 4 feet of the Top; tho&#x27; that Spot of Ground, was supposed to have been as sound as any about it, Carts having many times gone over that very place. I thought it not improper to trouble you with this, supposing, that the Curious, will be pleas&#x27;d to hear how far the Shock of the Earthquake was felt.

P. S. In my Letter about Mistleto, I mentioned a visible Proof, that there always was a germinating Principle in the Seeds of this Plant, whenever the Berries remained on their Boughs till May. The Birds do not often permit any such to be found; but as I have formerly observed this, so I have met with some this Year, whereof I have herewith sent you a Specimen; wherein you will find both old ripe Berries and young green Ones, on the same Stalks; and in the old you may see (even through their Skin) the little Germen putting forth its Head from the Seed or Kernel. I have likewise formerly had a Suspicion that the Plants of Mistleto are some Male, some Female: I am now further persuaded, that it may be so; and if this be confirmed by my future enquiries I will make bold to give you an Account of it.

I am, &amp;c.
