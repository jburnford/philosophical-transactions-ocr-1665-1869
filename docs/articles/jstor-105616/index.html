XXXIX. An Account of the Observations
made on the same Transit in Sweden: In
a Letter from Mr. Peter Wargentin, Se-
cretary to the Royal Academy of Sciences in
Sweden, and F. R. S. to Mr. John Ellicot,

Stockholm, Aug. 7, 1761.

In a letter, dated June 8th, I commu-
nicated to Dr. Birch, Secretary to the
Royal Society, my observations upon the transit of
Venus. Having since received some other good ob-
servations of this phænomenon, I thought the com-
municating them to you, would give you some plea-
sure.

At Torneo in Lapland, Messieurs Lagerborn and
Hellant very happily observed both the entrance and
exit of Venus, with telescopes of 32 and 20 feet focal
lengths. The principal times observed were as fol-
lows:

Exterior
Exterior contact at the entrance. | Interior contact at the entrance. | Interior contact at the exit. | Total exit.
---|---|---|---
Lagerborn | 3 45 44 | 4 4 1 | 9 54 22 | 10 12 18
Hellant | 3 45 51 | 4 3 59 | 9 54 8 | 10 12 22

Mr. Hellant is esteemed a very good observer. The difference between the meridians of Paris and Torneo, is computed to be $1^h 27&#x27; 28&#x27;&#x27;$, very nearly.

At Abo, the capital of Finland, situated in latitude $60^\circ 27&#x27;$, longitude east of Paris $1^h 19&#x27; 17&#x27;&#x27;$, Mr. Ju-stander observed with a telescope of 20 feet;

The interior contact, at the entrance to be at $3 55 50$
Beginning of the exit, at $9 46 59$
Total emersion, at $10 4 42$

At Hernosand, a city in Sweden, in latitude $60^\circ 38&#x27;$, and longitude $1^h 2&#x27; 12&#x27;&#x27;$ east of the meridian of Paris, Messieurs Gifter and Strom observed, with telescopes of 20 feet.

Mr. Gifter | 3 38 26 | 9 29 21 | 9 46 40
Mr. Strom | 3 20 40 | 3 38 35 | 9 46 47

At the observatory at Upsal, Messieurs Strömer, Metlander Mallet, and Bergman, made the following observations, with three telescopes of 20 feet, and a reflector of 18 inches. The difference of meridians between Upsal and Paris is $1^h 1&#x27; 10&#x27;&#x27;$.
At Lund in Scanie, Mr. Schenmark observed, with a telescope of 21 feet. The interior contact of the exit was $9^h\ 10&#x27;\ 44&#x27;&#x27;$, doubtful, being cloudy; total emersion $9^h\ 29&#x27;\ 14&#x27;&#x27;$. This city is $43&#x27;\ 50&#x27;&#x27;$ to the east of the meridian of Paris.

According to the observations made at the observatory at Stockholm, by Mr. Klingensierna and myself;

The difference of meridians between Paris and Stockholm is $1^h\ 2&#x27;\ 50&#x27;&#x27;$ or $52&#x27;&#x27;$, at most.

In these observations, I made use of an excellent telescope, of 21 Swedish feet, and Mr. Klingensierna observed with one of Mr. Dollond&#x27;s telecopes, of 10 feet, with an eye-glass fitted to it, which magnified the object more than 140 times.

In comparing these observations together, you will perceive, that they do not agree so near as was hoped for; and those which were made at Paris, agree but little better. I should be very glad to hear how the English observers have succeeded, both at London, and at St. Helena; I therefore desire you would procure for me those observations, which have been communicated to the Royal Society, to whom you may present
present these from Sweden, if you think them deserving your notice, which I hope you will.

I have the honour to be,

With the most perfect esteem,

SIR,

Your most obedient

humble servant,

Wargentin.

XL. Observationes Veneris sub Sole visae, habitae Parisiis, die 6° Junii 1761, in palatio Luxemburgi, quas Regiae Societati Londiniensi, venerationis suae obsequium, offert Hieronymus De la Lande, Acad. Reg. Scient. Parisinae Socius, Regiusque Mathematicos Professor.

Read Nov. 19, 1761.

Nubes in oriente persistentes ab horâ quartâ usque ad septimam vitum Solis rapuerunt, earumque intervalla unicum observationem permiserunt, quae sequitur, cum sextante hexapedali factam.
