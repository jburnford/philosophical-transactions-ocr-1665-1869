<h2 data-pagefind-ignore>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">by these Concretions the connate Acidum so combines with the Sulphurous parts it closeth with, as that both pass into a tertium quid, or neutral result, partaking of both, and yet distinguishable by neither; insomuch that the Acidum by such sort of coagulations and concretions looses its sting, and becomes altogether unperceivable: Whence he draws the reason, why, though Acids be the very foundation of all coagulations and concretions of bodies, yet are themselves to our taste in many things the least discoverable: Which particular he endeavours to make out by artificial mixtures, resembling the natural, seeing we cannot easily get to the insides of bodies in their natural productions.

As to his discourse of the Sulphur-Bath at Knarsborough in Yorkshire, concerning its Causes and Vertues, we shall refer the Reader to the Tract itself.
