<h2 data-pagefind-ignore>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">Pliny, Rondelatus, Gesner, Johnston, or Aldrovandus, or any other of the ancient or modern Haliucatical writers. All is found Philosophy, Art and Nature, matter of Fact and confirmed by much experience.

These his Instances (amongst many others of note) are peculiarly remarkable: That the stately Hart, p. 24; the fearful Hare, p. 40; and the cunning Otter, p. 56, have (all of them) as many deep Subtilties and crafts, to make the dogs leave the Chase, as any old Fox, 49: That a Hare doth naturally know the change of Weather from 24 hours to 24 hours, p. 39: That Fish do foreknow the approach of a shower of rain, and will then forbear to bite; by which Observation, upon the rising of a Cloud, he hath often saved himself from being wet to the skin, p. 249: That the Char, a delicate Fish, resembling a Trout, is only to be found in the great Lake of Lancashire called Winander mere, p. 257: That the Guinead, another excellent Fish, is only to be found in a large water, called Pemble-mere, through which the River Dee runs: Dee aboundeth with Salmons, and Pemble-mere with Guineads; yet was it never known, that any Salmon was caught in the Mere, nor any Guinead in the River; Quare p. 266: That a Pike, the Tyrant of Fresh-waters, fought with an Otter, for a Carp taken; bit a Mule by the lip, as he was drinking; bit a Maid by the foot, as she was washing; and frequently devours his own kind, p. 269; yet will do no injury to the Tench, the Fishes famous Physician: And when the Pike is sick or hurt, he applies himself to the Tench, and finds cure by rubbing himself against him; Quare p. 278: That the Eyrie of a Peregrine or Haggard-Falcon was never yet found in any Country, by any man, that he could ever hear or read of, p. 122: That she takes a large Liberty to her self, for her abode, either by Sea, or Land, and is so absolute in her power, that all flying-Fowl stoop under her Subjection; nay, that the Teircel-gentle, which is her natural Male, dares not sit by her, or come near her residence, but only in cawking Time, and that is in the Spring; and then, for procreation sake, she will admit him to come near her with Submission, which he manifests with bowing his head at his approach, and by calling, and cowring with his Wings, as the young ones do; in testimony how fearful he is of incurring her displeasure, p. 82: That this generous Falcon flies to such a height, that being lost to the sight of Mortals, she seems to converse with heaven alone; yet such is her loyalty and obedience to her Master, that a word from his mouth shall make her stoop and condescend, p. 75. Thus much extracted only for a Taste of the Philosophy of Animals; of the Providence, Wit, and wiles of Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, &amp;c. to secure their own safety; and (on the other side) the courage, sagacity, gallantry, fidelity and obedience of Dogs and Hawks, to serve Mankind in the acquirement of his Dominion and Sovereignty over the Land, the Waters, and the Air; as a touch at some of their peculiarities.
