I doubt not there are many Gentlemen of the Society, who can give a better Account of the Torques than I can. If, for your own Satisfaction, you have a mind to be further informed of the Use of it among the Antients, you may, I believe, find it in a Treatise written by one John Schefferus, de Antiquorum Torquibus, which is printed in Graevius&#x27;s Collections, but I have not the Book here.

I have not forgot the Oil or Scum which floats on the Sea about Midsummer, and will endeavour to have some saved the next Season.

I am, Sir,

Your most humble Servant,

Tho. Mostyn.

IX. A Letter from Benj. Cooke, F. R. S. to Peter Collinson, F. R. S. giving an Account of the Fire-ball seen Dec. 11. 1741.

Dear Sir,

Newport, in the Isle of Wight, Jan. 25. 1741-2.

I Did not see the Phenomenon (the Fire-ball seen Dec. 11. 1741.) you mention*; but a Gentleman of my Acquaintance was

* See in this Transaction p. 1.
on an Hill about three Miles West of this Town, and had a very advantageous View of it.—He says, that at that Time the Brightness of the Sun was a little obscured by the Interposition of some thin Clouds, when he saw it pass by to the Eastward, at about the Distance of something more than a Quarter of a Mile, and apparent Height of 30 Feet above the Level of the Place were he stood. Its Colour was that of a burning Coal; its Figure a Cone, whose Length might be eight Feet, and Diameter at the Base 18 Inches. From about its Apex, which was its hinder Part, issued several bright Streams sparkling with fiery Drops, to the Length of about four or five Feet, something after this manner

—Its Motion was nearly parallel to the Plane of the Horizon, and its Direction (as near as we can find by comparing the Places it passed over) from South-west by South to North-east by North, without any Noise, Wind, or Motion of the Earth attending it.—The Time of its Appearance did not happen to be taken Notice of with the desired Exactness; but by the best Observation we can make, must be about a Quarter before One o’Clock at Noon.—There were a few others who saw it, to whom it appear’d different in Shape, according to the Point it was seen from; and perhaps its Shape might change as it became nearer consuming, and only its Head, in the Form of a Bell, remain at last.—As this was the first Land it happen’d to make on this side the Chanel, I should be glad to know if any Accounts can be got of it Abroad, and what the Learned think of it; and shall think
think it a great Happiness, if this Relation may be of any Use or Satisfaction. I am,

SIR,
Yours most obliged and most affectionate,

B. Cooke.

X. An Account, by Mr. John Eames, F. R. S. of a Book intituled, Jacobi Theodori Klein Historiae Piscium Naturalis promovendae Missus primus Gedani, 1740. 4to. Or, The first Number of An Essay towards promoting the Natural History of Fishes, by Mr. Klein, Secretary of Dantzick, and F. R. S.

Read Feb. 4. Although the Natural History of Animals has been vastly improved, since several of the worthy Members of the Royal Society, both at Home and Abroad, have taken it under their Consideration; yet there still remain some things to be known, in order to render it full and complete. As particularly, concerning the Hearing of Fishes, it is remarked, that in no Fishes beside the Cetaceous Kind, have hitherto been found any Auditory Passages, or Ear-holes; and whether all Fish hear or no, is a Question not yet fully determined, notwithstanding the Experiments alledged to prove the Affirmative.</div>
