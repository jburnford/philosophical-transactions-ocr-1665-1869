To be short, his Majesty soon gave to all the Kingdom, in St. James&#x27;s Park, and Hide Park, in the Approaches to his fairest Palaces, and in his Forrests, Illustrious Patterns for the best Improvements, and for a copious Variety of all kinds of Amaranities. Now when our idle Multitudes shall be strongly inured to those innocent and profitable Employments, till all our Hills, which are now bald, shall be shelter&#x27;d with the Chesnut, the Beech, the Pine, Box, Maple, and the Royal Oak; and all our Valleys adorn&#x27;d with the fruitful Knots of Cyrus, and like the golden Gardens of Alcinous; then shall we have fair grounds to hope for the blessings of Peace and Plenty, and the Juncture of sound and usefull Philosophy with Christian Charity; and of true Religion and Piety with cheerful Loyalty; and then we shall truly deserve the Old Style of the Fortunate Islands, and the Gardens of Hesperides.
