V. A Letter from John Bevis, M.D. to John Machin, Esq; Secret. R.S. &amp;c. containing some Observations concerning Mercury.

SIR,

Presented May 4. 1744.

THE Observations to which the inclosed Computations are made by Mr. Morris from somewhat more correct Elements than those in Dr. Halley&#x27;s Tables, were carefully taken by myself, with an excellent astronomical Sector of five Feet Radius. You will perceive how far I am limited, by my Friend&#x27;s Request; so must intreat you, if you think it worth while, to inform the
the Royal Society, that Mercury&#x27;s Motion has not been at all disturb&#x27;d, [by the late Comet] to do it in what manner you shall think best. I am,

SIR,

Your obedient,

Wednesday, May 23.

1744.

humble Servant,

J. Bevis.
