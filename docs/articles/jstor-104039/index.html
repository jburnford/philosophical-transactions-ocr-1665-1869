<div class="ocr-text">Addend. to the Note at p. 319.

I thought it proper to add the following Passage taken out of the Journal-Book of the Royal Society, supposing it to be what Mr. Oldenburgh hints at in his Letter.

&quot;Nov. 16, 1671. [Sir Robert Moray] exhibited a certain Plant, (which was by Mr. Wray called Lichen terrestris cinereus) said by Sir Robert Moray to be very good to cure Dogs bitten by mad Dogs: His Royal Highness having caused it to be given to a whole Kennel of Dogs, bitten by a mad one, which were all cured, except one of them, to whom none of it was given.&quot;

The Specimen was kept in the Repository.

The same Virtue is likewise ascribed to this Plant, in the Third Part of Morison&#x27;s Plantar. Hist. Oxon. published at Oxford Anno 1699. in Folio, p. 632. where the Author, speaking of the Lichen terrestris cinereus, Raii Hist. &amp; Synopsis says, Adversus morbum canis rabidi egregium est Medicamentum.

Dampier, and the College of Physicians, in their Pulv. Antilyssus, prescribe equal Quantities of the Lichen and Pepper: But Dr. Mead, in a single Quarto Leaf published by him Anno 1735. hath alter&#x27;d the Proportions of the Composition, prescribing double the Quantity of Lichen to that of the Pepper. This difference in the Proportions must be left to the Judgment of Practitioners; but upon the Authority of another Minute in the Society&#x27;s Journal-Books, it may not be improper to make an Addition to the above-mention&#x27;d Dampier&#x27;s Powder.

&quot;March 7, 1671-2. Sir Robert Moray mention&#x27;d, that a whole Kennel of Dogs, belonging to his Royal Highness, were bitten by a mad Dog, and had been lately cured by a certain Herb called Stellaria, or Star of the Earth.&quot;

This Plant is the Lychnis viscosa, flore muscofo Casp. Bauhin. in English, Spanish Catch-fly. See these Transactions, No 187. where is a Receipt to cure mad Dogs, &amp;c. wherein this Plant is a principal Ingredient; which Receipt, communicated by Sir Robert Gourdon, was there published by his MAJESTY&#x27;s [special] Command, Anno 1687.

Wherefore, suppose the Composition were to be thus:

Take Ash-colour&#x27;d Ground-Liver-wort, black Pepper, and the Herb Spanish Catch-fly, all finely powder&#x27;d, of each two Drachms, for four Doses, to be taken as Dampier prescribes in his Letter in these Transactions, No 237.

ERRATUM.
