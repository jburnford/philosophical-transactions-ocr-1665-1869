B

Arbodes: some curious gleanings, after Ligon&#x27;s history of it, by Dr. Th. Town, viz. That every house, with Sugar-works and Outhouses, looks like a handsome Town; the whole Island like a scatter&#x27;d City, which with perpetual green Fields and green Woods make the prospect very pleasant; most houses now built with Stone, and cover&#x27;d with Slate; the Soyl very fertile, though no above one or two foot deep, upon a white and springy Limestone Rock, which in some places yields good Quarries for buildings; the Springs all near the Sea; in the higher Count ries they make Ponds to receive rain, which for so the better being kept cool by broad-leav&#x27;d weeds, and Duck-weed which overgrow the Ponds; and now almost every Sugar-plantation hath a Well which gives very good water, their only Wine in esteem is from the Matera&#x27;s, which (contrary to other Wines) will not endure a cool Cellar; the Air most pleasant, neither too cold by night, as formerly, nor too hot by day: On the tops of Mountains, and in cool and shady places, some of our European Plants are found: The Blood of Negro&#x27;s is black, which seems to be the cause of their black skin, &amp;c. n.117. p.399.
