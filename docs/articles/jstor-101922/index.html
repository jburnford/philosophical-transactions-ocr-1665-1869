<div class="ocr-text">of Hithe; and to have gone round that Point to the other side, the distance must have been much greater. So that the Promontory spoken of by Dion, must needs be the South-Foreland, and Cesar must Anchor near over against Dover, from whence Sailing 8 Miles, he would double a Head-land and come to the Downs; which is such a Coast as he describes in one place by apertum ac planum littus, and in his 5th Book by molle ac apertum littus. As to Dion’s word ἐξ τὰ πράγματα, what I have already said about it seems sufficient to prove that he means no more than the waters edge, and the Etymologists derive it from τῆς μαδεφαίκης, because the wash and breach of the Sea does always keep it wet. And this word παραπλάγιον is used by Polybius for the Sea Ouse; and in another place he speaks of the difficulty of Landing at the mouth of a River διὰ τὸ πράγμα παραπλάγιον, ob limosum accessum, so that it is not to be doubted that it ought to be rendred in this place, ad vadum maris rather than in paludibus. And so this objection against the assertion that Cesar Landed in the Downs, which is known to be a firm Champain Country without Fens and Morasses, will be removed; and the whole Argument will ’tis hoped be admitted by the Curious.

A Receit for the Curing of Caistorium, according to the method us’d in Russia.

Take the Beaver Stones and get the Milk out of them as clear as you can, then set upon the Fire a Skillet or Kettle with water, big enough to contain the quantity of Stones you have to cure: let the water Boil, and put into it half a shovel full of clean Wood Ashes, then tie the Stones together in couples and put them into the water, and let them Boil therein for half a quarter of an Hour. Then take some Birch-Bark and lay it on
the Fire, and let the Stones be well smoaked over it for the space of an hour, until they are well dried in the smoak; then hang them up in a Kitchen or in the Air for a week or more, until they are perfectly dry and hard, after which they may be pack&#x27;d up in a Cask or otherwise for Transportation. If there be more Stones than will conveniently go into the Skillet or Kettle, you may make another boiling of them, and add a proportion of fresh Ashes and order them as before.

Observations on the making of Cochineal, according to a Relation had from an Old Spaniard at Jamaica, who had lived many years in that part of the West-Indies where great quantities of that rich Commodity are yearly made.

THE Insect whereof it is made he confirms to be the same which we call the Lady-Bird, alias Cow-Lady, which he says at first appears like a small blister or little knob upon the Leaves of the Shrub on which they breed, which afterwards by the heat of the Sun, become a live Insect as above, or small Grub. This Shrub is allowed by several Authors to be the same which we call the Prickle-Pear, or Indian Fig, having thick roundish Leaves that grow one out of another and full of sharp prickles. These Grubs in process of time becoming Flies like our Lady-Birds, as above, and being come to full Maturity, (which must be found out by experience in collecting them at several seasons) they Kill by making a great smother of some combustible matter, to Windward of the shrubs whereon the Insects are feeding, (having before spread some Cloaths all under the Plants) whereby all the Insects being Smother&#x27;d and Kill&#x27;d, by shaking the Plants will tumble down upon the Cloths. Thus they are gathered in great quantities</div>
