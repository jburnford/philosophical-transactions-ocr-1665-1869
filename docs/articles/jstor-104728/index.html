An Account from James Burrow Esq; F.R.S. of what Mr. Boyfield told him concerning the late Earthquake.

Friday, March 16, 1749.

Read March 22, 1749.

Mr. Josiah Boyfield, of Gravel-Lane, near St. George&#x27;s Fields, Southwark, told me, that at the Time of the Earthquake, on Thursday Morning the 8th instant, he was not far from his Canal, and that it was a clear still Morning; the Air (as he expressed it) as clear as a Bell, with not a Breath of Wind stirring. As clear as a Bell, except that small Haziness which there almost always is in the Morning-Air.

He heard, he said, a great Noise like Thunder; which he at first took to be the Report of Ship-Guns; and immediately after the Ground shook and trembled under him, and he heard his Men say, Look at the Fish. The Sound came from the South-East, and moved to the West or North-West, over Westminster: It went off rattling like ten thousand Cannon; and he thought that Westminster-Abbey, and all that Part of the Town was coming down. The Sound preceded the Motion, and was ended before the Motion ceased.

He went, he says, nearer to the Canal, and saw the Water much disturbed; but he did not himself actually see the Fish leap out of the Water: However, some of his Men, whose Account he can depend upon, saw several Roach leap up, and saw the Fish in
in general shoot away in all Sorts of Directions, and seem to shift for themselves, as if they were frighted and alarmed at what had happened.

Observations on the Earthquake, March 8. 1749. by C. Mortimer, M.D. Secr. R. S.

Devonshire-street, near Queen&#x27;s-Square.

Read March 22. On Thursday Morning, March 3. 1750.

I awaked a little after Five; I open&#x27;d my Curtains, and observed the Sky hazy: I drank a Draught of Water, and looking on my Watch, found it to be but half an Hour past 5; and therefore was going to lie down again in my Bed; when, leaning upon my right Elbow, I first felt a Shock, as if the whole House was violently pushed from the NW to the SE and then, with equal Force, pushed back again from SE to NW between which Shocks I heard a dull Noise; as if something heavy, but soft, rolled to and fro&#x27; in the Garret over my Head. I saw the Cornice and Ceiling of the Room sensibly move, and then perceived a third and fourth Shock, so slow as to give me Time to reflect what might be the Event; and then a fifth and sixth, which I own began to frighten me; the Strokes seeming to be exceeding strong; not at all like a quaking or tremulous Motion, but like a forcible Shoving backwards and forwards; much resembling the Rocking of a Coach, when crossing the Rutts, or giving Way to another Carriage. My Son, who lay in the next Room called out in the midst of it to know</div>
