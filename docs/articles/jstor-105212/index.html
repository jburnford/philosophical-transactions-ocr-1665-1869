<div class="ocr-text">XCVIII. Some Observations upon the Agaric, lately applied after Amputations, with regard to the determining its Species. By Mr. William Watson, F. R. S.

Read Dec. 5, 1754.

THE agaric lately applied&#x27; as a styptic after amputations, and which has been brought from France, I do not believe to be the common agaric of the oak, as has been imagined by the French surgeons. What is called the common agaric is a parasitical plant, found growing upon the oak, and upon several other trees; and is denominated by Caspar Bauhin, *Fungus in caudicibus nascens, unguis equini figurâ*; of which touchwood or spunk, and the *amadoue ordinaire* of the French, is usually prepared. I think it impossible, by any process, to prepare from the common agaric a substance perfectly similar to the French agaric, which exactly answers the description, which Breynius gives of the *Fungus coriaceus quercinus hæmatodes*, and of which we find the following *account in the Ephemerides naturæ curiosorum.* &quot;In medio quercus,&quot; says that author, *medullæ velut subucula circumvolutus, inventus est: tener erat, mollis, flexilis, planus, nonnihil rugosus, eâ longitudine et latitudine, ut colobium ex eodem commodé conficere licuisset: colore pallido ad flavum nonnihil tendente; itemque substantiâ, tractatione, et figurâ

* An. 4, et 5. Obl. 150.
&quot;alutæ ex pelle caprinâ confectæ similior quam
ovum ovo, nisi quod crassior, materiâ minus com-
pactâ; intus præterea passim duriuscula &amp; rotunda
tubercula, in manus magis quam in oculos inter-
currentia occultante. Initio gustatus vis statim
quædam attractiva apparebat. Reperitur et in aliis
arboribus.&quot; Breynius further says, that this vege-
table has been recommended as a most excellent re-
medy to stop the bleeding at the nose.

Mr. Ray, in his Synopsis stirpium Britannicarum,
upon the authority of the late Dr. William Sherard,
says, that this Fungus coriaceus quercinus hæmatodes
is found upon putrid oaks in Ireland, where it is
called oak-leather; and that the country people there
collect and preserve it to dress ulcers with. Dr.
Sherard makes no doubt but that it may be found
in England; and Mr. Ray had even some sent him
from the late Dr. Eales in Hertfordshire. Dr.
Richardson, in Yorkshire, found it growing upon the
ash; and Dr. Dillenius further observes, that in Vir-
ginia it is used as leather, to spread plaisters upon;
and that, besides its being a soft substance, fitting
easy upon the afflicted part, it has a healing pro-
perty.

Thus much I thought proper to lay before the
Royal Society, in order that those members of it,
who correspond with the French surgeons, may
make some further inquiry into the nature, as well
as the preparation, if any, of this useful vegetable.

William Watson.
