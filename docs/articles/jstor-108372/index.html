<div class="ocr-text">IV. Spermatozoa observed within the Mammiferous Ovum.

By Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.SS. L. and E.

Received November 24,—Read December 8, 1842.

As the results of my researches in Embryology have all been communicated to the Royal Society*, it seems proper to offer to its notice a single observation which I have lately made.

On a former occasion† I stated that at certain periods an orifice was sometimes visible in the thick transparent membrane (&quot;zona pellucida&quot;) of the mammiferous ovum; and that once I had seen an object very much resembling a spermatozoon in the orifice. But spermatozoa, so far as I am aware, have never been described as seen within the ovum of any animal. It may therefore be interesting to physiologists to be informed that about a fortnight since, in examining some ova of the Rabbit of twenty-four hours, from the Fallopian tube,—in which the orifice above-mentioned was no longer visible,—I unexpectedly discerned a number of spermatozoa in their interior. These ova were submitted to the inspection of Professor Owen, and I afterwards showed one of them to Professors Sharpey and Grainger, all of whom agreed that the spermatozoa were contained within the ovum‡.

London, 21st November, 1842.

* Philosophical Transactions, 1838–39–40–41. † Ibid. 1840, p. 533.

‡ [The ova were in that state in which the essential part—the germ—consists of two cells. The spermatozoa lay around and between these cells; and when the ova were first examined I thought I discerned traces of spermatozoa even within the cells.

While the paper is going through the press, the opportunity is afforded me for mentioning that I have this day confirmed the observation above recorded; several ova from the Fallopian tube of another rabbit, in a somewhat earlier stage, having presented spermatozoa in their interior;—i.e. (as in the first observation) within the thick transparent membrane (&quot;zona pellucida&quot;) brought with the ovum from the ovary.—31st March, 1843.]</div>
