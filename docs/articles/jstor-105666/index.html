LXXXVIII. An Account of the Eclipse of the Moon, on the 8th of May 1762, in the Morning, observed by Mr. Short, in Surrey-Street, London.

Read May 13, 1762. Diameter of the Moon, (in the direction of an angle of 45° with the horizon, the lower end of the diameter being to the west of the center of the Moon) measured with an achromic object-glass micrometer of 40 feet focus, and found to be = 31&#x27; 31&#x27;&#x27;.7,

On 7th May, at - - - - - - 11 35 0
α Librae passed the meridian, at - - - 11 38 25
Preceding limb of the Moon on the meridian, at - - - - - - 11 49 58
Subsequent ditto, at - - - - - - 11 52 13½
Penumbra, sensible, at - - - - - - 13 40 0
Diameter of the Moon measured again, and found to be = 31&#x27; 26&#x27;&#x27;, at - - - 13 50 0
Beginning of the eclipse, through an achromic opera-glass, at - - - - - - 14 12 30
Shadow very dense upon the Moon&#x27;s limb, at - - - - - - - - 14 14 0
So that I conclude the eclipse began at 14 13 0

The times above are apparent times.
