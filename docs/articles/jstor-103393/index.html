<div class="ocr-text">The immediate cause of this he takes to be a pra-
ternatural thickness of the Blood occasion&#x27;d by a be-
ginning Coagulation of those parts of it, which con-
stitute the Crassamentum, whereby the Globules of
the Blood, and the particles of the Serum were im-
prison&#x27;d in a sort of Reticulum form&#x27;d by the Union
of the Fibres of the Blood.

The occasional Cause of this Sickness he deduces
from the cold and wetness of the Season, which
reign&#x27;d all the preceding Year from October 1710,
to November 1711. Which Observation is worthy
of remark, since the Season preceding the Mortality
among the Cattle here in England was remarkably
dry, and yet the Symptoms of the Distemper agreed
with those observ&#x27;d in Italy, as may appear from the Ac-
count given by the Learned Mr. Bates, Surgeon to his Ma-
jesty&#x27;s Household in Philosophical Transactions, No. 358

For the particular manner in which this learned
Gentleman endeavours to account Mechanically for the
thickness of the Blood in these Animals, from the
condition of the Season, and from that thickness of
the Blood to deduce all the particular Symptoms of
the Distemper, as likewise for his Conjectures con-
cerning those Medicines, which might have been ser-
viceable to the sick Cattle; he not having made tryal of
any, we must refer the Curious to the Treatise itself.
