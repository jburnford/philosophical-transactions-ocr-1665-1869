<div class="ocr-text">This way, as it is much simpler, so &#x27;tis by the Author esteem&#x27;d much more expedient than the former, by reason of the Sulphury-saline quality of Iron, which by Grinding being open&#x27;d and highly subtilized, acts the more powerfully upon the most solid body of Gold, and attracts withall the Salt that is in the Air in greater plenty, than can be done in a Glass or Golden Mortar. And if it be objected, that by that long continued Grinding the steely particles are worn off and commixt with those of the Gold; The Author would have it consider&#x27;d, how great a Cognition there is between those Sulphurs, and also, how great is the Use of Digestion, separating the pure from the impure, and withal exciting that occult fire of Mars, well known to the true Searchers of Nature; which, being assisted by the Alcohol of Wine, is able to concoct the little immature portion to a due maturity.

An Extract of a Letter of Mr. Lister to the Publisher, both enlarging and correcting his former Notes about Kermes; and withal insinuating his conjecture of Cochineil&#x27;s being a sort of Kermes.

Sir,

We must correct as well as enlarge our Notes concerning Kermes*; and yet there will be much difficulty in resolving the question concerning the Original and Efficient of Kermes. These things are certain:

1. That we have this year seen the very Gumm of the Apricot and Cherry-laurel-Trees transudated, at least, standing in a Crystal-drop upon some (though very rarely) of the tops of these Kermes.

2. That they change colour from a yellow to a dark-brown: that they seem to be distended and to wax greater, and from soft, to become brittle.

3. That they are fill&#x27;d with a sort of Mites; that small powder (which I said to be Excrement,) being Mites as well as that Liquamen or softer pulp (which I took to be Bees-meat;) concerning both which particulars I am pretty well assur&#x27;d by my own, and also by my ingenious friend, Dr. Johnson of Pomfret&#x27;s more accurat Microscopical Observations.

* Compare herewith, what was publish&#x27;t in No. 71. p. 2165, No. 72. p. 2177, especially No. 73. p. 2196.
4. That the Bee-grubbs actually feed on Mites, there being no other food for them.

5. That there are other species of Bees or Wasps besides those by me described; which are sometimes found to make these Mites their food: Dr. Johnson having open&#x27;d one Husk, with one only large Maggot in it.

6. That there are probably different sorts of Mites in these Husks, making possibly different species of Kermes: For, some I have found to hold Carnation colour&#x27;d Mites, enclosed in a fine white Cotton, the whole Husk starting from the Twigg, shrivelling up, and serving only for a Cap or Cover to that company of Mites. Other Mites I have seen white, and (which is most usual) the Husks continuing entire and not coming away from the Twigg they adhere to, and but little Cotton at the bottom. Those of the first sort are the white Cob-webbs on the Vine, described by Mr. Hook Micrograph. Obs. 56.

7. That the shrivell&#x27;d Cap to be found upon the Mites inclosed in Cotton, as also the whole Husk itself, if taken early in April, while soft, will, dried in the Sun, shrink into the very figure of Cochineil: Whence we guess, that Cochineil may be a sort of Kermes, taken thus early and sun-dried.

Hitherto this Summers Notes concerning Kermes. This advantage at least we may have by them; that the account, taken from M. Verney by Dr. Croon, and publish&#x27;t in one of the Transactions,* is made more intelligible: the small scarlet powder, there mention&#x27;d, being to be understood of those Mites; and they to be distinguish&#x27;t from the Bee-grubbs, which are chang&#x27;d into the Skipping Fly, that is, the Bee, (for kind at least) by us described formerly, I am, &amp;c. York Octob. 9. 1671.

An Extract of a Letter Written to the Publisher by Mr. Thomas Platt, from Florence, August 6. 1672. concerning some Experiments, there made upon Vipers, since Mons. Charas his Reply to the Letter written by Signor Francesco Redi to Monsieur Bourdelot and Monsieur Morus.

Sir,

I shall begin with telling you, that in a Conversation last Winter, where I had the good fortune to make one of the number, the discourse was of an Opinion of M. Dela Chambre, who,</div>
