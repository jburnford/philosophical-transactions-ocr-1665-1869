*Philosopb. Transact. Numb. 262 Tab. 2.*
II. Part of a Letter from the Reverend Mr Derham to Dr Sloane, giving an account of his observations of the weather for the Year 99.

Upminster, Jan. 23. 1699.

SIR,

I here send you the Tables of my last years observations; together with which I think it convenient to send some few remarks relating thereunto.

I promis&#x27;d last year the addition of two Columns to each Months observations, which are here inserted. The one sheweth the Flying of the Clouds, concerning which I desire it may be observed, that I have never set down the Point towards which the Clouds flew; but when they varied from the Winds. In all those vacancies therefore in the Column of Clouds, it is to be supposed, that either there were no Clouds at all appeared, or their motion was not discernible, or that they flew in the same track with the Winds.

Concerning the Thermometer, it is necessary that I should tell you, that the graduation of it is by Inch-measure, viz. Inches and tenths of Inches. The point of Freezing is at about 8°, or at most 8°2 degrees, and consequently &#x27;tis Cold at about 9°, and Temperate at about 10° degrees. I need not say, that the Degrees above 100 are Warm or Hot; and those below 80 are Harder Frosts. The Degrees of my Thermometer reach to 24°, altho I could never make the Spirits descend with Artificial Freezing, much lower than 50, neither when expos&#x27;d to the heat of a pretty strong Sun, did they ascend above 225.
The Situation of my Thermometer is against a Northern Wall in the open Air: whereby it is defended against the Heat of the Sun, and so sheweth only the true present Temperature of the Air. &#x27;Tis also guarded against the Beams of the Morning and Evening Sun, when it riseth and setteth on the Northern side of the E. and W. points of the Horizon.

I have thought it unnecessary for the most part, in the Column of Weather, to take notice of the Temperature of the Air, whether Hot, Cold, or Moderate, because the Column of the Thermometer sheweth this. Neither also have I said what Rain fell, whether much or little, because the Column of Rain sufficiently demonstrateth it. So that it is easy to observe, almost at one view, what Seasons we have had last year, whether Hot, Cold, Temperate, Wet or Dry. I need look no farther back for an instance, than the last Winter-Months, which now, or any time hereafter, we may discover to have been very mild, by the Spirits having been for the most part above 82 Degrees. Yea, many of the days of November and December, we may find were not much colder than many of the mornings and evenings of the warmer Months. So also for Wet and Dry, we may find what reason there is for the present great scarcity of Water, which is complained of in many places. For besides what happened in former Months, the two last Months of the Year were much dryer than usual, so that had it not been for the rains of October, perhaps a drought had been a General calamity.

I have had frequent confirmations of what I observ&#x27;d last year, (Phil. Trans. N. 249.) concerning the Mercury rising in Foggy weather. The like it doth also in misting weather; as may be seen in divers places of the Table.
I observed last year, that the highest pitch I ever found the Mercury at, was 30.40 inches. But Dec. 22. last, the Weather being misting, and Wind Northerly, it ascended to 30.50 inches, the highest I ever saw it at Upminster.

Whether the observations my Register is filled with, will be of any use, to judge of the Fertility or Scarcity, the Healthiness or Diseases, or any other occurrences of the last, or of former or future years, I shall leave to the much better judgments of the learned Members of your Honourable Society, who have been pleased to accept of my past labours of this kind, and by their desires to command my continuance of the same for the future. Whether what I have done may answer your expectations, I am not able to judge. I can only assure you, that it is done with all possible accuracy and fidelity.

I beg pardon for the chasms which you will meet with in some of the months, occasioned by my absence from my observations about necessary affairs. I am

SIR,

Your most Humble Servant,

W. Derham.</div>
