EXPLANATION OF THE TABLE.

The first column of figures denotes the order of the months according to their degrees of heat, beginning with August, in which the heat is greatest.

The second, and third, are the heats marked at the hour expressed at the top of each column, and the fourth is the mean between these two.

The last column is the mean of the greatest cold at night, observed in Marlborough-street for twenty years, by the late Right Honourable Lord Charles Cavendish.</div>
