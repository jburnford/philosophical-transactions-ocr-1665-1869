<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">IV. Part of a Letter from Mr Samuel Brady, to Dr William Cockburn, F.R.S. giving an Account of a Puppy in the Womb that receiv&#x27;d no Nourishment by the Mouth.

In the Conversation we had about the Nourishment of the Fetus in the Womb, wherein we seemed to agree it was perform&#x27;d by the Umbilical Vessels only, without the assistance of the Mouth, I mention&#x27;d a Puppy at its full growth, which had never receiv&#x27;d any Nourishment this latter way. It was whelp&#x27;d November 1704. had no appearance of a Mouth at all, liv&#x27;d some time after it was parted from its Dam; pulling the Skin off its Head, it had not the least passage through it: The Head was one solid Bone, without Sutures, somewhat Round, as a Mans Skull, with a little prominence in the fore-part, resembling the Os Nas of a Man, but without any passage: It had no place for Eyes, nor Meatus for Ears, only the Outward Resemblance of one on each side, unpenetrated and plac&#x27;d lower than naturally. No Jaw-bone, nor Conveyance to the top of the Larynx and Pharynx, but thence downward natural. I send you its Skin, stuff&#x27;d carelessly for my own private satisfaction; for which you may see it was only design&#x27;d, by the little care taken in its preservation from the Mice, and the loss of the Bones: However, enough of it remains to mew that it receiv&#x27;d no Nourishment by the Mouth.</div>
