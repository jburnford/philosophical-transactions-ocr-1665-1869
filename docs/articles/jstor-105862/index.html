At 10h 29&#x27; 4&#x27;&#x27; the satellite begins to appear at \( \mu \)&#x27;s eastern limb; at 10h 51&#x27; 34&#x27;&#x27; half out; at 10h 51&#x27; 34&#x27;&#x27; quite separated from \( \mu \)&#x27;s limb. |

| April 29   | 10 13 29  | E. 3. Clear sky. 4 well defined. The satellite already emerged, perhaps for ¼ of a minute; it recovered not its full light till 4&#x27; after. The emergence was a diameter from 4. |
| May 5      | 12 9 39   | E. 2. Clear sky. 4 well defined. Satellite emerged at more than a diameter from 4, being then 25° high westward. Good observation. |

9 51 40 E. I. At Calais; sky serene; 24 well defined. The satellite emerged at the distance of \( \frac{1}{2} \) a diameter. Same refractor. Good observation.

8 11 24 4 I. 4. At Dunkirk; serene sky; but 24 near the horizon; the belts, however, appeared plain, and I think it a good observation. The satellite was more than 6&#x27; losing its light. Dollond&#x27;s 3\(\frac{1}{2}\) feet refractor.

II 47 54 E. I. At Dunkirk; serene sky; but 24 very near the horizon, and ill defined. Doubtful observation.

Observations on the shadow of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites, and the variations of his belts, at the Observatory of the Marine, with a Gregorian reflector, of 30 inches focus, magnifying 104 times.

Febr. 19
12 58 46 The shadow of the first satellite appeared entirely on 24&#x27;s disc, and proceeded along the upper part of the middle belt.

13 18 3 The satellite itself entered half way on 24&#x27;s disc, following its shadow on the same belt.

14 1 7 The shadow of the fourth entirely entered on 24&#x27;s disk, and running along the lower edge of 24&#x27;s upper belt.

15 3 57 The shadow of the first satellite in internal contact with 24&#x27;s limb.

15 7 27 The shadow of the first quite off 24&#x27;s limb.

15 25 23 The first beginning to go off the disc.

15 29 53 The first gone off, but still in external contact with the limb.

15 29 53 The shadow of the fourth seems advanced one half of its path over the disc.

16 29 43 The shadow of the fourth seems to be two of its own diameters from 24&#x27;s limb.

Vol. LIX.
The shadow of the fourth seemed larger than that of the first; it was also more perceptible; owing, perhaps, to the shadow of the first running along the upper side of the middle belt, which was darker and more conspicuous than the upper belt, where the shadow of the fourth was. It was an easy matter to form a judgment of their differences, as the two shadows were at the same time seen on Uranus&#x27;s disc. At $6\frac{1}{4}$h in the morning the sky became clouded, so that the egress of the fourth from the disc could not be observed.

The figure no 1 (Tab. XIX) represents Uranus&#x27;s disc at the moment of the entry of the shadow of the first satellite; the upper part was shaded, but less sensibly than the middle belt, which was blackish, and of a darker hue in some parts than in others. Below this middle belt, another was visible, which terminated at about two-thirds of Uranus&#x27;s diameter. It was narrow, but as distinguishable as the middle belt.

The fig. no 2 represents the shadow of the fourth satellite, which passed along the upper belt less distinct than the middle one. At $3^h 11&#x27;&#x27;$ the lower narrow belt was not to be seen; the middle belt was also altered, being of various shades, and different from that represented in fig. 1. at the time of the immersion of the shadow of the first satellite.

The fig. no 3 represents the shadows of the first and fourth satellites, viewed at the same time.

The fig. no 4 represents Uranus&#x27;s belts: the upper belt was the same as in fig. no 1: the middle belt was likewise the same:
the narrow belt, which had disappeared, appeared again on the eastern side. At $4^h\ 30&#x27;$ it was advanced $\frac{1}{4}$ of the diameter. At $5^h\ 58&#x27;$ it extended almost from one limb to the other, as narrow and sensible as in fig. n° 1.

The 6th of September, 1760, having computed the ingress of the third satellite on $U$&#x27;s disc, I viewed the Planet with a Gregorian reflector of 30 inches focus, magnifying 104 times. At $7^h\ 4&#x27;&#x27;$ I perceived at the center of the Planet, on the lower belt, a black spot, pretty round, and nearly of the size of the shadow of the first satellite. I guessed this spot to be the shadow of the third. I observed its progress, and being got on $\frac{2}{7}$ of $U$&#x27;s disc, at $8^h\ 13&#x27;$ I perceived the shadow of the third just entered on $U$&#x27;s eastern limb, and was larger than that I observed before, which made me to imagine, that the first shadow might be a spot on the very disc of the third satellite. I went on with my observations, and found, that the nearer this shadow approached the western limb of $U$, the more it was diminished in size, and I lost sight of it before it had got to the Planet&#x27;s limb. Lastly, at $9^h\ 26&#x27;$, the third satellite was half emerged, and formed an indentation on the disc. I was then well satisfied, that the observed spot was on the disc of the third satellite; and I took notice, that this satellite, when quite emerged, was not so luminous as usual.

The 28th of March, 1766, having viewed Saturn with the same achromatic reflector of 10 feet 7 inches focus, I perceived on his globe two darkish belts; they were indeed extremely faint, and difficult to be discerned, directed, however, in a right line parallel to the longest diameter of Saturn&#x27;s ring.

The several observations here recited are extremely nice; and it were to be wished that astronomers, concerned in observations, might be accommodated with achromatic telescopes, of the most perfect construction; as such are the only instruments whereby a great knowledge of the celestial bodies can be acquired, for the improvement and perfection of astronomy.

| 17 51 22 | Moon&#x27;s diameter. |
| 17 55 20 | Much penumbra still left. |
| 17 57 30 | Now as before the eclipse began. |
| 18 14 20 | Now little or nothing sensible. |

During the night of the eclipse the sky was greyish, and overspread with thin clouds; but the stars might be discerned. The shadow pretty well defined, and would have been much more if the sky had been clear. The cold was considerable all night long, the thermometer marking 11 degrees below 0, on Reaumur&#x27;s scale.

Observation of the total Eclipse of the Moon, the 23d of December, 1768, in the Evening, at the same Observatory of the Marine, with the same Newtonian Reflector of 4½ feet. The Sky serene during the 23d Day, but some Clouds in the West during the Eclipse; in the East serene, with a small Mist, which was favourable; the Shadow well defined. I had no View of the Moon, at the Horizon, because of elevated Land Objects.
