Read November 21, 1771.

1769 April 13

We came to an anchor in Royal Bay in King George&#x27;s island.

Fixed upon the North point of the bay, which is the most Northern point of the island, for the place of observation; here we built a small fort, to secure us against the natives, which we called fort Venus: it was not finished and the instruments set up in proper order until the 10th of May, therefore the time for all observations made before this day, was taken by a watch with a second hand, the going of which was ascertained by altitudes of the sun as often as were necessary.

The astronomical clock, made by Shelton and furnished with a gridiron pendulum, was set up in the middle of one end of a large tent, in a frame of wood made for the purpose at Greenwich, fixed firm and as low in the ground as the door of the clock-case would admit, and to prevent its being disturbed by any accident, another framing of wood was made round this, at the distance of one foot from it. The pendulum was adjusted
justed exactly to the same length as it had been at Greenwich. Without the end of the tent facing the clock, and 12 feet from it, stood the observatory, in which were set up the journeyman clock and astronomical quadrant: this last, made by Mr. Bird, of one foot radius, stood upon the head of a large cask fixed firm in the ground, and well filled with wet heavy sand. A centinel was placed continually over the tent and observatory, with orders to suffer no one to enter either the one or the other, but those whose business it was. The telescopes made use of in the observations were—Two reflecting ones of two feet focus each, made by the late Mr. James Short, one of which was furnished with an object glass micrometer. Thus furnished, the following observations were made.

Hence the daily rate of the clock&#x27;s losing on mean time, by a mean of these 40 results, is 20.8 seconds. By the first and last days observations compared together, the clock lost 19&#x27; 49.7&quot; on mean time in 57 days, which is at the rate of 20,&quot;/88 or 20,&quot;/9 per day. The swing of the pendulum
pendulum on each side of the perpendicular during this time, varied between $1^\circ 50&#x27;$ and $1^\circ 55&#x27;$.

**Remark.** The same clock, when fixed up at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, before the voyage, with the pendulum of the same length, got at the rate of $1&#x27; 45.8&#x27;&#x27;$ per day, on mean time, between April 19 and July 18, 1768. Therefore the force of gravity at Greenwich is to that at King George&#x27;s Island, as 1000000 to 997075. N. M.

The mean of the seven mean results from the sun and six stars, to the North, gives the latitude $17^\circ 28&#x27; 51&#x27;&#x27;$ S. The mean of the nine results from the nine stars to the South, gives the latitude $17^\circ 29&#x27; 38&#x27;&#x27;$ S. The mean of these two means is $17^\circ 29&#x27; 15&#x27;&#x27;$ S. which may be taken for the latitude of the observatory.

N. B. Before any observations were made with the quadrant, the line of collimation was adjusted, by means of a distant object, by inverting the quadrant.

It must be confessed, that the results of these observations (most of which were made by Mr. Green) differ more from one another than they ought to do, or than those done made by other observers, with quadrants of the same size, and made by the same artifit, the cause of which, if not owing to want of care and address in the observer, I don&#x27;t know how to assign.

**Note.** Every line of the Lunar Observations is the mean of three, which we call a set. We take three or five such sets at a time, and calculate the mean of each separately. The ground where all the Altitudes were taken, is 13 feet 6 inches above the horizontal level; the zenith distances are all taken with the Astronomical Quadrant. These distances of the Moon from the Sun and fixt flares, were observed with a brass Hadley&#x27;s sextant, fitted with edge-bars, made by Mr. Ramsden.

Mean of these Observations gives George’s Island to be in Long. 149° 36&#x27; 38&quot; W. of Greenwich Observatory, at ♦’s fort.

Observations
Observations of the Eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s Satellites, with reflecting Telescopes of 2 Feet Focus, and the Longitude of the Observatory thence deduced.

Mean of the seven observations of the first Satellite, rejecting those of the 10th and 12th of May, as too near Jupiter&#x27;s opposition to the Sun, gives the longitude of Venus&#x27;s Fort 9° 57&#x27; 50&quot; = 149° 27&#x27; 30&quot;. Add 20&quot; for the correction of the times in the nautical almanack, as found by the observations of March 29 and April 12, at Greenwich, the true longitude will be 9° 58&#x27; 10&quot; = 149° 32&#x27; 30&quot;.

The first appearance of Venus on the Sun, was certainly only the penumbra, and the contact of the limbs did not happen till several seconds after, and then it appeared as in fig. the 4th; this appearance was observed both by Mr. Green and me; but the time it happened was not noted by either of us; it appeared
peared to be very difficult to judge precisely of the times that
the internal contacts of the body of Venus happened, by reason
of the darkness of the penumbra at the Sun&#x27;s limb, it being
there nearly, if not quite, as dark as the planet. At this time a
faint light, much weaker than the rest of the penumbra, appeared
to converge towards the point of contact, but did not quite
reach it, see fig. 2. This was seen by myself and the two other
observers, and was of great assistance to us in judging of the
time of the internal contacts of the dark body of Venus, with
the Sun&#x27;s limb. Fig. the 5th, is a representation of the appearance
of Venus at the middle of the ingress and egress, for the very same
phenomenon was observed at both: at the total ingress, the
thread of light made its appearance with an uncertainty of seve-
ral seconds; I judged that the penumbra was in contact with
the Sun&#x27;s limb 10&quot; sooner than the time set down above; in
like manner at the egress the thread of light was not broke off
or diminished at once, but gradually, with the same uncertainty:
the time noted was when the thread of light was wholly broke
by the penumbra. At the total egress I found it difficult to
distinguish Venus&#x27;s limb from the penumbra; which of course
made the second external contact a little doubtful, and the pre-
cise time that the penumbra left the Sun could not be observed
to any great degree of certainty, at least by me. Some of the
other gentlemen, who were sent to observe at different places,
saw at the ingress and egress the same phenomenon as we did;
though much less distinct, which no doubt was owing to their
telescopes being of a less magnifying power; for the penumbra
was visible through my telescope during the whole Transit; and
Dr. Solander, whose telescope magnified more than ours, saw it,
I have reason to think, distincter than either Mr. Green or my-
self; though we both of us saw enough to convince our senses,
that such a phenomenon did indisputably exist, and we had
a good opportunity to observe it, for every wished-for favourable
circumstance attended the whole of that day, without one
single impediment, excepting the heat, which was intolerable:
the thermometer which hung by the clock and was exposed to the
sun as we were, was one time as high as 119°. The breadth
of the penumbra appeared to me, to be nearly equal to 1/8th of
Venus&#x27;s semidiameter.

Half the difference of these two means is +9,82 ver. = +8,4&#x27;&#x27; the correction of the adjustment of the micrometer to be added to all observations made on the scale; and half the sum of the two means is 10 pts. 14,31 ver. = 54,97&#x27;&#x27; Venus&#x27;s apparent diameter.

After the above measurements of Venus&#x27; diameter, I fixed my telescope on an equatorial stand, which was screwed down to a large cask filled with sand and water; and by repeated trials a day before, an object (as the sun) would move on along the wire a quarter of an hour without any sensible difference. Thus equipped, I took the following observations, a careful person noting the time by the clock and another writing down. By repeated
peated trials some days before, I found the telescope at distinct vision, when it stood at
on the scale; therefore I put it to this before I measured Venus&#x27;s diameter.

I read them all off myself and saw each written down.

At the last observation I looked at the thermometer which was close by me, and it was 113 degrees high.

With my telescope as before, I measured the following horizontal diameters of the Sun and Venus.

The Sun’s horizontal diameter:

Half
Half the difference of these two means, is \(+9.92\) vern. \(= +8.5&#x27;&#x27;\) the correction of the adjustment of the micrometer, which only differs \(\frac{1}{6}\)th of a second from what was found by the measures of Venus&#x27;s diameter before. Half the sum of the two means is \(10^{\circ} 14.08 = 54.77&#x27;&#x27;\) Venus&#x27;s apparent diameter, which was found before \(54.97&#x27;&#x27;\). The mean of the two results is \(54.87&#x27;&#x27;\) or \(54.9&#x27;&#x27;\).

After the last measurements of the Sun and Venus&#x27;s diameters, I replaced my telescope on the equatorial stand, and took the following observations.

N. B. The observations made by Mr. Green with Dollond&#x27;s micrometer, particularly those concerning the difference of declination of Venus and the Sun&#x27;s limbs, and the distances of Venus from the Sun&#x27;s limb in lines parallel to the equator, will be better understood by consulting a paper intitled Directions for observing the Differences of Declination &amp;c. with Dollond&#x27;s Micrometer, by N. Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal, a copy of which was given to Mr. Green, before his departure from England; which will appear in this volume.

N. B. Each of the above Observations is the mean of ten, twelve, or more; with the face of the instrument turned alternately East and West: those made at sea are a little dubious on account of the motion of the ship; but, by means of a swinging table we had made to set the compass upon, we could, in a tolerable smooth sea, be certain of the dip to a degree, or at the most two, by taking the mean of a great number of trials.

Hence the mean height of the tides is about 10 inches, and the greatest height scarcely exceeds one foot, in the middle of this wide-extended ocean; which falls far short of what might have been expected from physical principles. The cause of this remarkable difference deserves farther inquiry. The time of high water also appears to precede the moon’s passing the meridian by 45 minutes at a medium, and the time of low water to precede the same, by 6h 31&#x27;. But the mean difference of high and low water, should be 6h 12&#x27;, which subtracted from 6h 31&#x27;, leaves 0h 19&#x27;, by which the time of high water should precede the moon’s passing the meridian; the mean of this and 0h 45&#x27; is 32&#x27;, by which the time of high water precedes the moon’s passing the meridian, by a medium of all the observations. The times of high and low water seem to be subject to great irregularity on particular days; no doubt owing to the small rise of the water, and the smallness of its force in consequence, which renders it more liable to be disturbed by the action of the winds and other causes: part of the irregularity may be attributed to the difficulty of observing the time of the flood or ebb, with any degree of certainty. N. M.

N. B. The island here named King George’s Island, is called by the natives Ota-heite, by which name it will henceforth be called, the name of K. George’s Island having been given before to another island in lat. 14 S. discovered by Commodore Byron.

* Mr. Green having died at sea in the passage home from Batavia, all the astronomical and other observations were partly arranged by Capt. Cook, and partly by the Astronomer Royal, from the original manuscripts, and calculated by the latter.</div>
