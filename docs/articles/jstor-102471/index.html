<div class="ocr-text">V. A Second Letter concerning the same.

Cookridge, Novemb. 2d. 1694.

Honoured Sir,

Yesterday I saw the Weather again, his Udder is much fallen, each side being now about the bigness of a Wallnut; there is Milk still in it, enough to stream out above half a yard. There is no Tokens at all of an Hermaphrodite in him. I compared him with another Weather, who had Teats or Paps like him, and differed in nothing but the Udder. It seems the Ewe dyed upon shearing, being over-heated, and lying on the Ground without her Fleece, took Cold, and dyed presently. The Lamb, they say, was about five Weeks old, so &#x27;tis likely might feed partly upon Grass, as I suppose other Lambs of the like Age do, notwithstanding what they suck from their Dams, &amp;c.

The Design of this Book, as the Author says himself in his Preface, is to state the Boundaries of Ancient and Modern Learning, that so Men may know</div>
