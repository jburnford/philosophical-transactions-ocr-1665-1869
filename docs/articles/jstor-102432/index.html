<div class="ocr-text">IV. An Account of the Burning of several Hay-Ricks by a Fiery Exhalation or Damp: And of the Infectious Quality of the Grass of several Grounds. From the same Ingenious Person.

SIR,

I received this last Post from my worthily esteemed Friend Mr. Maurice Jones, Rector of Dol-Gelheu; the following Account of the burning of several Ricks of Hay and Houses, and also the Poisoning of the Grass, so as to render it Mortal to the Cattle that feed upon it, by a kindled Exhalation, or Ignis Fatuus. Be pleased to take it in his own words:

&#x27;This Letter contains no Answer to your Queries about the Locusts, for I am wholly intent at present upon giving you the best Account I can of a most Dismal and Prodigious Accident at Harlech in this County the beginning of these Holy-days. It is of the unaccountable firing of Sixteen Ricks of Hay, and two Barns, whereof one was full of Corn, the other of Hay. I call it unaccountable, because &#x27;tis evident they were not burnt by common Fire, but by a kindled Exhalation, which was often seen to come from the Sea. Of the duration whereof I cannot at present give you any certain Account, but am satisfied it lasted at least a Fortnight or three Weeks; and annoy&#x27;d the Country as well by Poisoning their Grass as Firing the Hay, for the space of a Mile, or thereabouts. Such as have seen the Fire, say, &#x27;twas a blew weak Flames easily
easily extinguish&#x27;d, and that it did not the least harm
to any of the Men who interposed their Endeavours
to save the Hay, though they ventured (perceiving it
different from common Fire) not only close to it, but
sometimes into it. All the Damage sustained happen&#x27;d
constantly in the Night. I have enclosed a Catalogue
of such as I have received certain Information of;
and have nothing to add, but that there are three small
Tenements in the same Neighbour-hood (called Tydbin
Siôn Wyn) whereof the Grais is so infected, that it ab-
solutely kills all manner of Cattle that feed upon it.
The Grais has been Infectious these three Years, but
not thoroughly Fatal till this last. Pray send me with
all convenient speed your Friends Thoughts and your
own, of the Causes, and if possible, also the Remedy
of this surprizing Phenomenon, &amp;c.

Dòl-Gelheu,
Jan. 20th. 1693.

Decemb. 24th. 1693. Richard Griffith of Lechwedd-du,
Humphrey Owen of Garreg-wenn, and Richard Davyd of
Erw-wenn, each of them lost a Rick of Hay the 24th.
at Night.

Decemb. 27th. 1693. That Night was burnt one Rick
of Hay of John Philips of Inys Lanvihangel y Traethau,
two Ricks of Hay of Griffith John Owen of Cefn Trevor-
bach, and Katherine William, Widdow, of Cefn-Trevor-
fawr, lost two Ricks.

Decemb. 29th. 1693. That Night Francis Evans of
Glas-vryn had one Rick burnt. Richard Davyd of Erw-
wen, predict. had a Barn full of Hay of three Bayles of
Buildings burnt down to the Ground.
