<div class="ocr-text">XII. An Account of an Experiment touching the Proportions of the Ascent of Spirit of Wine between two Glass Planes, whose Surfaces were plac&#x27;d at certain different Distances from each other. By the late Mr. Francis Hauksbee, F. R. S.

I Took two Glass Planes, about 6 Inches long, and two broad: These (being made clean) I separated at each end by the number of 32 pieces of Brass Lamine, whose thickness, when laid one upon another, and press&#x27;d together by Screws, made a distance between the Planes equal to (as near as I could measure) $\frac{1}{8}$ of an Inch. Being thus prepar&#x27;d, I plung&#x27;d one end of them into some ting&#x27;d Spirit of Wine; and after I had wetted the inward Surfaces of the Planes with it, by declining the upper end, I set them upright; and found that the Surface of the Wine between them remain&#x27;d higher than the Surface of the Wine on their outsides, by a distance equal to the first Line C D above the Line A B, the Line A B being the common Surface, in all the tryals, on the outside of the Planes. (See the Scheme hereunto annexed) After this, I reduc&#x27;d the distances of the Planes to half the former, by taking away 16 of the Brass Lamine from each end of them; then being plung&#x27;d into the Liquid, and used in all respects as before, I found the Wine to stand between the Planes just double the height it stood at in the former tryal; as may be observ&#x27;d by the Line E F in the Scheme. Again removing half the number of Brass pieces, whereby but 8 of them were left at each end, and using them as
as in the preceding manner, the Wine rose between them to a height just double to that in the foregoing tryal, mark&#x27;d in the Scheme by the Line G H. Thus from 8 I reduc&#x27;d them to 4 pieces at each end of the Planes; then again the Wine was seen to remain suspended to twice the last observ&#x27;d height, represented by the Line I K. In this last tryal the Planes were distant one from the other but $\frac{1}{128}$ of an Inch; nearer than that I could make no certain measure; but I suppose the fore-cited Experiments are sufficient to ground a Calculation upon, even of the most near Approximations.
