Extracts of Letters from Maurice Johnson, Esq; President of the Gentlemens Society at Spalding, and from John Green, Esq; Secretary of the same, to Emanuel Mendez da Costa, Esq; F.R.S. concerning an Earthquake felt on Aug. 23. 1750.

Extract of a Letter from Maurice Johnson, Esq; to Emanuel Mendez da Costa, F.R.S. dated at Spalding in Lincolnshire, 25th August 1750.

Read Nov. 1. On Thursday the 23d Instant, the Air 1750. mild and calm, no Wind stirring, the Sun shining bright, at about 45 Minutes past 6 o’Clock in the Morning, a Shock of an Earthquake was sensibly felt here, and hereabout, attended with a loud Noise, and Crack (as some call it): This was perceived both Southward, and Northwardly, for some Seconds. A Gentleman from Newark in Nottinghamshire, N.E. of us about 30 Miles, says it was also felt there.

Extract, concerning the same Earthquake, from a Letter of Dr. John Green, of the said Place.

He informs me, that he was then at Uppingham in Rutlandshire, sitting in a Room intent on writing and thinking, when he was surprised with a Sound very strong and awful; which, at the first Moment, made him think of the rattling of a Coach upon the Pavement: But this Apprehension was immediately corrected by somewhat very different in the Sound, and raised in him an Idea of the crashing of a falling House. He felt himself in a very shaking way: The Table at which he sat shivered, and the Windows of the Room jarred: But he did not think of an Earthquake, till the People of the House came into the Room, and told him what had happened.
