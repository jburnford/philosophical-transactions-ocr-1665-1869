Secondly, That those of Muscovy are made under Ground, by digging a deep Pit, of almost the Figure of a Sugar-loaf, broad below, and narrow at the top; the sides well-plaister&#x27;d round about, and the top very close cover&#x27;d with Stone. The people of that Countrey are so very careful, to have the Corn well dried, before they put it into those Subterraneous Granaries, that, when the weather of that Northern Climat serves not to dry it sufficiently, they heat their Barns, by the means of great Ovens, and thereby very well drying their Corn, supply the deficiency of their short Summer.

Inquiries For Hungary and Transylvania.

In prosecution of the Engagement, published Numb. 23. p. 414, 422. we now subjoyn some other Inquiries, and first these, that were very lately recommended to a studious and inquisitive Transylvanian, who from London returned to his Countrey, and promised to procure good Answers to the following particulars, Viz.

4. To give us a true account of the right Gold-and Silver-Earth-ore, said to be found at Cranach in Hungary; whence the Gold is called Cranach-Gold, first lighted upon by the care of the Emperour Rudolphus, and chymically wrought by his order and inspection?

5. To inquire after, and send over some of that kind of Vitriol, which by credible persons is affirmed to be found crystallized in Transylvania: As also, after the Vitriol of Tyrol, said to yield Gold.

6. To inform us of the Salt-pits in Transylvania, said to yield two sorts of perfect Salt, the one being a Sal Gemmae, the other, a common Table-Salt. To observe how deep these Salt-mines lie from the surface of the Ground? How deep they are digg&#x27;d hitherto; and what Damps are met within them, &amp;c?

7. To inquire after the Veins of Gold and Quick-silver at Cremnitz in Hungary; and the Vein of Silver at Schemnitz in the same Kingdom: And to send over some of the best Ores of them?

8. To inquire, Whether the Waters of the Therme, that pass by Schemnitz, depose a certain sediment, which in time turns into a yellow Stone?

9. Whether in the Mines of Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Lead, in Hungary, there be generally found Quick-silver and Sulphur?

10. Whether it be true, that in the Copper-Mines of the place called Herren-ground in Hungary, there be found no Quick-silver at all?

11.

15. Whether there be in Hungary an Avernus, that exhaleth almost always such poisonous Steams, that Birds flying over it, do often-times fall down, either stupified, or quite dead?

16. Whether the Iron, that is said to be turned into Copper, by the Vitriolate Springs at Cremnitz or Smolnitz in Hungary, do after that Transmutation or Precipitation, contain a pretty deal of Gold?

21. What is the way, said to be used in Austria and Hungary, of extracting the perfect Metals out of their Minera&#x27;s without Lead; performed by casting a Powder upon the Minera, which makes a quick and advantageous separation; Sulphur being supposed to be an Ingredient of it?
Inquiries For Ægypt, by Thomas Henshaw Esq;

1. Whether it rain there at any time, and if so, what time of the Year? Whether Rain make the Air wholesome, or pestilential, or otherwise unhealthful?

2. To consider the Niter that is commonly sold there, and what affinity there is betwixt that, and our common Saltpeeter: to try by dissolving it in warm water, filtering it well, then boiling almost half away, and putting the remainder in an earthen Pan, and setting it in a cool place for two days, to see whether it will shoot into Crystals of Peeter. To send some quantity of it into Europe.
