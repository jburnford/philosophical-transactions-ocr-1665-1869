XX. Giving an Account of divers Rare Plants, observed this Summer, A.D. 1713, in several Curious Gardens about London, and particularly the Society of Apothecaries Physick Garden at Chelsea. By James Petiver, F.R.S.

Sect. I. Ferns, or Capillary Plants, Ray H. Pl. 131.

Cornutus his Canada Maidenhair, Ray 148. 2.

Dianthus Americanum Cornuti Pag. 7. Fig. Adiantum fruticosum Americanum Park. 1050. fig. fruticosum Brasilianum C.B. 355. 4. Prodr. 150. descr.

This is a beautiful Fern, differing from our true Maidenhair of the Shops, in having its Branches more spacious and curl&#x27;d. Cornutus first discovered it in Canada, since which it has been found in Virginia and Maryland. I have observ&#x27;d it at the Bishop of London&#x27;s at Fulham, Place, and in our Physick Garden at Chelsea.

Common Ceterach, Ray 139.

Asplenium C.B. in Matth. 646. fig. opt. Asplenium sive Ceterach Park. 1046. fig. Ger. 978. fig. 1: Jonst. 1140. fig. 1. Chabr. 556. Ic. 6. I. B. 3. lib. 37. p. 749. Fig. Ceterach Officinarum CB. pin. 354.

Grows on old Churches, Castles, and Stone Walls in diverse Parts of England, especially about Bristol, where I have observed it plentifully.

Osmund Royal, or Flowring Fern, Ray 151. cap. 5.

Filix florida sive Osmunda Regalis Jonst. 103. fig. Filix ramosa, floribus insignis Chabr. 554. Ic. 4. I. B. 3. l. 37. p. A a 728. Fig.
728. Fig. Osmunda Regalis Ger. 971. fig. Osmunda Regalis sive Filix Florida Park. 1038. Fig.

This is an elegant Flowering Fern, bearing its Seed in branched Tufts at the top of its Leaves. It grows with us in rotten Moorish Grounds, and moist Woods.

Sect. II. Rheede, Grass, &amp;c. Ray 1235.

Spanish Rheed, Ray 1275. 2.

Arundo Cypria Jonst. 36. fig. 2. Arundo domestica C.B. in Matth. 137. fig. 1. Arundo sativa C.B. Theatr. 271. fig. Sativa que Donax Diosc. &amp; Theophr. CB. 17. 2. phyt. 40.3. Arundo maxima &amp; Hortensis Chabr. 193. Ic. 2. I. B. 2. l. 18. p. 486. fig. Harundo Donax Park. 1209. fig. 3. Harundo Cypria Ger. 32. fig. 2.

Our Angling Canes are made of this Rheed; its much bigger in all its Parts, and thicker than our common English Rheed. It grows very tall in the Bishop of London&#x27;s Garden at Fulham. They are brought to us from Spain, Cyprus, and other hot Countries.

Bobarts Drank or Haver-grass.

Festuca Avenacea sterilis spicis erectis Bobarti, Ray Syn. 237. edit. 2. p. 261. 3. Pluk. Tab. 299. fig. 2.

Mr Jacob Bobart first discovered this in the Hedges beyond Botley near Oxford, who hath lately sent it to the Physick Garden at Chelsea.

File Catstail Grass, Ray H. Pl. Vol. 3. p. 602. pl. 11.

Gramen spicatum instar Limae dentatum Hort. Catholic. §1. Gramen Typhinum spicis Limae instar alperis, é glumis minimè bicornibus compactis Ray H. Pl. V. 3. p. 602. 11.

I formerly observed this Grass with Dr Uvedale at Enfield, and this Summer in Chelsea Garden raised from Seed, which that accurate Botanist Monsieur Vaillant, sent me from Paris.

Soft Crested Grass, Ray 1265. 5.

Gramen Cristatum subhirsutum Park. 1159. 2. Gramen spicâ cristata subhirsutum C.B. 3. 2. prodr. 8. 19. I. B. 2. l.
Gramen montanum hirtutis folijs, spicâ leucophæâ diruptâ Pluk: Tab. 33. Fig. 7. Gramen pumilum hirsutum spicâ purpuro-argenteâ molli, Ray 1265. 5. Syn. 182. 4. ed. 250. 3.

This is thicker, softer, and more loose than our common Crested Grass, and in spike more nearly resembles our yellow Spring Grass: Dr Zuinger, Physician, and Son to the famous Professor of that Name, a very accurate Botanist, hath lately, amongst other curious Plants, sent me this Grass, which he gathered on the hilly Meadows about Basil, where Caspar Bauhine first discovered it. He says it grows with the common, but more rarely; the same found in the Woods there, he observes to sport or vary in its spike, viz. some more loose and greenish, others thicker and yellowish; the Leaves and Stalks in some are hairy, in others smooth. Dr John Jacob Scheutzer, that Curious Naturalist, has also observed it about Zurich, and from whom I received it by the Name of Gramen cum caudâ Muris purpurascente aliquatennus simile, l. B. 2. l. 18. p. 473. c. 106. So that here is 3 Plants reduced to one. Mr Dale and Mr Doody, who first observed it in England, and communicated it to Mr Ray and Dr Pluknet, took it for a new Grass. John Bauhine also, who found it in the sandy Fields and Paths near Mont-belgard, knew not that it was the same which his Brother Casper Bauhine had describ&#x27;d long before in his Prodomus, and first observ&#x27;d in the Woods about Cliben near Basil, from whence I lately received it.

Painted Grass, or Ladies Laces, Ray 1281. 9.

Gramen Paniculatum fol. variegato C B. Theatr. 37. fig. Names. 3. Panicul. aq. Phalaridis semine, folio variegato Insit. 523. Gramen striatum Ger. 24. Ic. 2. Jonst. 26. fig. opt. Gramen striatum vel sulcatum Park. parad. 457. fig. Gramen strijs pictum Chabr. 186. Ic. 4. I. B. 2. l. 18. p. 476.fig.

This pretty Grass is finely striped with green and white, and is a beautiful Ornament in most Gardens.
Lobel says, it grows wild on the Hills and Woods of Savoy.

Provence Grass with black Seed.

Gramen Paniculatum Provinciale, Aquilegiae semine Schol. Bot. 258. Pluk. Tab. 32. fig. 2. H. Ox. 2. p. 214. pl. 29. Gramen Panic. latifol. locustis crassioribus, sem. nigro Aquilegiae simili Inst. 522.

Dr. Sherard (now Consul of Smyrna) brought this Grass first into England; it hath grown in Chelsea Garden divers Years.

Sect. III. Plants with blink Flowers, Ray 154.

Canary Tree Sorrel, Ray 3. p. 116.

Acetosa arborescens subrotundo folio ex Insulis Fortunatis Pluk. Tab. 252. fig. 3.

This grows 3 or 4 Yards high with woody Stalks and round Leaves, continuing Green all the Winter. I have seen this in all the Curious Gardens about London, as Hampton Court, Fulham, Chelsea, Enfield, Mitcham, &amp;c.

Great Mountain Sorrel, Ray 178.2.

Acetosa montana maxima CB. 114.2 Phyt. 181. 2. max: Germanica Park. 742. Fig. 1. Oxalis major Broccenbergensis Thal. 82. Oxalis sylvatica maxima I. B. 2. l. 23. p. 990.

This is much larger than our common Sorrel. Mr Edward Lhwyd found it in Wales; it grows also on the Mountains of Savoy and Switzerland.

Indian Bladder Sorrel, Ray 179. 8:

Acetosa Americana, fol. longissimis pediculis donata C B. 114. 6. pr. 54. c. 18. 1. Acetosa vesicaria Americana Park. 744. 11. an Acetosa Indica Eiusd. 744. 10?

Its Beet-like Leaves and large Bladders, distinguish it from other Sorrels. This Plant is supposed to grow in Africa.
Africa and both the Indies. I have only seen it as yet from Asia, viz. Fort St George near the Coast of Malabar.

Common French Sorrel, Ray 180. 10.

Acetosa rotundifolia C B. Phyt. 182. 7. rotundif. hortensis C B. 114. 8. Oxalis rotundifolia Dod. Pempt. 649. Names. Fig. Oxalis folio rotundiore repens, Chabr. 311. Ic. 5. I. B. 2. l. 23. p. 991. Fig. Oxalis sativa, Francea, rotundifolia repens Lob. 292. Ic. 1. obs. 156. fig.

It grows on the Walls about Geneva in many Places, Place. and in the Cliffs of Rocks on the top of Mount Lupe near Sanel in Languedoc.

Grey French Sorrel.

Acetosa rotundifolia Hortensis, fol. glauco Boerhave Ind. Plant, H. Lugd. Bat. 184. 6. Names.

This differs from the common French Sorrel, only in having paler frosty Leaves.

Naples Sorrel, Ray 181. 15.

Acetosa Ocimi folio, Boucephalephora Col. 150. fig. Names. opt. Acetosa Ocimi folio Neapolitana C B. 114. 12. Acetosa Cretica sem. aculeato Ejusd. 114. 11. Phyt. 182. 10. descr. Park. 743. fig. 7. Oxalis minor aculeata Candia Chabr. 311. Ic. 6. I. B. 2. l. 23. p. 991. Fig.

This grows in several Parts of Spain, about Montpelier Place. and in the Balearick Isles, as well as in Candy and about Naples.

Catstail, curl&#x27;d Amaranth.

Amaranthus cristatus, ruber, Typhoides.

This is an elegant variety of Red Amaranth, with tail-like Tassels growing out of its Curls. I observed this the last Summer with the Curious Mr Charles Du Bois, amongst many other rare Plants in his Gardens at Mitcham.

Scate-tail&#x27;d Sicilian Amaranth, Ray 203. 7.

Cadelari Sicula Parietaria folijs Nobis. Amaranthus Siculus spicatus, radice perenni Bocc. 16. Tab. 9. Pluk. Tab. 260. fig. 2.
This is a new Species of *Amaranth*, which the *Malabars* call *Cadelari* with long slender Spikes, and its Seed Vessels hanging downwards. *Boccone* first discovered this about *Catanea* in *Sicily*, Mr *Alex. Brown* at the *Maderas*, and Dr *Sloane* in the Ditches about St. *Jago* in *Jamaica*.

Silver scaled, *Knot-grass*, Ray 185. 5.

*Polygonum minus candicans CB*, 281. 5. *Phyt*. 550. 3. *minus candicans supinum Bot. Monspel*. 209. *Polygonum mont. niveum &amp; sericeum H. Ox*. 592. 5. *Paronychia Hispanica Clusij* 478. Fig. *five Anthyllis nivea Chabr*. 452. Ic. 6. I. B. 3. l. 29. p. 347. Fig.

This spreads like our common *Knot-grass*, but differs in having many white skinny Membranes amongst its Leaves. Dr *Boerhave* marks this as an *Indigena* of *Holland*. Its very common on the Sea Coasts of *Spain* and *Languedoc*.

**Knotty Knavell.**

*Knavell nodosum Herniarie facie Nobis. an Polygonum capitulis ad genicula echinatis Bocc*. 40. Tab. 20.

This Plant does not well agree with *Boccone*s Figure or Description, his having many Leaves at each joint, and but 3 or 4 Branches from one Root; whereas this is as branched as common *Knot-grass*, and generally but one Leaf at each whirl, except towards the tips, where they are there sometimes 3 or 4. I observed this at Mr *Fairchild*s Garden at *Hoxton* from Seed, which Dr *Sherard* sent to the Reverend Mr *Wm. Stonestreet*.

**Sect. IV:** Plants with *Double* and *Radiated Flowers*.

**Jagged, Purple, Lettuce.**

*Lactuca altissima*, folio *Sonchi laciniato*, fl. parvo caeruleo *Boerhave* Ind. Plant. *Hort. Lugd. Bat*. 3. p. 21.
Its *Leaves* very like the *Jagged Sow-Thistles*, with Spoakey Tufts of Purple *Flowers* like the *Chondrilla carulea laciniata*. We are obliged to Dr Boerhave Botanick Professor of Leyden, for the Knowledge of this Specious Plant.

**Frosty-headed Hawkbeard.**

*Hieracium Aphacoides Cichorei folio, calyce glauco.*

Its lower *Leaves* are deeply cut like *Succory*, the Barbulæ, or Stalk leaves, are broad at the Base, with a Beard or two on each side, ending in a plain sharp Point, the Peculiarity in this Plant it its *glaucose* or *frosty Heads*, each Stalk ending in a single midling Flower. It heads from June till August.

**Great Egyptian Sow-thistle.**

*Sonchus Ægyptiacus Giganteus.*

The lower *Leaves* are very long, and deeply jagged, those which ride the Stalk are large and round at the Base, covering each side of the Stalk, and in all its parts much larger than our *Common Sow thistle*. This was raised from Seed which Mons. Vaillant sent me this Spring from the Royal Garden at Paris.

**Indian Sowthistle with curl’d Seed.**

*Sonchus Orientalis Lactucae folio, fl. luteo, semine ele- ganter crenato Boerhave 12. p. 23.*

This very much resembles the *Crepis Dalech Lugd 562.* but that the Flowers are larger, and Stalk swelled under the Calyx, which is composed of 2 or 3 ranges of broad pointed smooth Scales. The *Heads* turgid when the Seed are ripe, which are finely notch’d and curl’d. It *Flowers* from July till November.

**Tangier Sowthistle, Ray 1857,** *Sonchus Tingitanus Papaveris folio El. Bot. 377: Inst. Names.*

475. *Chondrilla Tingitana,* floribus luteis, *Papaveris Hort. folio Herm. H. Leyd. 659. fig. opti* Condrilla Tingitana fl. aureo, extus circa perianthium circulo purpureo nota-ta Hort. Bosian.
Its lower *Leaves* are like the *Garden Poppy*, which higher saddle or ride the Stalk. The *Flowers* yellow with a purple rim at the bottom; its scaley heads bottle like the *Sowthistles*. The whole Plant yields a hot and bitter *Milk*.

**Purple Italian Starwort.** *Ray* 268. 13.

*Aster Atticus Dod.* 266. fig. *Inguinalis Chabr.* 325. Ic.5. *Aster Atticus sive Amellus C.B. in Matth.* 817. fig.1. *carul. vulg.* C.B. 267. 1. *After Atticus purpureo flore I.B.* 2. 1. 24. p. 1044. fig. *After Atticus Italorum fl. purpureo Park.* 132. fig. *After Italorum Ger.* 392. fig. 2. *Jonst.* 486 Ic. 2. *Tinctoris flos 1. Tragi* 154. Fig.

Its a handsome *Bow-pot Flower*, and cultivated in most Gardens. It grows wild in Narbone, Italy, Sicily, &amp;c.

*Smirna Wooly Flea-burr.*

*Baccharis Smirnea folio subrotundo pannoso.* After *Verbasci folio, flor. minoribus nudis Sherard.*

This elegant Plant grows about a foot high; from a thick root, spreads many wooly, roundish, pointed thick *Leaves*, the largest somewhat more than an Inch long, but not quite so broad. These stand on woolly pedicles, the longest about an Inch and a half, above the midst of the Flower Stalk, come single yellowish naked *Heads*, each with a small Leaf, and both Stalkless, these branch a little towards the Top. Dr Sherrard, that accurate Botanist, and now *Consul of Smyrna*, sent me a Specimen from thence, since which I have seen it with the *Duchess of Beaufort* at *Chelsea*, who was pleased to make me a Present of it for our *Physick Garden*.

**White Canada Folesfoot.** *Ray* 292. 3.

*Cacalia Americana Park.* 1221. fig. 2. *Conyza Americana Urtice folio, flore albo El. Botan.* 361. *Inf.* 455. *Eupatorium Canad. Urticæ folio, flor. albo Herm. H. Leyd.* 667. *Eupatorium Urticæ folio, flor. albis Alm. Bot.* 140. *Valerian Urtice folio, fl. albo Cornut.* 20. fig.
Its a specious Plant, with opposite Nettle Leaves, and tufts of white thrummy Flowers. It grows in Canada and Virginia, where it Flowers in September, but in our Gardens much sooner.

Pyrenean Primrose Fleabane, Ray 3. p. 152. pl. 16 &amp; 17.

Its lower Leaves are like those of Primroses, but larger; the higher Ride or Saddle the Stalk, are clammy and smell strong, as does its Flowers, which are some rim&#x27;d, others naked, as Monsieur Tournefort has observ&#x27;d resembling the Plowmans Spikenard. Father Boccone found this on the Mountains of Bolonia, Modena and Tuscany. Dr Tournefort on the Pyreneans, and in Provence.

It grows plentifully on the Mountains about Geneva, and Flowers with us in May and June.

Small Rose-Marygold.

Asteriscus ramosus, flore minore.

This very well agrees with the Figure and Description of Chrysanthemum Conyzoides Lusitanicum Breyn. Cent. 157. c. 77. but there being several varieties of it mentioned by Dr Herman in his Hort. Leyd. p. 144. &amp;c. 658. as also by Tournfort in his Institut. p. 479. that its hard to determine which of them this is, and therefore till they are better known, I have chose to give it the Name above-mention&#x27;d.

Partly-leaved, Tooth&#x27;d Marygold, Ray 3. p. 228. 9.

This has often 5 Leaves like Elder, and is much taller than our English kind. It grows wild in Canada and Virginia.

Feaverfew Chamomill.

Chamaemelum montanum, Absinthij folio Parthenij odore Hort. Catholic.

These Leaves are green, and in their Segments resemble the Pyrethrum Canariense or Pellitory Dase. Its Flowers large, white, and one at the top of each Branch. Dr Vaillant, that accurate Botanist, sent me the Seed of this amongst many others, gathered in the Royal Garden at Paris.

Silver Chamomill.

Chamaemelum Absinthij Austriaci folijs argenteis.

Its lower Leaves finely cut, and silvery, out of which grows a single white Flower, at the top of each Stalk. I am obliged to Mr Jacob Bobart for the first Specimen of this elegant Plant; since which I have observed it in Chelsea Garden.

Clusius first observed this Plant about Vienna in Austria Of its everlasting Flowers they make Winter Nosegays, it thriving very well in divers Gardens.

Small Straw-Marygold with large Seed.

Xeranthemum fl. purpureo simplici minimo, semine maximo Flor. 1. Hort. Lugd. Bat.
This chiefly differs from the *Austrian Sneezewort*, in having very small Flowers, but large turgid Seed.

**Sect. V. Capitated and Nodiflorus Plants.**

It grows plentifully by Field sides and Vineyards in Salamanca, and Mr Jezreel Jones has observed it about Lisbon.

**Broad, Pale Eryngo.**

*Eryngium latifolium planum*, canle ex viridi pallescente fl. albo CB. 386. 7. Var.

Very like the Broad *Eryngo*, but has paler Stalks and white Flowers; it heads in July and August.

**Rawolph&#x27;s Syrian Eryngo.**

*Eryngium Syriacum ramosius*, capitulis minoribus Obart. Hist. Ox. p. 166. 13. *Eryngium caeruleum pumilum* Rawolph. Hort. sicc.

The lower Leaves are like the common *Mediterranean Eryngo*, but much less, and little more than trifid near the Root; it branches much and wide, with many small *starry Heads*, armed with 5 or 6 long and narrow strait *Spines*, with one often shorter than the rest. It Flowers in August and September. I find this Plant in a *Hortus Siccus*, made by that curious Botanist Mr John Banister, of the Plants he collected in the Physick Garden at Oxford, before he went to Virginia. The lower Leaves in
in this Specimen are almost round, which very well agrees with Mr Bobart&#x27;s Description, as does the rest of the Plant, with his and my own.

The Peculiarity of this Umbell, is to have its Root Leaves deeply cut, and those which ride the Stalk whole and round. Mr Ray observed this in Sicily, and Fabius Columna on the Mountains of Italy.

**Oriental Fennel Carrot.**

*Daucus Orient.* Feniculi folio. Myrrhis Orient. folio Names. angustiore Peucedani, sem. villoso Boer. 17. 11.

Its very fine Fennel Leaves and hoary Seed, distinguish it from what I have yet seen. Mr Jacob Bobart sent me the first Specimen of this from Oxford, since which I saw it with Flower and Seed in Mr Charles du Bois his Garden at Mitcham in Surrey.

Dr Tournefort in his Institutiones Rei Herbariae p. 325.
has given some of these Synonyms to the Cachrys sem.
fungoso sulcato plano majore, sive Peucedani angustis
Moris. contrary to the Opinion of that Author, and Mr
Bobart, who adds them to this Plant, whose Fennel
Leaves, yellow Flowers, and large smooth Seed distinguish
it from the other kinds. Dr Magnol has observ&#x27;d this
wild about Montpellier; it grows also on the Mountains
of Italy, Sicily and Crete. It flowers and seeds with us in
May, June, &amp;c.

Parsley Spignel. Meum Apij odore.

The Stalks of this are very brittle, and both they and
the Leaves have a Parsley smell.

Saxifrage Spignell. Meum Sefeli odore.

The Stalks of this are tough and have a mixt Smell be-
tween Meadow Saxifrage and Carrot.

This Plant, as it grows in Gardens very exactly resembles Columna&#x27;s Figure, both in its ramification and shape of its Leaves; but it more resembles Clusius his Figure, when it grows wild, as appears by a Specimen I have by me of Mr Ray&#x27;s own gathering, about Geneva: He also observ&#x27;d it about Mentz. It grows likewise in Italy and about Montpellier.

Ray 3. p. 302.8.

It much resembles our common Motherwort, but less, and with very small Flowers. It grows about a Yard high: Boccone first observed this wild near Florence, and afterwards in the Garden of that Noble Venetian and Patron of Botany Signor Christin Martinelli. It now grows in Chelsea Garden; from Seed I received this Spring from Monsieur Vaillant at Paris.

Borage-leav&#x27;d African Clary.

Sclarea Africana præcox annua Insf. Rei Herbaria 179.

Sclarea Africana amplissimo folio, annua Boerhave p. 64.17.

Its Leaves like Borage, lightly notcht, and one side larger than the other; its Stalks square, rough, and hairy; the Flowers large with a blue hood, out of which comes a long style forked at the end, the lower part of the Flower whitish; these stand at certain distances 3, 4 or 5 together, set in a large Husk, which surround but part of the whirl; they are of a pleasant grateful smell, and flourish from July, or sooner, until the midst of October.

The lower Leaves have often small Wings, with little purple Flowers, both which are very well represented by Clusius, and others that have coppied after his Icon. It grows wild in the mountainous Meadows of Austria and Styria, &amp;c.

Sherard&#x27;s Aleppo Clary.

Horminum Lampsanæ folio ex Aleppo.

Its Leaves larger and more wing&#x27;d than the German Clary, the Whirls naked or with very small Ears, purple above and green below; but what is very peculiar, they stand slanting or awry. It begins to Flower with us about June.

Small flower&#x27;d, Sage Clary.

Horminum minus, Salvia folio, fl. parvo.

Its lower Leaves like Sage, but somewhat larger; its Flowers small, pale within, but the Hood above of a deep blue; the upper Whirls are guarded with round pointed Leaves, as the Garden kind; the whole Plant has no manifest smell. It Flowers in August and September. Whether this Herb be described by any Author I am not certain. The 3d sort of Clusius his 2d Horminum, figured in his Stirpium Pannon. Histor. p. 582. would very well resemble it, were its lower Leaves finely serrated, instead of being waved. This Plant has been an old Inhabitant in Gardens, for I find a Specimen of it in the 1st Vol. p. 116. pl. 43. of Archbishop Sandcroft&#x27;s Collection of Padua Plants, which I guess to be made about A.D. 1650. It is also in Mr George Londor
don his Hortus Siccus p. 15. (which he composed in Dr Morifons time) under the Title of Stachys annua minima, where its Flowers are well expanded.

The Figures in these two last Authors very well resemble this Plant, which differs much from ours, which grows among the Corn in Yorkshire, as you may see by the Figure I have given of it in the Icons to Mr Ray&#x27;s English Plants, Tab. 33. Fig. 10. It grows wild in Germany, and some other Places of Italy.

Party-flowered Ironwort.

*Sideritis fl. parvo vario, calycibus acutis.*

Fabius Columna his Figure, the best agrees with this Plant of any I have yet seen, and is a variety of it, if not the same. I expect Plants and Seed of it from Italy, and then shall be better able to judge.

Its lower Leaves are round, but those on the Stalks vary much; some trifid, others with more points, both acute
acute and blunt; the Flowers pretty large, purplish, and with bifid petals. I observed this with Mr Charles Du-
bois at Mitcham, flowering in June and July.

Gooseberry Cape Mallow.

SECT.
Sect. XII. Plants with 4 or 5 leaved Flowers.

Narrow Silver Penny-Cress.

Alysson angustifolium albidum humifusum.

This is like the *Thlaspi Halimi folio sempervirens Herm.* H. Leyd. 595. fig. but spreads farther, with longer Branches and Leaves, which are whiter than the common Sea kind, Ray 829. 1.

Broad-leaved yellow Penny-Cress:

*Alysson luteum, Polygoni folio.*

Chabreus his Figure of *Thlaspi montaneum luteum* p. 292. Icon. 4. seems very well to resemble this Plant, whose Leaves are all whole, and none either serrated or jagged, which he says often happens; yet his Icon expresses the contrary. It Flowers and Seeds with us in July and August.

Its long and broad serrated Leaves, yellow Flowers, and slender Pods, distinguish it from others. It is common in Chelsea Garden.

White Mustard, Rocket.

*Eruca alba, Sinapi folio.*

This Plant resembles the Garden Rocket, but in its Flowers, which are all white without any Veins. It Flowers and Pods from July till September.

*Virginia Sciatica Cresses, Ray 827. 3.*

Centfoil Orientall Mothmullen.

Blattaria Orientalis Argemone folio. Verbascum Orientale Sophia folio Coral. 8.

Its deep cut Leaves that grow next the Root, with narrow ones at the coming forth of the Flowers, which are yellow, distinguish it from all others. A large Specimen of this elegant Plant I lately received from Dr. Vaillant at Paris; I also remember the Dutchess of Beaufort to have formerly shewn it me amongst her curious Collection of dry Plants raised at Badmington. It flowered this last Summer with Mr Charles du Bois at Mitcham.

This is a trayling Plant, with thick opposite Leaves, not unlike our Portulaca ag. nostras; it branches very much, and towards the top come small flesh coloured Flowers, standing on half Inch Pedicles. The whole Plant is clammy, and its branches tangle much. Mr. Samuel Daniel, Surgeon, first brought me this Plant from Rhodes, and the Seeds of it I communicated to Mr Charles du Bois, with whom it flowered A.D. 1697. and this last Summer again at Chelsea. Dr. Salvadore has also sent it me from Port Mahone in Minorca, one of the Balearick Isles.

Renatus
Renatus Morinus, a French Flowerist, first communicated this to Cornutus, who says it was brought from the Indies, but I rather believe it from the Cape of Good Hope in their Voyage Home, there being not one of this Species in all the 12 Volumes of the Hortus Malabaricus; but many from that fertile Promontory, and particularly of this kind and make, as the following.

This is an elegant and singular Plant, with very hairy Description. Leaves, and purple Borage-like Flowers. It was first discovered by Dr. Mycone, a Spanish Physician, on and near the Pyrenees, in shady moist mountainous Places, who says, a distill&#x27;d Water of it is very efficacious in breaking the Stone in the Kidneys or Bladder, and that the Spaniards drink the same against Coughs, for which reason they call it Terva Tussera, and also Pelada from the plenty of its Leaves.

Clusius
Clusius says the Tanners about Vienna, make use of this Shrub, to cleanse their Leather, as others do with Sumach: The Leaves are sold in the Markets of Spain and Italy, for great Sums to those that dress Spanish Leather. Gerard. The Bark is used by Tanners to dye yellow. Camerarius and others say the same of its Roots and Branches. It grows in the Hedges of Italy, Lombardy, &amp;c. where its flowers in May, and ripens its Seed in July and August, &amp;c.

Apple leaved Forreigner.

Mali folio, Arbor exotica.

Its Leaves grow opposite, finely notch with transparent Veins. This Tree has been several Years an Inhabitant in Chelsea Garden, but as yet without either Fruit or Flower.

This grew many Years with old Edward Morgan in his Garden behind the Palace at Westminster, as Doctor Pluknet testifies, who hath given a very good Figure of the Fruit, Seed and Leaves of this Tree, and has particularly taken notice of the welted Bark or Fungose excrescencies which grow to its Branches, as may yet be seen in a large Tree in the Bishop of London&#x27;s Garden at Fulham.

Virginia Sweet Gum.

Platanoides Virginiana Aceris folio auriculato.

This is distinguished from the melted, not only in having smooth twigs, but its younger leaves are remarkably auriculated at the base, and the upper point much narrower and often trifid, which has been nicely observed by that intelligent Person Mr Millward, my Lord Bishop of London&#x27;s present Gardiner, who very well understands the true Culture of Exotick Trees and Herbs, where this grows with the last.
