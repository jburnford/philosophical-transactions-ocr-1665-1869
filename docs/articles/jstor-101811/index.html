<div class="ocr-text">A New Invention of a Clock ascendent on a Plain inclin&#x27;d:
By Mr. De Gennes, an Officer belonging to the Sea. Extracted out of the Journal Des Scavans.

We have formerly seen Clocks, that never go, but when they are applied upon a Plain inclin&#x27;d. But we never yet saw any Clocks that wind up again of themselves upon the same Plain. There is to be seen in Mr. Cofpi&#x27;s Study, a Wooden Wheel, which works the same effect upon a Plain Inclin&#x27;d, invented by Mr. Bondoni, a Florentine Secretary to the said Marquis. But in regard M. Legati doth not unfold this secret; and for that M. de Gennes having found out the same, hath successfully apply&#x27;d it to a Clock; the manner hereof, which he communicated unto me,

Fig. 5.

The Circle FGH being placed upon a Plain Inclin&#x27;d, AB is divided into two unequal parts by the Line GL. To restore to the least Secture its equilibrium there is fastned to the extremity of the Radius DF, a Weight E, which is sufficiently heavy to recover what the lesser Secture loses by its situation. That a Wheel or Clock may thus stand not only in equilibrium, but also ascend upward, there is placed in the middle of the Clock a Drum, which encloses the spring of the Pendulum, upon which Drum is fasten&#x27;d the Radius DF. For thus the spring being mounted, enforces the Drum to turn, and so to raise the Weight, which it cannot raise, without its becoming more heavy, in regard that coming to the point E, it is farther from the Centre, than when it was in F, and thus all the Wheel turns on that side as the spring gives way.

M. de Gennes doth not here give direction how the Wheels that compose the Clock are to be made, because there
that no Clock-maker that doth not understand how to apply
the force of a spring to the motion of a Clock.

A New Engin to make Linen-Cloth without the help of an
Artificer, presented to the Royal Academy, by Monsieur de
Gennes, an Officer belonging to the Sea. Extracted out
of the Journal de Scavans

This Engin is no other than a Mill, to which are apply&#x27;d
all the parts of a Weavers ordinary Loom.
This Mill is composed of four principal parts, that is to
say, the Serpent $AA$, two Footsteps or Treddles $BB$, one
Clapper $C$, and two Arms $DDDD$.

The Serpent or Iron Barr $AA$ has two Elbows $EE$, where-
to the ends of the Ropes are fix&#x27;d that raise and put down the
Foot steps $BB$. $FF$ are two fourths of a Circle, that suc-
cessively rest upon two Arches or Bows of Iron $GG$, which
are above the Clapper $C$, to raise it. $HH$ are two Teeth of
Iron, added to the Serpent making an Angle of 25 degrees
with $FF$ and $KK$, which serve to put down a Bascule or
Sweep which is in the Arm that carries the Shuttle. The
Footsteps or Treddles differ in nothing from those which
are usually made use of, only the Cords that hold them pen-
dent from the ground are fixed in the Elbows of the Serpent,
which in turning raises and puts them down by the help of
two little pulleys, upon which the Ropes turn.

The Clapper is supported between two Pillars with a
Rope double twisted, which makes it to make a kind of a
Spring, and causes it naturally to give forwards to beat the
Cloth.

$L M$ is one of the Arms which pass freely into the Canal
or Pipe $NN$, supported by four Pillars of Wood $OOOO$.
The Motion of it proceeds from the following Parts.$P Q$ is
a Bascule which, though unequally divided by its supporter
$R$, is yet in Equilibrio, the end $PR$ being made to weigh
exactly as much as $RQ$.

At the Extremity of this Bascule is ty&#x27;d a Cord which
passes through the Pully $S$, and terminates at the Extremity
of the Arm, where it is fastned to a little Bowle $M$. At the
other Extremity of the same Arm that is to say towards $L$, is</div>
