<div class="ocr-text">II. An Account of the first Decade of a Book, Intituled, Johannis Martyn Historia Plantarum rariorum. Printed at London; by Richard Reily, 1728. by Mr. Rand, F.R.S.

Mr. Martyn in this Work has had the Plants, of their natural Bigness, exactly designed after the Life, and with great Accuracy and Success printed in their proper Colours. This curious Invention was never more aptly applied, though I think this is the first time it has been used in Botany. By this Means, without a long tedious Description, a Plant may be known by meer Inspection. However, that nothing may be wanting, the Author has thought fit to give short Descriptions, insisting more particularly on those minute Parts which cannot be so clearly expressed by Sculpture; and has added, where they could be obtain&#x27;d, some Account of their Uses, &amp;c.

The Plant in the first Table he calls Jalapa Officinarum.

The Jalap Root has been in common Use above a hundred Years; yet the Plant itself wholly unknown to us in Europe till P. Plumier and M. Lignon, who had both passed a considerable Time in America in Botanical Disquisitions, at their Return, severally assured Mr. Tournefort, that it was a Species of the Plant commonly known by the Name of Marvel of Peru; who thereupon thought fit to make Jalapa the Name of the Genus, and distinguish that of the Shops by the Seeds being more rugose than those of the common.

Tab. 2.
Tab. 2. Shews the Geranium Africanum, Arbore-
scens, Malvae folio lucido; flore elegantissi-
mo Kermesino Domini van Leur. Boerb.
Ind. alt. 262.

3. Geranium Chium, vernum; Caryophyllatae
folio T. Cor. 20.

4. Brunella Caroliniana, magno flore, dilute
caeruleo, internodiis praelongis, Phil. Trans.
No. 395. Pag. 125.

5. Amaranthus Sinensis folius variis; panicu-
la eleganter plumosa.

6. Amaranthus spicata albescente habitiore.

7. Parietaria Orientalis, Polygoni folio ca-
nescente T. Cor. 38.

8. Niruri Barbadense, folio Ovalis subtus glau-
co, pediculis florum brevissimis, Phil.
Trans. No. 399. Pag. 295.

This is of the same Genus with that called
Niruri, Hort. Malab. Tom. x. and there
described, p. 53. Ours is a much smaller
Plant, the Leaves are less, and grow much
closer on the Stalks, and the Pedicle of each
Flower by two thirds shorter.

9. Lychnidea Caroliniana floribus Umbellatim
dispositis, foliis lucidis crassis. This
Plant is something like Lychnidea Virgi-
niana Holofei ampliore folio, floribus
umbellatis purpureis Phil. Trans. No. 395.
Pag. 126. but the Leaves are much larger,
thicker, and of a deep shining green Colour.

10. Aloe Africana, foliis planis, conjugatis,
carinatis verrucosis, caule &amp; flore Co-
rallii colore Boerb. Ind. alt. p. 2. Pag. 131.

The
The ingenious Author proposes, in the Sequel of this Work, to give an Account of new Plants only, or at least such as have not been well figured by others: If he proceeds with the same Exactness, as I don&#x27;t doubt he will, the Work very well deserves Encouragement; for of Plants thus figured and described, there can be no future Doubts.

Happy had it been for us, had the Antients left such Types or Descriptions of those they recommended as considerable for their Use in Medicine. This would have saved the Learned World much Labour and Study in an Enquiry, which &#x27;tis to be feared, for want of such Helps, will prove unsuccessful.

III. An Attempt to solve the Phenomenon of the Rise of Vapours, Formation of Clouds and Descent of Rain. In a Letter from Dr. J.T. Desaguliers, L.L.D. F.R.S. to Dr. Rutty, R.S. Secr.

SIR,

The Reason of my writing upon a Subject which has been so often treated of, is, that none of the Accounts hitherto given of this Phenomenon (at least that I have met with) seem to me sufficient to solve all the Circumstances of it.

Dr. Nieventyt and some others say — That Particles of Fire separated from the Sun-Beams, by adhering to Particles of Water, make up Molecule, or small Bodies specifically lighter than Air, which therefore, by hydrostactical Laws, must rise and form Clouds that remain suspended when they are risen up to such an Height</div>
