<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">rently on Vine-branches, Cherry-Laurel, Plumb-trees, and the Cherry tree. The figure of the husks is round, save where it cleav&#x27;d to the branch; for bigness, somewhat more than half a grey pea. These, I say, cleave to their branches, as patella do to Rocks: For colour; they are of a very dark Chestnut, extremely smooth, and shining membran-like. They adhere most commonly to the under-side of a branch or twig, and so are best secure&#x27;d against the injuries of the weather, as too much Sun and Rain. They are well fastned to the branches single, and sometimes many in company. They are seldom found without vermin, as Pismires, &amp;c. which, I guess, pierce them and pray upon them. Thus much for the entire Coccum. If you open one of them, that is, cut off dextrously the top of the husk with a razor, you&#x27;ll find sometimes five or more small white magots of the Wasp or Bee-kind, that is, sharp at both ends. When these are carefully taken out, you will further observe the remainder of their provision of meat, and a partition &#x27;twixt them and the branch, where, what they excrete, is reserv&#x27;d. Lastly, if, when you have clear&#x27;d the Husk of Maggots, Bee-meat, and excrements, you then rub the empty membran upon white paper, it will freely and copiously tinge the paper with a beautiful purple or murrey. At the date of this, none of the Maggots were yet in nympha, so that you cannot expect from me a description of the Bee or Wasp they will turn to, when they come to perfection. Before the season be over, the Curious may satisfy themselves forthwith about it, and verify and improve it. Few Cherry-trees, I suppose, in any place, but will yield them some of these Berries. However, if they shall not be so fortunate as to light on them, I shall furnish you with them, &amp;c.
