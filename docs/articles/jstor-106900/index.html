Read May 1, 1794.

By what power is the eye enabled to view objects distinctly at different distances? As the pupil is enlarged or diminished according to the greater or less quantity of light, and in a certain degree to the distance of the object, it would readily occur that these different changes of the pupil would account for the phenomena in question. Accordingly anatomists and philosophers, who have written upon this subject, have generally had recourse to this explanation.

Amusing myself with these changes of the pupil, as a matter of curiosity, by presenting to the eye different objects at different distances, I soon perceived that its contraction and dilatation were irregular and more limited than had been supposed; i.e. that approaching the object nearer the eye, within a certain distance, the pupil not only ceased to contract, but became again dilated; and that beyond a few yards distance, it also ceased to dilate: these circumstances immediately occurred as objections to the above explanation; for were it from the contraction and dilatation of the iris alone that we see objects at different distances, I naturally concluded it should operate regularly to produce its effects; but if to view an object at a few yards distance it be enlarged to the utmost
extent, surely it must of itself be insufficient to view one at the distance of several miles; for example, the heavenly bodies.

Another difficulty here presents itself: in viewing the sun, instead of dilating, according to the distance, it contracts, obeying rather the quantity or intensity of the light, than the distance of the object. Knowing no other obvious power in the eye itself of adapting it to the different distances of objects, it occurred to me to inquire, whether the combined action of the external muscles could not have this effect. I first proposed this query to an optician of eminence in London, and who has written expressly on this subject. I repeated the same question to a celebrated teacher of anatomy. Encouraged by their replies, I have since attended more particularly to the subject, and hope my inquiries have not been altogether unsuccessful. As introductory to a more distinct view of what I have to advance, it appears necessary to premise the following observations, relative to those general laws of vision which are more particularly connected with this part of the subject, and to which we shall have occasion of frequent reference.

1st. Let A B C, (Tab. XVII. fig. 1.) be an object placed before the double convex lens D E, at any distance greater than the radius of the sphere whereof the lens is a segment; the rays which issue from the different points of the object, and fall upon the lens, will be so bent by the refractive power of the glass as to be made to convene at as many other points behind the lens, and at the place of their concourse they will form an image or picture of the object. The distance of the image behind the glass varies in proportion to the distance of the
object before the glass; the image approaching as the object recedes, and receding as that approaches. For if we suppose, (fig. 2.), A and B two radiating points, from which the rays A C, A D, and B C, B D, fall upon the lens C D, it is manifest that the rays from the nearest point A diverge more than those from the more distant point B, the angle at A being greater than that of B;* consequently the rays from A, whose direction is A E and A F when they pass through the glass, must convene at some point (as G) more distant from the lens than the point H, where the less diverging rays B K and B L from the point B are made to convene; which may also be proved by experiment with the common convex glass.†

It will be necessary to have this proposition in view, as we shall afterwards have occasion to use it in shewing, that by varying the distance between the retina and the anterior part of the eye we are enabled to see objects at different distances.

2d. If an object, as A B, (fig. 3.) be placed at a proper distance before the eye (E), the rays which fall from the several points of the object falling upon the cornea pass through the pupil, and will be brought together by the refractive power of the different parts of the eye on as many corresponding points of the retina, and there paint the image of the object, in the same manner as the images of objects placed before a convex lens are painted upon the spectrum, placed at a proper distance behind it; thus, the rays which flow from the point A are united on the retina at C, and those which proceed from B are collected at D, and the rays from all the intermediate points are convened at as many intermediate points of the

* Euclid, Book I. Prop. 21.
† See Kepler Diopt. Postul. Smith&#x27;s Optics, Gravesande, &amp;c.
retina; on this union of the rays at the retina depends distinct vision. But supposing the eye of a given form, should the point of union lie beyond the retina, as must be the case with those from the less distant object, agreeable to the preceding proposition; or should they be united before they arrive at the retina, as from the more distant object, it is evident that the picture at the retina must be extremely confused. Now as the rays which fall upon the eye from radiating points at different distances have different degrees of divergence, and the divergence of the rays increasing as the distance of the radiating point lessens, and, vice versa, lessening as that increases; again, as those rays which have greater degrees of divergence, viz. from the nearer objects, require a stronger refractive power to bring them together at a given distance than what is necessary to make those meet which diverge less, it is manifest, that to see objects distinctly at different distances, either the refractive power of the eye must be increased or diminished, or the distance between the iris and retina be varied, corresponding with the different distances of the objects; both of which probably take place, as will hereafter appear.*

Having then established these as our premises, we shall next examine the different principles which have been employed for explaining vision at different distances.

* &quot;Facile enim intelligitur, quo longius radii adveniunt, eo magis esse parallelos; eo minus ergo differre ab axi, et eo minoribus viribus cornæ et lentis crystallinæ in focum cogi. Ut enim corpus magis distat, ita sub minori angulo radii adveniunt. Contra si corpus conspicuum valde vicinum fuerit, radiorum ab eo advenientium angulus est major, et adeo magis divergentes in oculum incidunt, et viribus egent refringentibus majoribus omnibus densioribus.&quot;—Haller. Elem. Phys. lib. xvi.
Most writers upon this subject refer this power of the eye to the contraction and dilatation of the iris. Within certain limits this would, upon first examination, as already observed, appear to be the case, since the pupil enlarges as the object is further removed from the eye, and again contracts as it is brought near. The extent of this principle I have already pointed out; but I suspect we also err in attributing to the difference of distance what are only effects of different quantities of light, a circumstance in which it is the more easy to commit error as they are generally proportionate one to the other; i.e. as the object is near we require a less degree of light, and to exclude what is superfluous the iris contracts; but as it is more distant, a greater quantity of light becomes necessary, and the iris dilates: thus far we see the use of the enlargement or diminution of the pupil, as the object is more or less distant. But distinct vision does not consist in the quantity of light alone, though too much or too little would obscure the image.

It is also necessary that the rays which flow from the object should fall upon the retina in a certain direction, to form a distinct picture; but surely the greater or less quantity of light, the greater or less number of rays, which it is only the property of the iris to diminish or increase, cannot alter the direction.

But there is still another argument to prove, that the contraction or enlargement of the pupil is not of itself sufficient to produce distinct vision at different distances, viz. that the myopes, whose pupil contracts and dilates as in other eyes, are still unable to adapt the eye to different distances; and the means by which this is remedied certainly does not consist in
a larger or smaller aperture for the rays to pass through, but a power of altering their direction, which the change in the shape of the eye had rendered too convergent. The same fact is also observable in those who squint; the pupil in both eyes equally contracts and dilates, but still the vision of one eye is less perfect than the other. Another principle upon which it has been attempted to explain this power of the eye, is a supposed change in the convexity of the crystalline lens; the ancients had some obscure notion of it, but it has been lately pursued by Mr. Thomas Young, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions of London for 1793. He has endeavoured to demonstrate the existence of muscles in the crystalline lens, and by their action to account for distinct vision at different distances. This opinion deserves here the more particular examination, having met the attention of the Royal Society, and thereby likely to influence the general opinion upon this subject.

That we may not mistake the meaning of the author, I beg leave to premise his description of the structure of the lens. &quot;The crystalline lens of the ox,&quot; he observes, &quot;is an orbicular convex transparent body, composed of a considerable number of similar coats, of which the exterior closely adhere to the interior; each of these coats consists of six muscles, intermixed with a gelatinous substance, and attached to six membranous tendons. Three of these tendons are anterior, three posterior; their length is about two-thirds of the semidiameter of their coat; their arrangement is that of three equal and equidistant rays meeting in the axis of the crystalline; one of the anterior is directed towards the outer angle of the eye, and one of the posterior towards the
inner angle; so that the posterior are placed opposite to the middle of the interstices of the anterior, and planes passing through each of the six, and through the axis, would mark on either surface six regular equidistant rays. The muscular fibres arise from both sides of each tendon, they diverge till they reach the greatest circumference of the coat, and having passed it, they again converge till they are attached respectively to the sides of the nearest tendons of the opposite surface. The exterior or posterior portion of the six, viewed together, exhibits the appearance of three penniform-radiated muscles.&quot;

In the first place, to say nothing of the transparency of muscles, as an argument against their existence, we must unavoidably suppose, as they have membranous tendons, which Mr. Young informs us he distinctly observed, that these tendons cannot possess the same degree of transparency and density with the bellies of these muscles; that is, they must possess some degree of opacity, or certainly he could not have pointed out their membranous structure, nor even the tendon itself, as distinct from the body of the muscle; and if they have not the same density, from their situation, and being of a penniform shape, must there not be some irregularity from the difference in the refraction of those rays which pass through the bellies of those muscles, and those again which pass through their membranous tendons? This structure then, of consequence, cannot be well adapted for a body whose regular shape and transparency are of so much consequence.

Again, Mr. Young describes six muscles in each layer; but Leeuwenhoek, whose authority he admits as accurate, relative to the muscularity of the lens, is certainly more to be attended to in his observation of bodies less minute, viz. as to
the layers themselves, in which these muscles are found, and which of course are larger, and more easily observed; but, with his accuracy of observation, he has computed, that there are near 2000 laminae; and according to Mr. Young, supposing each layer to contain six muscles, we have necessarily, in all, 12,000 muscles; the action of which certainly exceeds human comprehension. I hope this will not be deemed trifling minuteness, as it is a necessary and regular consequence, if we admit their existence as described.

But secondly, as to the existence of these muscles, I cannot avoid expressing a doubt. With the utmost accuracy I was capable of, and with the assistance of the best glasses, to my disappointment, I cannot bear witness to the same circumstances related by Mr. Young, but found the lens perfectly transparent; at the same time, lest it might be attributed to the want of habit in looking through glasses, I beg leave to observe, that I have been accustomed to the use of them in the examination of the more minute objects of natural history. After failing with the glasses in the natural viscid state of the lens, I had recourse to another expedient; I exposed different lenses before the fire to a moderate degree of heat, by which they became opaque and dry; in this state it is easy to separate the layers described by Mr. Young; but although not so numerous as noticed by the accurate Leeuwenhoek, still they were too numerous to suppose each to have contained six muscles; for I could have shewn distinctly at least fifty layers, without the assistance of a glass, as was readily granted by those to whom I exhibited them.

But a circumstance which would seem to prove that these
layers possess no distinct muscles is, that in this opaque state they are not visible, but consist rather of an almost infinite number of concentric fibres (if the term be at all appropriate) not divided into particular bundles, but similar to as many of the finest hairs of equal thickness, arranged in similar order: see fig. 4, 5, and 6, where the arrangement of the layers and fibres has been painted from the real lens of an ox, and that without the assistance of a glass. To observe this fact, any person may try the experiment at pleasure, and witness the same with the naked eye, even separating many layers and their fibres with the point of a penknife.

This regular structure of layers, and those consisting of concentric fibres, is unquestionably better adapted for the transmission of the rays of light, than the irregular structure of muscles. It may, perhaps, be urged, that the heat to which I exposed the lens may have changed its structure: in answer to that I observe, it was moderate in degree, and regularly applied; of consequence we may presume, as it appeared uniformly opaque, that every part was alike acted upon; but by boiling the lens, where the heat is, without doubt, regularly applied, we observe the same structure.

Thirdly, that it is not from any changes of the lens, and that this is not the most essential organ in viewing objects at different distances, we may also infer from this undeniable fact, that we can, in a great degree, do without it; as after couching or extraction, by which operations all its parts must be destroyed, capsule, ciliary processes, muscles, &amp;c.

Mr. Young asserts, from the authority of Dr. Porterfield, that patients, after the operation of couching, have not
the power of accommodating the eye to the different distances of objects; at present, I believe the contrary fact is almost universally asserted.*

Besides, if the other powers of the eye are insufficient to compensate for the loss of this dense medium, the lens, a glass of the same shape answers the purpose, and which certainly does not act by changing its figure. I grant their vision is not so perfect; but we have other circumstances upon which this can be more easily explained; which will be particularly noticed under the next head. It may not be improper also to observe, that the specific gravity of the crystalline compared with that of the vitreous humour, and of consequence, its density and power of refraction, is not so great as has been generally believed. Dr. Bryant Robinson, by the hydrostatic balance, found it to be nearly as 11 to 10. I have also examined them with the instrument of Mr. Schmeisser, lately presented to the Royal Society, and found the same result; of consequence the crystalline lens is not so essentially necessary for vision as has been represented; especially as it is also probable, that upon removing it, the place which it occupied is again filled by the vitreous humour, whose power of refraction is nearly equal. At the same time we cannot suppose the lens an unnecessary organ in the eye, for nature produces

* &quot;Et lente ob cataractam extracta vel deposita oculum tamen ad varias distantias videre, ut in nobili viro video absque ullo experimento quo eam facultatem recuperat verit. Etsi enim tunc ob diminutas vires quae radios uniunt, æger lente vitrea opus habet, eadem tamen lens in omni distantia sufficit.&quot;—Haller, El. Phys.

&quot;La lentille cristalline n’est cependant point de première nécessité pour la vision. Aujourd’hui, dans l’opération de la cataracte on l’enlève entièrement, et la vision n’en souffre point.&quot;—De la Metherie Vues Physiologiques. See also De la Hire, Hambberger Physiolog.
nothing in vain; but that it is not of that indispensable importance, writers upon optics have taught us to believe.

Fourthly, Mr. Young tells us, he has not yet had an opportunity of examining the human crystalline; and grants, that from the spherical form of it in the fish, such a change as he attributes to the lens in quadrupeds cannot take place in that class of animals. The lenses which I have examined in the manner abovementioned were the human, those of the ox, the sheep, the rabbit, and the fish, and in all the same lamellated structure is observable; even in the spherical lens of the fish these lamellæ are equally distinct, but without the smallest appearance of a muscle.

From these circumstances I cannot avoid the conclusion, that they do not exist; at the same time I am persuaded that Mr. Young met with appearances which he supposed were muscles; but I am satisfied he will readily acknowledge, that the examination of the crystalline lens in its viscid glutinous state, is not only attended with much difficulty, but that the smallest change of circumstances might lead to error; which I apprehend may, probably, have been the case in that instance.

Upon examining it after boiling, or exposing it to a gradual degree of heat before the fire, when it may be handled with freedom, he will readily observe (without a glass) the numerous lamellæ, and the arrangement of their fibres, which I have described.

Another opinion has been sanctioned by many respectable writers, of the effects of the ciliary processes in changing the shape and situation of the lens; some supposed it to possess the power of changing the figure of the crystalline, rendering
it more or less convex;* others, that it removed it nearer to the cornea;† and others, that it removed it nearer the retina.‡

The advocates for these different opinions all agree in attributing these effects to a supposed muscularity of the ciliary processes.

Of the structure of these processes Haller observes, &quot;In omni certe animalium genere processus ciliares absque ulla musculosa sunt fabrica, mere vasculosi vasculis serpentinis percursi molli facti membrana.&quot; Which structure, I believe, at present is universally admitted. But even supposing them muscular, such is their delicacy of structure, their attachment, and direction, that we cannot possibly conceive them adequate to the effects ascribed to them. Beside, what we observed of the muscles of the lens itself, also applies to the processes, viz. that they may be destroyed, as in couching or extraction, and yet the eye be capable of adapting itself to the different distances of objects. For a more full refutation of these opinions, see Haller&#x27;s large work.

The Situation, Structure, and Action of the external Muscles.§

Upon carefully removing the eyelids, with their muscles, we are presented with the muscles of the eye itself, which are six in number; four called recti, or straight; and two oblique;

§ For the accuracy of the representation I have annexed (in Tab. XVIII.) I can vouch, having been at much pains in the dissection; from which I had the painting taken by a most accurate hand, Mr. S. Edwards, a gentleman well known for his abilities in the plates of that admirable work, the Flora Londinensis.
so named from their direction, (see Tab. XVIII. fig. 1.) A A A A, the tendons of the recti muscles, where they are inserted into the sclerotic coat, at the anterior part of the eye. B, the superior oblique, or trochlearis, as sometimes called, from its passing through the loop or pulley connected to the lower angle of the orbiter notch in the os frontis; it passes under the superior rectus muscle, and backwards to the posterior part of the eye, where it is inserted by a broad flat tendon into the sclerotic coat. C, the inferior oblique, arising tendinous from the edge of the orbiter process of the superior maxillary bone, passes strong and fleshy over the inferior rectus, and backwards under the abductor to the posterior part of the eye, where it is also inserted by a broad flat tendon into the sclerotic coat. D D D, the fat in which the eye is lodged. In fig. 2. we have removed the bones forming the external side of the orbit, with a portion of the fat, by which we have a distinct view of the abductor. A B C, three of the recti muscles, arising from the back part of the orbit, passing strong, broad, and fleshy over the ball of the eye, and inserted by flat, broad tendons into the sclerotic coat, at its anterior part. D, the tendon of the superior oblique muscle. E, the inferior oblique, fig. 3. A, the abductor of the eye. B, the fleshy belly of the superior oblique, arising strong, tendinous, and fleshy from the back part of the orbit. C, the optic nerve. D and E, the recti muscles.

The use ascribed to these different muscles, is that of changing the direction of the eye, to turn it upwards, downwards, laterally, or in any of the intermediate directions, accommodated either to the different situation of objects, or to express the different passions of the mind, for which they are
peculiarly adapted. But is it inconsistent with the general laws of nature, or even with the animal oeconomy, that from their combination they should have a different action, and thus an additional use? To illustrate this we need only witness the action of almost any set of muscles in the body; for example, in lifting a weight, the combined action of the muscles of the arm, shoulder, and chest, is different from the individual action of either set, or of any individual muscle; or an instance nearer our purpose may be adduced, viz. the actions of the muscles of the chest and belly, making a compression upon the viscera, as in the discharge of urine, faeces, &amp;c. But to question this fact would be to question the influence of the will in any one of the almost infinite variety of motions in the human body.

I presume, therefore, it will be admitted that we have the same power over these muscles of the eye as of others, and I believe we are no less sensible of their combined action; for example, after viewing an object at the distance of half a mile, if we direct our attention to an object but ten feet distance, every person must be sensible of some exertion; and if our attention be continued but for a short time, a degree of uneasiness and even pain in the ball of the eye is experienced; if again we view an object within the focal distance, i.e. within six or seven inches, such is the intensity of the pain that the exertion can be continued but a very short time, and we again relieve it by looking at the more distant objects; this, I believe, must be the experience of every person, whose eyes are in the natural and healthy state, and accordingly has been observed by almost every writer upon optics.

But the power of this combination, even from analogy,
appears too obvious to need further illustration. I shall therefore next endeavour to point out their precise action.

Supposing the eye in its horizontal natural position; I see an object distinctly at the distance of six feet, the picture of the object falls exactly upon the retina; I now direct my attention to an object at the distance of six inches, as nearly as possible in the same line; although the rays from the first object still fall upon my eye, while viewing the second, it does not form a distinct picture on the retina, although at the same distance as before, which shews that the eye has undergone some change; for while I was viewing the first object I did not see the second distinctly, although in the same line: and now, vice versa, I see the second distinctly, and not the first; the rays from the first, therefore, as they still fall upon the eye, must either meet before or behind the retina; but we have shewn that the rays from the more distant object convene sooner than those from the less distant object, therefore the picture of the object at six feet falls before, while the other forms a distinct image upon the retina; but as my eye is still in the same place as at first, the retina has by some means or other been removed to a greater distance from the fore part of the eye to receive the picture of the nearer object, agreeable to the principle page 198. From which it is evident, that to see the less distant object either the retina should be removed to a greater distance, or the refracting power of the media should be increased: but I hope we have shewn that the lens, which is the greatest refracting medium, has no power of changing itself. Let us next inquire, if the external muscles, the only remaining power the eye possesses, are capable of producing those changes. With respect to the
anterior part of the eye, we have seen the situation of those muscles; the recti strong, broad, and flat, arising from the back part of the orbit, passing over the ball as over a pulley, and inserted by broad flat tendons at the anterior part of the eye; the oblique inserted toward the posterior part, also by broad flat tendons; when they act jointly, the eye being in its horizontal position, it is obvious, as every muscle in action contracts itself, the four recti by their combination must necessarily make a compression upon the different parts of the eye, and thus elongate its axis, while the oblique muscles serve to keep the eye in its proper direction and situation. For my own part, I have no more difficulty in conceiving of this combination of those muscles than I have at present of the different flexors of my fingers in holding my pen. But other corresponding effects are also produced by this action; not only the distance between the anterior and posterior parts of the eye is increased, but of consequence the convexity of the cornea, from its great elasticity, is also increased, and that in proportion to the degree of pressure, by which the rays of light passing through it are thence necessarily more converged. But another effect, and one not inconsiderable, is, that by this elongation of the eye, the media, viz. the aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous humours through which the rays pass, are also lengthened, of consequence their powers of refraction are proportionably increased; all which correspond with the general principle. It may however be said, that as the four recti muscles are larger and stronger than the two oblique, the action of the former would overcome that of the latter, and thus draw back the whole globe of the eye; but does not the fat at the posterior part of the orbit also afford a resistance
to the too great action of the recti muscles, especially as it is of a firm consistence, and the eye rests immediately upon it? Admitting then that this is the operation of the external muscles when in a state of contraction, it is also to be observed, we have the same power of relaxing them, in proportion to the greater distance of the object, until we arrive at the utmost extent of indolent vision.

But, as a further testimony of what has been advanced, I had recourse to the following experiment, which will shew that the eye is easily compressible, and that the effects produced correspond with the principles I have endeavoured to illustrate.

With the common speculum oculi I made a very moderate degree of pressure upon my eye, while directing my attention to an object at the distance of about twenty yards; I saw it distinctly, as also the different intermediate objects; but endeavouring to look beyond it, every thing appeared confused. I then increased the pressure considerably, in consequence of which I was enabled to see objects distinctly at a much nearer than the natural focal distance; for example, I held before my eye, at the distance of about two inches, a printed book; in the natural state of the eye I could neither distinguish the lines nor letters; but upon making pressure with the speculum I was enabled to distinguish both lines and letters of the book with ease.

Such then I conceive to be the action and effects of the external muscles, and which I apprehend will also apply in explaining many other phænomena of vision; some of those it will not be improper at present briefly to notice.

First, may not the action of those muscles have more or less effect in producing the changes of vision which take place
in the different periods of life? At the same time the original conformation of the eye, the diminution of its humours, and, probably, of the quantity of fat upon which the eye is lodged, are also to be taken into the account. But the external muscles becoming irregular and debilitated by old age, in common with every other muscle of the body, are not only incapable of compensating for these losses, but cannot even perform their wonted action, and thus necessarily have considerable influence in impairing vision. Again, does not the habit of long sight so remarkable in sailors and sportsmen, who are much accustomed to view objects at a great distance, and that of short sight, as of watchmakers, seal-cutters, &amp;c. admit of an easy solution upon this principle? as we know of no part of the body so susceptible of an habitual action as the muscular fibre.

Secondly. How are we to account for the weaker action of one eye in the case of squinting? That this is the fact has been well ascertained; Dr. Reid * upon this subject observes, that he has examined above twenty persons that squinted, and found in all of them a defect in the sight of one eye. Porterfield and Jurin have made the same observation.

The distorted position of the eye has, I believe, been generally attributed to the external muscles; but no satisfactory reason has ever been given why the eye, directed towards an object, does not see it distinctly at the same distance as with the other. The state of the iris here cannot explain it, as it contracts and dilates in common with the other; nor can we suppose any muscles the lens might possess could have any

* See his Inquiry into the Human Mind, page 322.
effect, as they are not at all connected with the nature of this disease.

But the action of the external muscles, I apprehend, will afford us a satisfactory explanation. When the eye is turned from its natural direction, for example, towards the inner canthus, it is obvious that the adductor muscle is shortened, and its antagonist, the abductor, lengthened; consequently, as the abductor has not the same power of contracting itself with the adductor, when the eye is directed towards an object, their power of action being different and irregular, the compression made upon the eye and its humours must also be equally irregular, and therefore insufficient to produce the regular changes in the refraction and shape of the eye we have shewn to be necessary in adapting it to the different distances of objects. The effects produced by making a partial pressure upon the eye with the finger, or speculum oculi, before noticed, would also appear to favour this explanation.

Thirdly. May it not in part be owing to the loss of this combined action of the external muscles, and the difficulty of recovering it, that the operation of couching is sometimes unsuccessful, especially when the cataract has been of long standing? This cannot be attributed to the iris, for it perhaps, dilates and contracts as before: nor to the muscles of the lens, for they are removed; nor to the state of the nerve, for it is still sensible to light; and yet the patient cannot see objects distinctly; and it is not an uncommon circumstance, even when the operation succeeds, that the sight is slowly and gradually recovered. Instances have occurred, Mr. Bell*

* See his System of Surgery.
Dr. Hosack&#x27;s Observations on Vision.

observes, of the sight becoming gradually better for several months after the operation.

When we have been long out of the habit of combining our muscles in almost any one action of life, as walking, dancing, or playing upon a musical instrument, we in a great measure lose the combination, and find a difficulty in recovering it, in proportion to the length of time we had been deprived of it; but the individual action of each muscle remains as before. Thus, probably, with the muscles of the eye. A variety of facts of a similar nature must present themselves to every person conversant in the science of optics, which may admit of a similar explanation.

I have thus endeavoured, first, to point out the limited action of the iris, and of consequence the insufficiency of this action for explaining vision. Secondly, to prove that the lens possesses no power of changing its form to the different distances of objects. Thirdly, that to see objects at different distances, corresponding changes of distance should be produced between the retina and the anterior part of the eye, as also in the refracting powers of the media through which the rays of light are to pass. And, fourthly, that the combined action of the external muscles is not only capable of producing these effects, but that from their situation and structure they are also peculiarly adapted to produce them.

Is it not then consistent with every principle in the œconomy of nature and of philosophy, seeing the imperfections of the principles which have hitherto been employed in explaining the phænomena in question, to adopt the one before us, until (agreeable to one of the established rules in philosophizing)
other phænomena occur, by which it may be rendered either more general, or liable to objections?

I have now finished what was proposed. I have declined entering into an extensive view of the structure of the eye, or any of the general principles of optics, as those subjects have been more ably treated in the works already cited, and thus would certainly have destroyed every claim to attention, which these few pages in their present form may possibly possess; and if I should be so fortunate as to succeed in establishing the principle I have proposed, for explaining the phænomena dependent upon this more important organ of our body (if any part possesses a pre-eminence in nature), I also hope it may, in abler hands, admit of some practical application, in alleviating the diseases to which its delicate organization so particularly exposes it.*

* Since the above pages have been written, I have found, upon consulting some of the earliest writers, that the effects of the external muscles did not altogether escape their attention; at the same time they had no distinct idea of their action: I must therefore disclaim the originality of the thought, although I had never met with it before the circumstances already noticed, of the insufficiency of the iris, had suggested it. If, however, I have succeeded in pointing out the precise action of those muscles, and its application to the general principles of vision, in which, I believe, I have never been anticipated, it will be the height of my wishes.
