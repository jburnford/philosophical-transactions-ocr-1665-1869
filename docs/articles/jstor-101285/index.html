<div class="ocr-text">4. I have often noted some that are short-sighted, I say not pore-blind, to discern all things that are done about them, almost quite behind them, more perfectly than the best-sighted, if the room was not too large for the reach of their sight.

5. Also some of Dr. Lowes Observations I could confirm by my own experience. In my youngest days I had a very narrow escape from an excellent Horse, which had that only defect, which they call Moon-blind (and they told me of it after the mischief.) I purpos&#x27;d to leap a Ditch, but the Horse saw no Ditch, so we fell in together. As Coach-and Cart-horses have flaps on the Ear-sides of their eyes, so these flaps may be fitted (and in some shew of ornament) to shadow the over-part of the eyes, and yet to afford them light enough to see their way. I know not, whether it be usual amongst you; but I have seen a young Child wear a kind of black Riband, like a narrow Masque before her eyes, the Riband or Maske having holes made in fit places to guide the eye. And this was said to be an effectual remedy to cure the Child of Squinting, which she had hereditarily from her Mother.

To conclude, for your trial of the Tubulous spectacles; the Tubes may be of paper only colored black, and pasted on, and with the inner folds to be drawn out from one inch to three; some of the folds to be taken out, that the orifice may be wider or narrower, as best fits to every degree of defect.

Of the Antiquity of the Transfusion of Blood from one Animal to another.

There hath been of late some contest about the Origin of the Transfusion, the English first claiming it as a late Invention of theirs; the French pretending thereupon, that it had been proposed among them ten years agoe: after which, it was affirm&#x27;d upon further investigation, by some ingenious persons in England, that there it had been known 30 years agoe; whereof the Publisher of these Tracts hath good proof in his hands. But it seems, that an Italian Philosopher, in a certain Tract, entitled, Relazione dell&#x27; Esperience fatte in Inghilterra, Francia &amp; Italia intorno alla Transfusione del Sangue, lately printed in Rome, (for the notice whereof.
whereof we are obliged to the Author of the Journal des Scavans) undertakes to prove, that the Transfusion is yet of greater Antiquity, as having been known to Libavius above 50 years since. For which, that Roman Author alledgeth a place out of the said Libavius (in Defensione Syntagmatis Arcanorum Chymicorum contra Heningum Schnecmannum, actione 2, pag. 8. Edit. Francos. A. 1615.) where the Transfusion is so plainly described, that one can hardly discourse of it with more clearness, than there is done, in these words: Adsit (saith Libavius l. c.) Juvenis robustus, sanus, sanguine spirituoso plenus: Adstet exhaustus viribus, tenuis, macilentus, vix animam trahens. Magister artis habeat tubulos argenteos inter se congruentes, aperiat arteriam robusti, &amp; tubulum inserat munitaque; mox &amp; agroti arteriam findat, &amp; tubulum famineum infigat. Fam duos tubulos sibi mutuo applicet, &amp; ex sane sanguis arterialis, calens &amp; spirituosus saliet in agrotum, unaque vite fontem afferet omnemque languorem pellet. This indeed is clear enough, and obliges us to averre a greater antiquity of this operation, than before we were aware of; though &#x27;tis true, Libavius did not propose it but only to mock at it (which is the common fate of new Inventions, in their Cradle;) besides that he contrives it with great danger, both to the Recipient and Emittent, by proposing to open Arteries in both; which indeed may be practised upon Brutes, but ought by no means upon Man.

Mr. Gregories Answer

To the Animadversions of Mr. Hugenius upon his Book, De vera Circuli &amp; Hyperbolae Quadratura; as they were publish&#x27;d in the Journal des Scavans of July 2. 1668.

This Answer we shall give the Reader in the same Language and Words, in which the Author of it desired, it might be inserted in this Tract, viz.

Ad ea qua dicit D. Hugenius contra meam Circ. &amp; Hyperb. Quadraturam, ingenue fatior (cum illa scriberem) me non animadvertisse exemplum in prop. 10. non esse seriem convergentem; experientiam enim feci sollemmodo de primis &amp; secundis terminis, non considerando tertios cum primis coincidere; nam ratiociniis insuffebam, de exemplis parum solicitus: Ut autem appareat in hoc nihil contineri contra nostram Doctrinam, agendum hoc loco 10. prop. totidem verbis, sed cum legitimo exemplo, repetamus,
