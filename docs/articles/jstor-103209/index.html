XXXV. A Relation of a Scirrhous Tumour, included in a Cystis, &amp;c. By Mr. Richard Russell, Surgeon, at Lewes in Sussex; and communicated by Mr William Chefelden, Surgeon, F.R.S.

August the 18th, 1713. I was sent for to Mrs. Smith, who had been reduc&#x27;d very low by a Fever, which from her Cough, sharp Pain under her Breast, and other Symptoms was judg&#x27;d Pleuritick.

But upon having a Discharge from her painful Breast, of a thin Gleet, all Symptoms vanished.

When I saw her first, the Liquor discharg&#x27;d by a small Pin-hole near the Papilla, was little more than would have wet a Handkerchief four times double.

Examining of the Breast, I found a large Tumour, that lay deep, yielding to my Fingers, and pasting like Dough.
I search&#x27;d the Abscess with my Probe, and twisted out with it a Matter like Saw-dust; or Brann, mix&#x27;d with Hair.

Upon laying open the Breast, I separated a Cystick Tumour, which weigh&#x27;d eight Ounces, and contain&#x27;d a solid Matter like the above-mention&#x27;d, mix&#x27;d with a Body like Hair.

Upon Enquiring into the manner of its coming, she told me, that eight and thirty Year ago, she receiv&#x27;d a Bruise in that Breast by a Fall from a Horse, which was attended with great Pain and Fluxion; in much, that the Veins of her Breast appear&#x27;d Varicous and Turgid, as in a Cancer; but her Pain ceasing, they sunk, and left an Indolent Tumour in her Breast, suppos&#x27;d by her Surgeon to be a true Scirrhus: Since which time it hath always continued nearly in the same State, without pain, increasing very little in Magnitude, but obstructed in such a manner that she could not nurse her Child with that Breast.

The Tunic was pretty thick, nourished with very small Vessels, but had form&#x27;d a Scirrhus of the Glands it adher&#x27;d to, by keeping up a Distention of Parts, till there was a Cohesion of their Membranes and Vessels.

I make no doubt, but this was a Body of diseas&#x27;d Glands, which had suffer&#x27;d a Colliquation by some extravasated Fluid, and that the Membrane of the Tumour was their Proper Tunic.

After this manner all our Tunicated Tumours seem to be form&#x27;d; for when an Obstruction proceeds to Extravasation, there is a Liquor pour&#x27;d out which consists of such Particles, that by degrees makes a Colliquation of the Glandulous Flesh, which is not very sensible of Pain; and by degrees the Capsula becomes distended with a Matter of a very different Consistence, which
which gives the Name to the Tumor, either Steatoma, Atheroma, or Meliceris.

Thus pour Oyl of Olive on Spirit of Nitre, and your Oyl first becomes a little hardened, then of the Colour and Consistence of Marrow, till by degrees it is hardened into a white Fat, resembling that of Animals.

The Possibility of this Colliquation and Digestion, we may the easier be induc&#x27;d to believe, if we consider how often we find the Glands of the Viscera petrified, without any degree of Pain, or the Membrane in any Measure destroy&#x27;d: The Truth of which, every one that hath been conversant with the Dissection of Morbid Bodies, must have seen.

XXXVI. An Extract of a Letter from Francis Nevill, Esq; to the Lord Bishop of Clogher, F. R. S. concerning a Quarry of Marble discover&#x27;d by him in the County of Farmanagh in Ireland.

Belturbet, October 14. 1712.

My Lord,

Mr. Cole and I were lately in the Mountains, where I had discovered a Marble Quarry. The Country wherein it lies is so strange for the Natural Wonders in it, that &#x27;twould make a little History to describe all that is to be seen. It lies on the North-side of Calcagh, in the Parish Kilashier, and County of Farmanagh. There are Marble Rocks, whose Perpendicular</div>
