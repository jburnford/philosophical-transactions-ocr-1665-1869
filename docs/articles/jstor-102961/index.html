<div class="ocr-text">V. An Account of a Book.
Apicij Cælij de Opsonijs &amp; Condimentis sive Arte Coquinanaria Libri Decem.
Cum Annotationibus Martini Lister è Medicis Domesticis Serenissimae Majestatis Reginae Annae, &amp; Variis Lectionibus integris Humelbergij, Barthij, &amp; Variorum.
Londini: 1705. 8vo.

The Learned World hath been already oblig&#x27;d to the Ingenious Editor for his Notes upon Sanctorius, and Hippocrate&#x27;s Aphorisms; yet in this Edition of Apicius he is pleas&#x27;d to give further proofs of his generosity in serving the Republick of Letters.

His Preface may be justly call&#x27;d a Critical Introduction to the History of Apicius, as to his Country, his Age, his Design, and the Various Editions of him, at Venice, Basil, Lyons, and Zurich; amongst which many doubts are clear&#x27;d up, and the Annotations themselves of Dr Lister will appear as Valuable as those of the most profess&#x27;d Criticks, He being intent upon Things, and They too frequently upon Words.

After the Prolegomena come the X Books of Apicius under their distinct Titles, with the Scholia and Notes of G. Humelbergius, C. Barthius, Dr Lister, and others; amongst which are interspers&#x27;d several Remarks of J. Casaubon, Salmasius, Nonnus, &amp;c. all distinguish&#x27;d in the several Columns of this beautiful Edition.

Amongst these, the Reader will meet with many passages of the Ancients illustrated, and set in a true light; especially Horace, Celsus, Scribonius Largus, Dioscorides, Pliny, Athenaeus, Celsus Aurelianus, Martial, Petronius, The Rei Rusticae Scriptores the Geponici, and many others. At the End there is a very particular and compleat Index, of great Use in a Work of such Variety of Words and Matter, as must needs occur in the Dietetic Medicine.

&#x27;Twas thought proper to Print only 120 Copies of this Piece, to satisfy the Curious, (who may be very few) at the expense of some Noble and Liberal Subscribers, whose Names are affixt on the back of the Title Page; after the manner of publishing Mr Lhwyd&#x27;s Lithologia Britannica, in the year 1699. London. 8vo.

Printed for Sam. Smith and Benj. Walford, Printers to the Royal Society, at the Princes Arms in St Paul&#x27;s Church-yard, 1705.</div>
