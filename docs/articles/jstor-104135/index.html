VIII. A Letter from Sir Tho. Mostyn, Bart. to Roger Jones, M. D. F. R. S. concerning a golden Torques found in England.

SIR, Gloddeth, Dec. 27. 1741.

I have received the Favour of your Letter, wherein you desire to be informed of the Particulars of my Torques. I wish I were able to give you a better Account, but have never seen nor heard of any Remarks made upon it, or any Account where it was found, but I think it was in this County. It is a Wreath of Gold, weighing, as near as I can judge, nine Ounces. I believe it is without Alloy, being very pliable; it answers exactly Virgil&#x27;s Description, Æn. V. 558 and 559.

Pars leves humero pharetras: it pectore summo
Flexilis obtorti per collum circulus auri.

It being joined here with the Pharetta, and being very proper for carrying a Quiver, inclines me to think, that the Gauls, from whom the Romans took it, used it for that Purpose; but among the latter it seems to have been worn as an Ornament, rather than a thing of Use. There are several Passages in the Hist-
Historians, which mention its being given as a Reward for military Service. It is sometimes described as a Chain consisting of several Links; but mine is all one Piece, without any Link or Joints, and takes its Flexibility from the Purenness of the Metal.

I doubt not there are many Gentlemen of the Society, who can give a better Account of the Torques than I can. If, for your own Satisfaction, you have a mind to be further informed of the Use of it among the Antients, you may, I believe, find it in a Treatise written by one John Schefferus, de Antiquorum Torquibus, which is printed in Graevius&#x27;s Collections, but I have not the Book here.

I have not forgot the Oil or Scum which floats on the Sea about Midsummer, and will endeavour to have some saved the next Season.

I am, Sir,

Your most humble Servant,

Tho. Mostyn.

IX. A Letter from Benj. Cooke, F. R. S. to Peter Collinson, F. R. S. giving an Account of the Fire-ball seen Dec. 11. 1741.

Dear Sir,

Newport, in the Isle of Wight, Jan. 25. 1741-2.

I Did not see the Phenomenon (the Fire-ball seen Dec. 11. 1741.) you mention*; but a Gentleman of my Acquaintance was
