II. An Account of the Moon&#x27;s Eclipse, February 2. 1701 observed at Streatham near London, and compared with the Calculation. By the Rev. Mr H. Cressener, M.A. Fellow of the Royal Society.

In the last Lunar Eclipse, on the second of February 1709-10, the time of the end (which was what alone the want of a proper Apparatus and a favourable Skie would give me leave exactly to determine) I found to be the same (with but a very inconsiderable Difference) which the Calculation, according to our most Learned Presidents admirable Theory, promis&#x27;d me to expect.

There being therefore no Examples of any Calculation (that I know of) according to that Theory, nor of the Theory&#x27;s Agreement with Observation yet made Publick; I thought it proper to offer this one to this Learned Society&#x27;s Perusal, that the exact consent with Observation in this, may prompt some of them to try the like in others. I have added the Calculation from the famous Mr. Flamsteed&#x27;s Tables, according to Horrox&#x27;s Theory,
Theory, as I find them publish&#x27;d in the Ingenious Mr. Whiston&#x27;s Astronomical Lectures, with the Radix&#x27;s or the Mean Motions, corrected according to their first Authors later Observations, which are the same with those assum&#x27;d in Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Theory.

By comparing these two Calculations we may observe, that tho&#x27; most of the additional Equations in Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Theory be very small in this Situation of the Moon, yet they all conspire so as to make its Place considerably more agreeable to Observation, than those of Horrox&#x27;s System.

The Observation was made at Streatham, about six Miles near direct South of London, with a very good Eight foot Telescope. To correct the Clock, (for want of an Instrument,) I carried with me next Day two Watches, that were before adjusted to the Clock, and compar&#x27;d them with Mr. Flamsteed&#x27;s at the Royal Observatory, having first noted its Error by an Observation of the Sun&#x27;s Transit of the Meridian his Assistant communicated to me: Upon my return, I found my Watches still to agree together, and to my Clock, which prov&#x27;d them to have gone true, and gave me the exact Error of my Clock, and the true time at Observation.

Mr. Flamsteed has since been pleased to acquaint me, that by his Observation of the Meridional Transit of the Lyons Heart during the Eclipse, his Clock needed a yet further Correction of one Minute, which I have here accounted for.
