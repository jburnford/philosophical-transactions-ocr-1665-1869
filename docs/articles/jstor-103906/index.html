III. A Description of the same Narhual, communicated by John Henry Hampe, M.D. F.R.S.

In a Creek called the Beluhmer Wadt; belonging to the Bailiwick of Newhaus in the Dutchy of Bremen, hath been caught alive, an unknown Fish of a large Size, 18 to 20 Feet in Length, and four in Diameter. He hath on the Fore-part of the Head, just above the Mouth, which is very small, a Horn six Feet long, white like Ivory, and curiously twisted. The Body is white, sprinkled with black Spots, and smooth like an Eel. The Head is in Proportion to the Body, very
very small, about 16 Inches in Length, and the same in Diameter. The Eyes are also small, about the Bigness of a Sixpence. On the upper part of the Head, is a Hole about three Inches in Diameter, out of which probably he spouts Water, like the Whales. On each Side of the Neck are placed two black Finns, one above another, and at a small Distance from one another. They are half an Inch in Thickness, of one Hand&#x27;s Breadth, and two Feet in Length, round on the Fore-part all fleshy, and of a Liver-colour.

INSECTUM aquaticum, cujus iconem trado, Uderwangae in Borussia Orientali inter astacos lacustres repertum, hominibusque astacos venantibus plane ignotum, amicus singularis D. B. tum temporis Uderwangae commorans, pro museo meo conservatum, redux mihi tradidit.

Ob magnum numerum pedum, &amp; mira facilitate mobilium, Scolopendram Aquaticam Scutatam pari, si non meliori, jure, quo Aldrovandus piscem quendam cetaceum, Scolopendram Cetaceam (de Cetis pag. 721.) insignivit, appellare liceat.
