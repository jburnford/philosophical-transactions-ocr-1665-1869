<div class="ocr-text">I. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Christopher Mason, concerning a Fire-ball seen in the Air, and a great Explosion heard, Dec. 11. 1741.

Read at a Meeting of the Royal Society, on January 7. 1741-2.

On the 11th Instant, at Bucksteep in Warbleton Parish, in the County of Sussex, about a Quarter before One o’Clock in the Afternoon, I observed a very dark uncommon Appearance in the North, and at the same time the Sun shone bright at my Back; when, on a sudden, there was an Explosion, as violent as the Report of a Mortar-piece, attended with a rumbling Echo, which run Eastward; and as near as I could conjecture, it came from about 40 Degrees of Elevation.
