<div class="ocr-text">To Mr. H. Baker F. R. S. of extraordinary Heat in Feb. and of the same Earthquake.

Dear Sir,

Read March 8. 1749-50.

THE Temperature of the Air was found to be warmer by my Thermometer (abroad) several Days of the last Month at 2h p.m. than I had observed it to be some Days in June last, at the same Hour; but, on Thursday Feb. 22. at 2h p.m. it stood at near 63; and soon after rose to 63 full; which is higher, as appears from my Register, than it was at the same Time of Day, 18 Days in the Month of June. And I find, by an Account sent me from Mr. Canton, of Spital-Square, that his Thermometer was at the same Degree at 2a p.m. the same Day.

This perhaps may be thought not unworthy to be register&#x27;d in the meteorological Accounts in the Phil. Trans. but is submitted to the Judgment of the Royal Society, by

Your and their most obedient,

H. Miles.

P.S. I was this Morning, at 5h 40&#x27; surprised with a violent Shock in my Study, which shook the Doors of my Book-Presles exceedingly: It was felt all over this Town and the next. I have not Time for further Particulars, nor am I able to say as yet, whether it was caused by the blowing up of a Powder-Mill, or by an Earthquake.
