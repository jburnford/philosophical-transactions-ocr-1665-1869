The noble method pointed out by Galileo, and first attempted by Hook, Flamsteed, Molineux, and Bradley, of taking distances of stars from the zenith that pass very near it, though it failed with regard to parallax, has been productive of the most noble discoveries of another nature, p. 84.

Telescopes. Amazing improvements in the construction of, p. 89. Double start of excellent use in trying them, p. 101. Estimations made with one telescope cannot be applied to those made with another; nor can the estimations made with different powers of magnifying, though with the same telescope, be applied to each other, p. 102.

Thermometer. Account of an improved one, by Mr. James Six, p. 72. Inconvenience attending the thermometers in common use, ibid. Which Van Swinden, Mr. Kraft, Lord Charles Cavendish, Mr. Fitzgerald, &amp;c. have endeavoured to remedy, ibid. Description of Mr. Six&#x27;s, p. 73. Which in some respects resembles those of Mr. Bernouilli and Lord Charles Cavendish; but differs in the essential property of shewing how high the mercury had risen in the observer&#x27;s absence, p. 74. How that difference is effected, ibid. How to rectify this thermometer after an observation, without disturbing the mercury, p. 75. Method of depositing it, without hanging up, and of preventing the mercury shifting its place in the spirits within the tube, p. 76. And of making this thermometer a mercurial one, ibid. Other inconveniencies attending the common thermometers removed by this, p. 77. Mr. Six&#x27;s different methods of constructing his thermometers, p. 78. Method of adjusting the divisions on the scale to the inequalities of the tubes, p. 78. See Nollet, Rain.

An attempt to make one for measuring the higher degrees of heat, from a red heat up to the strongest that vessels made of clay can support, by Mr. Josiah Wedgwood, p. 305. Uses to which a measure for the higher degrees of heat may be applied, p. 306. Inconveniencies arising from the want of it, ibid. See Fire. Manner of constructing the thermometer, p. 308.

Vegetable kingdom. Some farther considerations on the influence of, on the animal creation, by John Ingen-housz, p. 426. Account of several experiments, demonstrating, that vegetables diffuse through our atmosphere, in the sun-shine, a conti-
nual shower of beneficial truly vital air, ibid. p. 433. Observations thereon, p. 433—438. Benefits to be drawn from this new discovery, p. 438.

Vegetation, uncommon. See Hemp Seed.

Velocity of the rays of light. An experiment proposed for determining, by the aberration of the fixed stars, whether the rays of light, in pervading different media, change their velocity according to the laws which result from Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s ideas concerning the cause of refraction, and for ascertaining their velocity in every medium whose respective density is known, p. 58. See Leibnitz, Refraction. Proofs that the aberrations in a telescope filled with a dense fluid will precisely agree with that of Dr. Bradley&#x27;s, only in the case of the rays moving swifter in the medium than in air, in the ratio assigned by Sir Isaac Newton, and that this same effect of aberration will itself be a proof of light being so accelerated within the telescope, p. 60. et seq. Propositions concerning the viewing a subject, when the dense fluid within the telescope is confined by object-glasses of any figure, p. 65. et seq.
