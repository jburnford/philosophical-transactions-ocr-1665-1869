<div class="ocr-text">Martin Clare Esq; F. R. S. to C. Mortimer M. D. &amp; Secr. R. S. of the same.

SIR,

Read March 8.

As I was walking this Morning in my Garden at Kensington Gravel-Pits, about 40 Minutes after 5 by my Watch, I felt an exceeding great Shock, a Succussion of the Earth, attended with an Explosion that, I fancy, resembled the blowing up of a Mine, and with the same kind of Noise. It was follow&#x27;d by a Trembling, very brisk at first, which gradually abated; and in about 3 Seconds, as near as I can judge, totally ceased. The Tremor was attended with the Noise of a distant Thunder, which, with the Motion, gradually died away.

I am not certain the Building near me moved; but I fancied it did. My Feet I am sure felt great Emotion; and a large Watering-pot, of 9 Inches Base, that stood near me, was thrown all along, the Moment the Trembling ceased.

This Communication I thought would be acceptable, from,

SIR,

March 8, 1749-50.

Your obedient humble Servant,

M. Clare.

P.S. I have since discover&#x27;d that my Watering-pot was over-set by a Brick that was thrown off the House by the Shock.</div>
