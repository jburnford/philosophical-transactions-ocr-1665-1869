<div class="ocr-text">VII. Part of a Letter written by Roelof Diodati, Supreme Director of the Council of Mauricius; to Mr. Witlen, Burger-Master of Amsterdam, and F. R. S. Dated August 8, 1697. Concerning an extraordinary Inundation in that Island.

We cannot but give your Worship notice, that on the 22th of March last, at half an Hour after Twelve a Clock, being Calm but a little Rainy Weather, the River which passeth by the plain Ground of Noordwyck, did, in the space of a quarter of an Hour, fwell to that Height, that the Sugar-Mill, the Sugar-Work, and almost all the said Ground was thereby ruin&#x27;d, the most part of the Sugar-Canes being rooted or torn out of the Ground by the Violence of the Torrent. We cannot imagine whence so sudden a Swelling of this River has been caused, while the Rain not being very hard, could not be of that effect, for in such Case it should have continued longer; for about Twelve a Clock, when the Company&#x27;s Servants assembled for their Dinner, the Water of the River was at its ordinary Height, and before they had half dined all the Country was overflowed by the Water, viz. One Foot higher than Two Years ago, by reason of the Hurricane, when we had so violent a Storm as ever was heard of. It is very remarkable, that at One a Clock all the Extraordinary Water was gone, and the River again at his ordinary Height. There has been no Earthquake that could cause it, neither was there any such thing in other Rivers, but only in this passing by the plain Ground of Noordwyck.
