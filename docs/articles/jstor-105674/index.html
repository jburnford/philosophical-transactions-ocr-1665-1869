Minutes of the Observation of the Transit of Venus over the Sun, the 6th of June 1761, taken at Calcutta in Bengal, Latitude $22^\circ 30&#x27;$, Longitude East from London nearly $92^\circ$: communicated from the Court of Directors of the East India Company, by Charles Morton, M.D. F.R.S.

| Event                                      | Time   |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| The appulse uncertain, but very apparent at | $8 \text{ h } 11 \text{ m } 35 \text{ s}$ |
| The center of Venus on the Sun&#x27;s limb      | $8 \text{ h } 16 \text{ m } 35 \text{ s}$ |
| The interior contact at the ingress         | $8 \text{ h } 24 \text{ m } 40 \text{ s}$ |
| Interior contact at the egress              | $2 \text{ h } 15 \text{ m } 55 \text{ s}$ |
| Center of Venus on the Sun&#x27;s limb at the egress | $2 \text{ h } 24 \text{ m } 0 \text{ s}$ |
| Total egress                               | $2 \text{ h } 32 \text{ m } 0 \text{ s}$ |

The above observations were minuted from a stopwatch of Mr. Ellicott&#x27;s, having no pendulum-clock or time-piece.

The weather being cloudy for several days before that of observation, there was no opportunity of ascertaining the error of the watch; but, on the day of observation, I found, upon comparing the watch with a meridian line in the town-hall, that when the center of the Sun&#x27;s image was on the meridian line, the time pointed by the watch was $4&#x27; 10&#x27;&#x27;$ past twelve.

Comparing the watch the 7th, 8th, and 9th June with the meridian line, I found it had gained nearly two minutes each day, the time pointed by the watch on the 9th June being $10&#x27; 5&#x27;&#x27;$, when the Sun was on the meridian.
It took about 5&#x27;&#x27; to wind the watch up every day, which I carefully observed; from the aforegoing remarks I have made the following corrections.

Centre of Venus on the Sun&#x27;s limb at \[8^h\ 12&#x27; 54&#x27;&#x27;\]
ingress \[8^h\ 20&#x27; 58&#x27;&#x27;\]
Interior contact at the ingress \[2^h\ 11&#x27; 34&#x27;&#x27;\]
Centre of Venus on the Sun&#x27;s limb at \[2^h\ 19&#x27; 38&#x27;&#x27;\]
the egress \[2^h\ 27&#x27; 38&#x27;&#x27;\]
Total egress \[6^h\ 22&#x27; 48&#x27;&#x27;\]

And if the same time be allowed for the first semidiameter of the planet coming on as the other three, it must have commenced at \(8^h\ 4&#x27; 50&#x27;&#x27;\), so that the total duration was
