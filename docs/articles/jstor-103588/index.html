<div class="ocr-text">VI. Extract of a Letter from Dr. Deidier, concerning an Experiment made with the Bile of Persons dead of the Plague. Communicated by Dr. Woodward.

We caused two Dogs to swallow a pretty large Quantity of the Bile taken from the Bodies of Persons dead of the Plague.

Upon this the Dogs appeared heavy and melancholy, refused their Food, and made Water very often, especially when they were any ways disturb&#x27;d. Their Urine was thick and very fetid, and their gross Excrements were tinged with the black and greenish Bile, which they had swallow&#x27;d. But in a few Days those Accidents went off, and the Dogs recovered their perfect Health, though they were all the Time confin&#x27;d in a Cellar belonging to the Dispensary, in company with the other Dogs that we tried our Experiments upon.

Montpelier, April 28.
1722.</div>
