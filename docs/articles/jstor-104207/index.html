<div class="ocr-text">VII. Part of a Letter from the Rev&#x27;d Mr. Thomas Lord, to William Folkes, Esq; F. R. S. concerning some Worms whose Parts live after they have been cut asunder.

Read June 9.

After I had, without Success, made several repeated Searches for the Polypus, in several Fishponds, and a small Stream in my Parish, I applied myself to collect the different Insects of various Sorts I had there met with, and which were of more than 30 Kinds, all which I put together; but some of them voraciously seized upon others, and devoured them, so that in a Day&#x27;s time I had hardly any left, but a few of one Sort, which rolled themselves up like Millipedes, or Hog-lice, but were, upon the Whole, more of the Leech Kind, and could extend themselves about an Inch in Length. These I cut asunder, but the Pieces died in about 30 Hours after the Operation. I then recollected, that, in the Account * published by Dr. Mortimer, mention is made of a French Gentleman, that had discovered Water-worms, that would live after cutting: I searched for all I could find fastened either upon rotten Wood, Leaves, Straws, or Stones, that I took out from the Bottom of the Water, and cut of every Sort asunder; but none lived above 48 Hours, except these I here send you. In one Glass are Four Pieces that now seem to be complete Worms, and the same as the Two in the other Phial: These Four Pieces, 12 Days since, were Two Worms: I cut them asunder with my

Thomas Lord.

The Two entire Worms here mentioned to have been contained in one of the Phials sent up by Mr. Lord, were each cut presently after into Two Pieces, which soon after completed themselves, grew longer, and were several Weeks after in a vigorous and thriving Condition.

VIII. A Letter from Dr. Parsons to Martin Folkes, Esq; President of the Royal Society, containing the Natural History of the Rhinoceros.

SIR,

Read June 9. 1743.

Although many Authors have given Accounts and Figures of the Rhinoceros from time to time, and although there was one in England in 1685, yet how far were we from having the least Notion of his Form, when we came to see him in 1739. It was not difficult, even before the Arrival of the latter here, to discern an Uncertainty in the Figures that were exhibited of that Animal, because they differed so widely from each other;</div>
