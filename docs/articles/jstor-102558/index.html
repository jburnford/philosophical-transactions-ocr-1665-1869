<div class="ocr-text">X. A Copy of a Letter from R. P. Vicar of Kildwick in Yorkshire, to a Friend of his in those Parts, wherein he gives an Account of an Extraordinary Eruption of Water, which happened in June, 1686.

Worthy Sir,

I have now drawn a full, though short, Account of the great Loss sustained by the Inhabitants of Kettlewell and Starbotton, in Craven, in the County of York; by a sudden overflow of Water. The Towns are situate under a great Hill on the East and West; the Country is very mountainous and Rocky. The Descent of the Rain was after a Thunder-Clap, for the Continuance of about an Hour and half, with extraordinary Violence, and by several Eye-witnesses, the Rock on the East side opened visibly, and Water they beheld thence into the Air, the height of an ordinary Church-Steeple; so that the Current of Water came down the Hill into the respective Towns, as in one entire Body, and with a Breast as if it would have drowned the whole Towns. Several Houses were quite demolished, and not a Stone left; others gravel&#x27;d to the Chamber-Windows; some Inhabitants driven, until this Day, from their Habitations, the Current of the Water running through their Houses; mighty Rocks descended from the Mountains into the Valley, and there lie immovable; many fair Meadows cover&#x27;d with Sand and Stones, that the Worth of the Soil will not regain the same. Household-goods taken away into the great River of Wharfe, and so
so lost; besides many quick Goods. The loss reputed to be many Thousand Pounds. Many Families quite ruined; others in part only. Such an Instance hath not been heard of within Memory, considering all Circumstances. Much more might be said; but, in short, this may satisfy as an intelligible Account of what you requested from,

TO OUR FRIEND,

R. P.

Since the first Flood that I have related, there have been Two others, though not so great and dangerous: For the Towns have either of them a great Beck (as we call it) or Current of Water running through them, which by the first Flood were gravel&#x27;d up; so that the Passage is much altered, and cannot be regained; though there have been many Hundreds of Men set to do it, and Hundreds of a Day.</div>
