<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">From these Histories it appears, that the Child before its Birth ought to be consider&#x27;d as a separate, as a distinct Organisation; and that, though wholly nourish&#x27;d by its Mother&#x27;s Fluids, with regard to the Small Pox, it is liable to be affected in a very different Manner, and at a very different Time, from its Mother.

X. The Case of Nicolas Reeks, who was born with his Feet turned inwards, which came to rights after being some time used to sit cross-legged. Transmitted from Wm. Milner, Esq; at Poole, to Sir Peter Thompson, Knt. F. R. S.

Read Dec. Nicolas Reeks was born in the Town of Poole, 1724, with both his Feet turn&#x27;d inwards. His Mother carried him to a Surgeon, who upon Examination gave it as his Opinion that he was incurable. The Boy, as he grew up, was with great Difficulty able to walk, but always on the outward Edge of his Feet and Heels, so that he frequently fell down in walking, one Foot striking against the other.

His Parents being poor, in 1735, the Parish put him Apprentice to Mr. Richard Mocket, of the same Town, Taylor, apprehending it the only Trade he could be fit for as a Cripple. His Shocs were made in a peculiar manner to lace on to his Legs, the Muscles
Muscles of which were much smaller than those of Boys of his Age. He lived with his Master, and worked at the Trade, till about 1741, when they began to perceive a manifest Alteration and Turn in both of his Feet; which was brought on without the Assistance of any manner of Art, Application of Plaisters, Oils, or Bandages, till both Feet were turned to their right and natural Situation. He was able to wear his Master&#x27;s Shoes, the Muscles of his Legs grew larger, his Feet and Legs like other People&#x27;s of his Age; if any Difference, they turned outwards more than others do. In March 1743 he ran away from his Master, entered on board a Ship of War as a Marine, and is now living at Portsmouth.

Nov. 1. 1749.

&#x27;I Richard Mockett, having read over the foregoing Case, do hereby certify, that Nicolas Reeks was a Cripple, as therein described, when I took him an Apprentice; and that he was cured, whilst he lived with me, without any Advice, Assistance, or Application of Medicine, or Bandage whatever: And I am of Opinion the Cure was performed by his sitting crois-legg&#x27;d on the Shop-board; as witness my Hand, in Poole, 1st Nov. 1749.

&#x27;Richd. Mockett.&#x27;

&#x27;We whose Names are hereunto subscribed, do well remember, that Nicolas Reeks, mentioned in the foregoing Certificate, and formerly apprenticed to Mr. Richard Mockett, was born hurl-footed in both Feet, and a Cripple; and do know, that he was
was cured, and well able to walk, before he left his said Master; and do believe it was performed without any Art or Assistance whatever, than as express&#x27;d above; as witness our Hands,

Mabella Glover.

Susannah Jasper, the Boy&#x27;s own Aunt.

The foregoing Account of the Cripple Nicolas Reeks was drawn up in such Terms as were most agreeable to the Apprehensions of the Persons who have certified the Truth of the Fact, and to whom it was first read: And I am well satisfied in the Credibility of their Testimony, and that many other Persons of Reputation might be called on, who would sign the same.

Nov. 11. 1749.

XI. A Letter from Mr. James Short, F.R.S. to the President, with the Description and Uses of an Equatorial Telescope.

SIR,

Read, Dec. 7. 1749.

I send you along with this the Description and Uses of the Equatorial Telescope, as also a Drawing of it; which you desired of me some time since, in order that it might be laid before the Society. I have made three of these Instruments, one of which was bought by Count Bentink for</div>
