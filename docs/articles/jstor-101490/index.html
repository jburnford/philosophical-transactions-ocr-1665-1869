Fourthly, that he can assure of an honest Blacksmith, who by his healing hand converted his Bars of Iron into Plates of Silver; and had this particular faculty, that he caused Vomitings by stroaking the Stomack; gave the Stool by stroaking the Belly; appeased the Gout, and other pains, by stroaking the parts affected.

Some particulars, communicated from foreign parts, concerning the Permanent Spott in Jupiter; and a Contest between two Artists about Optick Glasses, &amp;c.

Eustachio de Divinis (saith the Informer,) has written a large Letter, wherein he pretends, that the Permanent Spot in Jupiter hath been first of all discovered with his Glasses; and that the P. Gotignies is the first that hath thence deduced the Motion of Jupiter about his Axis; and that Signior Cassini opposed it at first; to whom the said Gotignies wrote a letter of complaint thereupon.

The same Eustachio pretends likewise, that his great Glasses excell those of Campani; and that in all the tryals, made with them, they have performed better; and that Campani was not willing to do, what was necessary for well comparing the one with the other. viz. To put equall Eyeglasses in them, or to exchange the same Glasses.

The said Divini affirms also, that he hath found a way to know

In the First Section, of the different Method, to be employed in the cure of Fevers, not only in respect of the differing constitutions and ages of the patients, but also in regard of the differing seasons of one and the same year, and of the difference of one year from another. As to the Former, he shews, in what sorts of Patients, and at what time of the Fever, Phlebotomy, or Vomiting, or both, are to be used; and when and where not: In what space of time the Depuration if nature be not disturbed or hindered in her work, will be perform&#x27;d: When Purgatives are to be administred: How that Diarrhea&#x27;s happen, if the Patient had in the beginning</div>
