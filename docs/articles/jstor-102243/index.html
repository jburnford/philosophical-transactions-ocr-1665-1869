<div class="ocr-text">beauty of the thing: Indeed, if I was never to come near
er a building, and to view it always at such a distance, this
might be excused as to me; and so in Artificial things, as
in Pictures and Carvings to be seen on high: but yet, in
my opinion, &#x27;tis but an excuse of laziness to tell me such
and such rude dashes will have a marvelous effect at a dis-
tance; as though things Painted or Carved to adorn our
comparatively low Roomes were distanced: And this No-
ble Art, in my opinion, has of late in nothing suffered
so much with us, as in admitting of this vile excuse; where-
as indeed, what is well done, and most exactly finished in
the most minute parts of a thing Painted, I am sure if it
please me near the eye, it will never displease me at a
distance.

2. Some probable thoughts of the Whiteness of the Chyle, and what it is after it
is conveyed within the Arteries. By the Learned Martin Lister Esq;

1. In the digestion of meat in the stomach, there is
made a separation or solution of Urinous Salts; no
otherwise than in the rotting of Plants or Animals.
2. The Chyle is highly impregnated with this Urinous Salt.
3. The Whiteness of the Chyle is from the Fermentation it
has from its mixture with Urinous Salts, and that if
diluted with fair water, it is wholly deprived of that
colour, the Fermentation ceasing.
4. The Salt Chyle is conveyed into the Venal blood, and
with it enters the heart; and it is thence thrown out
again Chyle, as it comes in, by a continual pulsation,
into the Arteries.

5. That
5. That as oft as it enters the Emulgent Arteries, it there leaves behind it part of its Salinous liquor or Urine, and consequently abates of its colour.

6. That when sufficiently freed of its Urinous Salt, it becomes a Lymphas, which we think nothing else, but the residue of the Chyle, not yet made into the nature of blood, as not sufficiently separated of its saline particles.

7. That probably it circulates long under the nature of a Lymphas, often visiting all the parts of the body by the Arteries, and returning again to the Heart, partly by its own vessels, and partly by the veins.

8. That in defect of Chyle (for we cannot constantly feed) nature continually supplies the mass of blood with the Lymphas, or old Chyle.

9. That upon every supply of fresh Chyle, much of the old stock, or Lymphas is (according to the necessity of parts) converted into this or that use, and not till then.

10. That there is ever more Lymphas in the mass of blood, than there is need of for the diluting of it. The arterial blood (be the animal never so much exhausted by hunger) alwaies parting with some, upon extravasation and coagulation.

11. In the coagulation of extravasated blood, there is no precipitation of parts, as in curdled Milk, &amp;c., for if the Chyle be freshly distributed into the mass of blood, it will again separate itself, as it will from water; and in like manner it is with the Lymphas or old Chyle, neither of them being as yet any essential part of the blood.

12. The venal and arterial blood have probably both a like quantity of Lymphas to dilute them; but the arterial in coagulating involves within its crassamentum more than the venal: the reason may be, for that the arterial is fuller of air, which rarifies and renders the arterial crassamentum more porous, and capacious of lodging the Lymphas, which yet as it subsides by long standing, parts
parts with more and more Lymph daily.

13. The great instrument of the circulation of the blood is the Systole, or vibration of the heart, which yet would not be sufficient from hindring the coagulation of the blood, without a continual supply of Lymph to dilute it.

An Exact Account of the Three late Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter, (within the space or less than seven months according to accurate Observations) viz. Octob. 14.82, &amp;c. Together with an Account of what other Conjunctions of them there happened for more than 100 years last; beginning at the year 1563: And a Table Computed whereby to make an Estimate of what other Conjunctions have happened for the time past, or that will happen for the time to come. All by J. F. Astron. Reg. &amp; R. S. S.

Whilst the Common People have admired to see the two Superior Planets Saturn and Jupiter continue so near each other the whole year, and our Astrologers have affrighted them with fearful Predictions of direful events to succeed this appearance, the more</div>
