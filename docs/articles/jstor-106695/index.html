Read June 11, 1789.

By the continuation of a review of the heavens with my twenty-feet reflector, I am now furnished with a second thousand of new Nebulae.

These curious objects, not only on account of their number, but also in consideration of their great consequence, as being no less than whole sidereal systems, we may hope, will in future engage the attention of Astronomers. With a view to induce them to undertake the necessary observations, I offer them the following catalogue, which, like my former one, of which it is a continuation, contains a short description of each nebula or cluster of stars, as well as its situation with respect to some known object.

The form of this work, it will be seen, is exactly that of the former part, the classes and numbers being continued, and the same letters used to express, in the shortest way, as many essential features of the objects as could possibly be crowded into so small a compass as that to which I thought it expedient to limit myself.

The method I have taken of analyzing the heavens, if I may so express myself, is perhaps the only one by which we can arrive
arrive at a knowledge of their construction. In the prosecution of so extensive an undertaking, it may well be supposed that many things must have been suggested, by the great variety in the order, the size, and the compression of the stars, as they presented themselves to my view, which it will not be improper to communicate.

To begin our investigation according to some order, let us depart from the objects immediately around us to the most remote that our telescopes, of the greatest power to penetrate into space, can reach. We shall touch but slightly on things that have already been remarked.

From the earth, considered as a planet, and the moon as its satellite, we pass through the region of the rest of the planets, and their satellites. The similarity between all these bodies is sufficiently striking to allow us to comprehend them under one general definition, of bodies not luminous in themselves, revolving round the sun. The great diminution of light, when reflected from such bodies, especially when they are also at a great distance from the light which illuminates them, precludes all possibility of following them a great way into space. But if we did not know that light diminishes as the squares of the distances increase, and that moreover in every reflection a very considerable part is entirely lost, the motion of comets, whereby the space through which they run is measured out to us, while on their return from the sun we see them gradually disappear as they advance towards their aphelia, would be sufficient to convince us that bodies shining only with borrowed light can never be seen at any very great distance. This consideration brings us back to the sun, as a resplendent fountain of light, whilst it establishes at the same time beyond a doubt that every star must likewise be a sun,

shining by its own native brightness. Here then we come to the more capital parts of the great construction.

These suns, every one of which is probably of as much consequence to a system of planets, satellites, and comets, as our own sun, are now to be considered, in their turn, as the minute parts of a proportionally greater whole. I need not repeat that by my analysis it appears, that the heavens consist of regions where suns are gathered into separate systems, and that the catalogues I have given comprehend a list of such systems; but may we not hope that our knowledge will not stop short at the bare enumeration of phenomena capable of giving us so much instruction? Why should we be less inquisitive than the natural philosopher, who sometimes, even from an inconsiderable number of specimens of a plant, or an animal, is enabled to present us with the history of its rise, progress, and decay? Let us then compare together, and clas some of these numerous sidereal groups, that we may trace the operations of natural causes as far as we can perceive their agency. The most simple form, in which we can view a sidereal system, is that of being globular. This also, very favourably to our design, is that which has presented itself most frequently, and of which I have given the greatest collection.

But, first of all, it will be necessary to explain what is our idea of a cluster of stars, and by what means we have obtained it. For an instance, I shall take the phenomenon which presents itself in many clusters: It is that of a number of lucid spots, of equal lustre, scattered over a circular space, in such a manner as to appear gradually more compressed towards the middle; and which compression, in the clusters to which I allude, is generally carried so far, as, by imperceptible degrees,
to end in a luminous center, of a resolvable blaze of light. To solve this appearance, it may be conjectured, that stars of any given, very unequal magnitudes, may easily be so arranged, in scattered, much extended, irregular rows, as to produce the above described picture; or, that stars, scattered about almost promiscuously within the frustum of a given cone, may be assigned of such properly diversified magnitudes as also to form the same picture. But who, that is acquainted with the doctrine of chances, can seriously maintain such improbable conjectures? To consider this only in a very coarse way, let us suppose a cluster to consist of 5000 stars, and that each of them may be put into one of 5000 given places, and have one of 5000 assigned magnitudes. Then, without extending our calculation any further, we have five and twenty millions of chances, out of which only one will answer the above improbable conjecture, while all the rest are against it. When we now remark that this relates only to the given places within the frustum of a supposed cone, whereas these stars might have been scattered all over the visible space of the heavens; that they might have been scattered, even within the supposed cone, in a million of places different from the assumed ones, the chance of this apparent cluster&#x27;s not being a real one, will be rendered so highly improbable that it ought to be entirely rejected.

Mr. Michell computes, with respect to the six brightest stars of the Pleiades only, that the odds are near 500000 to 1 that no six stars, out of the number of those which are equal in splendour to the faintest of them, scattered at random in the whole heavens, would be within so small a distance from each other as the Pleiades are *.

* Phil. Trans. vol. LVII, p. 246.
Taking it then for granted that the stars which appear to be gathered together in a group are in reality thus accumulated, I proceed to prove also that they are nearly of an equal magnitude.

The cluster itself, on account of the small angle it subtends to the eye, we must suppose to be very far removed from us. For, were the stars which compose it at the same distance from one another as Sirius is from the sun; and supposing the cluster to be seen under an angle of 10 minutes, and to contain 50 stars in one of its diameters, we should have the mean distance of such stars twelve seconds; and therefore the distance of the cluster from us about seventeen thousand times greater than the distance of Sirius. Now, since the apparent magnitude of these stars is equal, and their distance from us is also equal,—because we may safely neglect the diameter of the cluster, which, if the center be seventeen thousand times the distance of Sirius from us, will give us seventeen thousand and twenty-five for the farthest, and seventeen thousand wanting twenty-five for the nearest star of the cluster;—it follows that we must either give up the idea of a cluster, and recur to the above refuted supposition, or admit the equality of the stars that compose these clusters. It is to be remarked that we do not mean entirely to exclude all variety of size; for the very great distance, and the consequent smallness of the component clustering stars, will not permit us to be extremely precise in the estimation of their magnitudes; though we have certainly seen enough of them to know that they are contained within pretty narrow limits; and do not, perhaps, exceed each other in magnitude more than in some such proportion as one full-grown plant of a certain species may exceed another full-grown plant of the same species.
If we have drawn proper conclusions relating to the size of stars, we may with still greater safety speak of their relative situations, and affirm that in the same distances from the center an equal scattering takes place. If this were not the case, the appearance of a cluster could not be uniformly increasing in brightness towards the middle, but would appear nebulous in those parts which were more crowded with stars; but, as far as we can distinguish, in the clusters of which we speak, every concentric circle maintains an equal degree of compression, as long as the stars are visible; and when they become too crowded to be distinguished, an equal brightness takes place, at equal distances from the center, which is the most luminous part.

The next step in my argument will be to shew that these clusters are of a globular form. This again we rest on the sound doctrine of chances. Here, by way of strength to our argument, we may be allowed to take in all round nebulæ, though the reasons we have for believing that they consist of stars have not as yet been entered into. For, what I have to say concerning their spherical figure will equally hold good whether they be groups of stars or not. In my catalogues we have, I suppose, not less than one thousand of these round objects. Now, whatever may be the shape of a group of stars, or of a Nebula, which we would introduce instead of the spherical one, such as a cone, an ellipsis, a spheroid, a circle or a cylinder, it will be evident that out of a thousand situations, which the axes of such forms may have, there is but one that can answer the phenomenon for which we want to account; and that is, when those axes are exactly in a line drawn from the object to the place of the observer. Here again we have a million of chances of which all but one are against any other
hypothesis than that which we maintain, and which, for this reason, ought to be admitted.

The last thing to be inferred from the above related appearances is, that these clusters of stars are more condensed towards the center than at the surface. If there should be a group of stars in a spherical form, consisting of such as were equally scattered over all the assigned space, it would not appear to be very gradually more compressed and brighter in the middle; much less would it seem to have a bright nucleus in the center. A spherical cluster of an equal compression within,—for that such there are will be seen hereafter,—may be distinguished by the degrees of brightness which take place in going from the center to the circumference. Thus, when $a$ is the brightness in the center, it will be $\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}$ at any other distance $x$ from the center. Or, putting $a = 1$, and $x =$ any decimal fraction; then, in a table of natural sines, where $x$ is the sine, the brightness at $x$ will be expressed by the cosine. Now, as a gradual increase of brightness does not agree with the degrees calculated from a supposition of an equal scattering, and as the cluster has been proved to be spherical, it must needs be admitted that there is indeed a greater accumulation towards the center. And thus, from the above-mentioned appearances, we come to know that there are globular clusters of stars nearly equal in size, which are scattered evenly at equal distances from the middle, but with an increasing accumulation towards the center.

We may now venture to raise a superstructure upon the arguments that have been drawn from the appearance of clusters of stars and nebulæ of the form I have been examining, which is that of which I have made mention in my &quot;Theoreti-
&quot;cal view—Formation of Nebulae—Form I*.&quot; It is to be remarked that when I wrote the paragraph I refer to, I delineated nature as well as I do now; but, as I there gave only a general sketch, without referring to particular cases, what I then delivered may have been looked upon as little better than hypothetical reasoning, whereas in the present instance this objection is entirely removed, since actual and particular facts are brought to vouch for the truth of every inference.

Having then established that the clusters of stars of the 1st Form, and round nebulae, are of a spherical figure, I think myself plainly authorized to conclude that they are thus formed by the action of central powers. To manifest the validity of this inference, the figure of the earth may be given as an instance; whose rotundity, setting aside small deviations, the causes of which are well known, is without hesitation allowed to be a phenomenon decisively establishing a centripetal force. Nor do we stand in need of the revolving satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus, to assure us that the same powers are likewise lodged in the masses of these planets. Their globular figure alone must be admitted as a sufficient argument to render this point uncontrovertible. We also apply this inference with equal propriety to the body of the sun, as well as to that of Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon; as owing their spherical shape to the same cause. And how can we avoid inferring, that the construction of the clusters of stars, and nebulae likewise, of which we have been speaking, is as evidently owing to central powers?

Besides, the step that I here make in my inference is in fact a very easy one, and such as ought freely to be granted. Have I not already shewn that these clusters cannot have come to

* Phil. Trans. vol. LXXV, p. 214.
their present formation by any random scattering of stars? The doctrine of chance, by exposing the very great odds against such hypotheses, may be said to demonstrate that the stars are thus assembled by some power or other. Then, what do I attempt more than merely to lead the mind to the conditions under which this power is seen to act?

In a case of such consequence I may be permitted to be a little more diffuse, and draw additional arguments from the internal construction of spherical clusters and nebulae. If we find that there is not only a general form, which, as has been proved, is a sufficient manifestation of a centripetal force, what shall we say when the accumulated condensation, which everywhere follows a direction towards a center, is even visible to the very eye? Were we not already acquainted with attraction, this gradual condensation would point out a central power, by the remarkable disposition of the stars tending towards a center. In consequence of this visible accumulation, whether it may be owing to attraction only, or whether other powers may assist in the formation, we ought not hesitate to ascribe the effect to such as are central; no phenomena being more decisive in that particular, than those of which I am treating.

I am fully aware of the consequences I shall draw upon myself in but mentioning other powers that might contribute to the formation of clusters. A mere hint of this kind, it will be expected, ought not to be given without sufficient foundation; but let it suffice at present to remark that my arguments cannot be affected by my terms: whether I am right to use the plural number,—central powers,—or whether I ought only to say,—the known central force of gravity,—my conclusions will be equally valid. I will however add, that the idea of other cen-
central powers being concerned in the construction of the sidereal heavens, is not one that has only lately occurred to me. Long ago I have entertained a certain theory of diversified central powers of attractions and repulsions; an exposition of which I have even delivered in the years 1780, and 1781, to the Philosophical Society then existing at Bath, in several mathematical papers upon that subject. I shall, however, set aside an explanation of this theory, which would not only exceed the intended limits of this paper, but is moreover not required for what remains at present to be added, and therefore may be given some other time, when I can enter more fully into the subject of the interior construction of sidereal systems.

To return, then, to the case immediately under our present consideration, it will be sufficient that I have abundantly proved that the formation of round clusters of stars and nebulae is either owing to central powers, or at least to one such force as refers to a center.

I shall now extend the weight of my argument, by taking in like wise every cluster of stars or nebula that shews a gradual condensation, or increasing brightness, towards a center or certain point; whether the outward shape of such clusters or nebulae be round, extended; or of any other given form. What has been said with regard to the doctrine of chance, will of course apply to every cluster, and more especially to the extended and irregular shaped ones, on account of their greater size: It is among these that we find the largest assemblages of stars, and most diffusive nebulosities; and therefore the odds against such assemblages happening without some particular power to gather them, increase exceedingly with the number of the stars that are taken together. But if the gradual accumulation either of stars or increasing brightness has before
been admitted as a direction to the seat of power, the same effect will equally point out the same cause in the cases now under consideration. There are besides some additional circumstances in the appearance of extended clusters and nebulæ, that very much favour the idea of a power lodged in the brightest part. Although the form of them be not globular, it is plainly to be seen that there is a tendency towards sphericity, by the swell of the dimensions the nearer we draw towards the most luminous place, denoting as it were a course, or tide of stars, setting towards a center. And—if allegorical expressions may be allowed—it should seem as if the stars thus flocking towards the seat of power were stemmed by the crowd of those already assembled, and that while some of them are successful in forcing their predecessors sideways out of their places, others are themselves obliged to take up with lateral situations, while all of them seem equally to strive for a place in the central swelling, and generating spherical figure.

Since then almost all the nebulæ and clusters of stars I have seen, the number of which is not less than three and twenty hundred, are more condensed and brighter in the middle; and since, from every form, it is now equally apparent that the central accumulation or brightness must be the result of central powers, we may venture to affirm that this theory is no longer an unfounded hypothesis, but is fully established on grounds which cannot be overturned.

Let us endeavour to make some use of this important view of the constructing cause, which can thus model sidereal systems. Perhaps, by placing before us the very extensive and varied collection of clusters, and nebulæ furnished by my catalogues, we may be able to trace the progress of its operation, in the great laboratory of the Universe.
If these clusters and nebulæ were all of the same shape, and had the same gradual condensation, we should make but little progress in this inquiry; but, as we find so great a variety in their appearances, we shall be much sooner at a loss how to account for such various phenomena, than be in want of materials upon which to exercise our inquisitive endeavours.

Some of these round clusters consist of stars of a certain magnitude, and given degree of compression, while the whole cluster itself takes up a space of perhaps 10 minutes; others appear to be made up of stars that are much smaller, and much more compressed, when at the same time the cluster itself subtends a much smaller angle, such as 5 minutes. This diminution of the apparent size, and compression of stars, as well as diameter of the cluster to 4, 3, 2 minutes, may very consistently be ascribed to the different distances of these clusters from the place in which we observe them; in all which cases we may admit a general equality of the sizes, and compression of the stars that compose them, to take place. It is also highly probable that a continuation of such decreasing magnitudes, and increasing compression, will justly account for the appearance of round, easily resolvable, nebulæ; where there is almost a certainty of their being clusters of stars. And no Astronomer can hesitate to go still farther, and extend his surmises by imperceptible steps to other nebulæ, that still preserve the same characteristics, with the only variations of vanishing brightness, and reduction of size.

Other clusters there are that, when they come to be compared with some of the former, seem to contain stars of an equal magnitude, while their compression appears to be considerably different. Here the supposition of their being at different distances will either not explain the apparently greater
compression, or, if admitted to do this, will convey to us a very instructive consequence: which is, that the stars which are thus supposed not to be more compressed than those in the former cluster, but only to appear so on account of their greater distance, must needs be proportionally larger, since they do not appear of less magnitude than the former. As therefore, one or other of these hypotheses must be true, it is not all improbable but that, in some instances, the stars may be more compressed; and in others, of a greater magnitude. This variety of size, in different spherical clusters, I am however inclined to believe, may not go farther than the difference in size, found among the individuals belonging to the same species of plants, or animals, in their different states of age, or vegetation, after they are come to a certain degree of growth. A farther inquiry into the circumstance of the extent, both of condensation and variety of size, that may take place with the stars of different clusters, we shall postpone till other things have been previously discussed.

Let us then continue to turn our view to the power which is moulding the different assortments of stars into spherical clusters. Any force, that acts uninterruptedly, must produce effects proportional to the time of its action. Now, as it has been shewn that the spherical figure of a cluster of stars is owing to central powers, it follows that those clusters which, ceteris paribus, are the most compleat in this figure, must have been the longest exposed to the action of these causes. This will admit of various points of views. Suppose for instance that 5000 stars had been once in a certain scattered situation, and that other 5000 equal stars had been in the same situation, then that of the two clusters which had been longest exposed to the action of the modelling power, we suppose, would
would be most condensed, and more advanced to the maturity of its figure. An obvious consequence that may be drawn from this consideration is, that we are enabled to judge of the relative age, maturity, or climax of a sidereal system, from the disposition of its component parts; and, making the degrees of brightness in nebulae stand for the different accumulation of stars in clusters, the same conclusions will extend equally to them all. But we are not to conclude from what has been said that every spherical cluster is of an equal standing in regard to absolute duration, since one that is composed of a thousand stars only, must certainly arrive to the perfection of its form sooner than another, which takes in a range of a million. Youth and age are comparative expressions; and an oak of a certain age may be called very young, while a contemporary shrub is already on the verge of its decay. The method of judging with some assurance of the condition of any sidereal system may perhaps not improperly be drawn from the standard laid down page 218; so that, for instance, a cluster or nebula which is very gradually more compressed and bright towards the middle, may be in the perfection of its growth, when another which approaches to the condition pointed out by a more equal compression, such as the nebulae I have called Planetary seem to present us with, may be looked upon as very aged, and drawing on towards a period of change, or dissolution. This has been before surmised, when, in a former paper, I considered the uncommon degree of compression that must prevail in a nebula to give it a planetary aspect; but the argument, which is now drawn from the powers that have collected the formerly scattered stars to the form we find they have assumed, must greatly corroborate that sentiment.
This method of viewing the heavens seems to throw them into a new kind of light. They now are seen to resemble a luxuriant garden, which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds; and one advantage we may at least reap from it is, that we can, as it were, extend the range of our experience to an immense duration. For, to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom, is it not almost the same thing, whether we live successively to witness the germination, blooming, foliage, fecundity, fading, withering, and corruption of a plant, or whether a vast number of specimens, selected from every stage through which the plant passes in the course of its existence, be brought at once to our view?

Notes
Notes to some nebulae and clusters of stars.

I. 138. The number refers to De la Caille&#x27;s southern catalogue in the Cœlum Australe Stelliferum.

I. 190. A star of the sixth magnitude, not contained in any catalogue. I have called it C Canum Venaticorum. It follows Fl. 17. Can. Ven. 37° 34′ in time, and is 0° 2′ more south than that star.

II. 566. See the note to I. 138.
638. See the note to I. 138.
697. See the note to I. 190.
703. A star of the 7th magnitude, not contained in any catalogue. I called it A Ceti. Not having settled its place, I can only give it in a coarse way. RA. about 0 h. 31° 37′, PD. about 94° 22′.

III. 678. A star of the 7th magnitude, not contained in any catalogue. I have called it A Bootis. It follows Fl. 39 Bootis 6° 56′ in time, and is 0° 55′ more north.

681. See the note to I. 190.
742. A star of the 7th magnitude, not contained in any catalogue. I have called it B Draconis. Its place very coarsely is RA. 18 h. 47′. PD. 41° 4′.

747. See Mr. Wollaston&#x27;s general catalogue. Zone 20°.

VIII. 49. A star of the 6th magnitude, not contained in any catalogue. I have called it B Geminorum. Not having settled its place, I can only give it in a coarse way, RA. about 6 h. 52′ 4″. PD. about 55° 17′.

P. S. The planet Saturn has a sixth satellite revolving round it in about 32 hours, 48 minutes. Its orbit lies exactly in the plane of the Ring, and within that of the first satellite. An account of its discovery with the forty-feet reflector, and a more accurate determination of its revolution and distance from the planet will be presented to the Royal Society at their next Meetings.
