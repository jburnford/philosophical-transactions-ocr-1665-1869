<div class="ocr-text">him, and that those that came after him and the Romans have much improved those first Inventions; this Author, unwilling to subject his Auditors altogether to the precepts of that ancient Writer, hath chosen among the Moderns those three Architects, that have the most universal approbation, to deliver their thoughts upon each of those Orders, and to give us the easiest means to put them in practice; for which end he hath not scrupled to make several alterations in their method.

In the Second he intends to be much larger, and fully to explain what hath but been touched in this First part, and to compare the Sentiments which Architects have entertained amongst themselves, concerning the best Examples of the Ancients. And &#x27;tis hoped, he will hasten so desirable a work, as much as the nature of it will bear.

II. Remarks upon Two late Ingenious Treatises; the one, an Essay touching the Gravitation and Non-Gravitation of Fluid Bodies; the other, Observations touching the Torricellian Experiment, so far forth as they may concern any Passages in the Enchiridium Metaphysicum: By Dr. Henry More. Printed in London, for Walter Kettilby, 1676. in octavo.

We shall, instead of giving an account of this Tract, desire the Reader to compare with it what hath been not long since publish&#x27;d by those two eminent Philosophers, Mr. Boyle, and Dr. Wallis; the former, in an Hydrostatical Discourse, occasion&#x27;d by the Objections of this Learn&#x27;d Author against some Explications of New Experiments made by the said Mr. Boyle; which was printed at London for Richard Davis, 1672. amongst some other Tracts, viz. New Experiments touching the Relation betwixt Flame and Air; of the Positive or Relative Levity of Bodies under Water; of the Air&#x27;s Spring on Bodies under water, &amp;c. The latter, in a Discourse of Gravity and Gravitation, grounded on Experimental Observations, presented to the R. Society; printed for John Martyn, &amp;c. 1675. These pieces being well laid together, and the doctrine of Hydrostaticks well understood and applied, will make it easy to the Judicious and considerate Reader, what to judge of the whole controversie here treated of.
