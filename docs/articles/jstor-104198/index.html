<div class="ocr-text">V. Part of a Letter from Mr. Macky, Professor of History, to Mr. Mac Laurin, Professor of Mathematics in the University of Edinburgh, and by him communicated to the President of the Royal Society; being an Extract from the Books of the Town-Council of Edinburgh, relating to a Disease there, supposed to be Venereal, in the Year 1497.

Read March 17, 1742-3.

If the Venereal Disease was never known in Europe till the Siege of Naples 1495, it must have made a very quick Progress through Europe in a short time; for in 1497, I find it raging in Edinburgh, and our King and his Council terribly alarmed at this contagious Distemper, as appears from a Proclamation of King James the IVth, in the Records of the Town-Council of Edinburgh. The Minute of Council is dated the 22d of September. I have taken a Copy of it for your Amusement, and, if you please, you may communicate it to the Society. I have pretty nearly observed the old Spelling, except in Numbers.

&quot;22. Septr. 1497.

&quot;It is our Soverane Lords Will and the Command of the Lordis of his Counsale send to the Provest and Baillies within this burt that this Proclamation followand be put till execution for the eschewing of the greit appearand danger of the Infection of his Leiges fra this contagious sickness callit the
