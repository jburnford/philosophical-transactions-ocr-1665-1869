<div class="ocr-text">1. Part of two Letters from Mr Edward Lhwyd, Keeper of the Ashmolean Repository in Oxford, to Mr Samuel Dale of Braintree in Essex, concerning Fossils.

Oxford, Sept. 19. 1701.

The state of these Bodies is quite different in your parts from what it is in Wales and Ireland. In those Countries the Shells are generally Crystalline, but with you (and sometimes hereabouts) they are testaceous: Which difference is doubtless to be attributed to the Soil, and particularly to your Chalk and Flint, which all those Countries want, excepting a small part (I know not by what chance of Diluvian Dissolution) got into the North part of Ireland. But there &#x27;tis remarkable that their Chalk is absolutely petrify&#x27;d: I mean, whereas the Flints are here imbodyed in Chalk, they are there in a Chalk-white Lime-stone. And as your Chalky Countries only afford those Echinitae I have stil&#x27;d, Pileatus, Galeatus, and Cordatus: So I could never find them in all my Travels but at that place; from whence in the time of Paganism the Druids procur&#x27;d them, and sold them amongst our Northern Britains for Stones of Miraculous efficacy against perils by Fire and Water; persuading the Vulgar they were generated in Cocks-knees; as Thousands in the High-Lands believe at this day. And one Fellow had the Impudence to tell me (finding me a little hard of belief) that he himself had taken one (that his Master had shew&#x27;d me) out of a Cocks knee with his own hand.
Oxford, Nov. 10. 1701.

We were surpriz&#x27;d here, to find so many Fossils, scarce distinguishable from Sea Shells: for, as I mention&#x27;d before to you, the case is otherwise in those places I searched. We have indeed in these Parts one or two Fossil Shells of a Testaceous substance; but in colour they recede farther from those of the Sea than yours. I find by those sent me, that you sometimes find them imbedded in solid Stone: Which takes off any objection some might offer, of their being an accidental scattering of Gulls, Crows, &amp;c. on the Harwich Cliffs.

Looking upon this occasion into Cambden&#x27;s Britannia, I find in the last Edition a Note concerning a Petrifying Spring at Harwich, which reduces Clay and Wood into Stone, of which I should be glad of some particular account from you at your leisure: as also of the place where these are found, particularly how far the furthest from the Sea.</div>
