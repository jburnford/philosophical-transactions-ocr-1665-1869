<div class="ocr-text">It may not be improper here to take notice, that as the Measures of the Dwarf were said to be taken with his Cloaths on, these of the Child were also taken over his Cloaths; and they (being a tight Stay and Petticoat) probably sit closer to his Body, and therefore make less Difference in the measuring round his Waist (the only Dimension wherein it could have any Effect) than the looser Coat or Waistcoat of the Dwarf.

XI. Part of a Letter from Robert More Esq; to Mr. W. Watson F. R. S. concerning the Method of gathering Manna near Naples.

Read June 21, 1750.

At Arienzzo, a Town between Naples and Benevento, I found an Ash Coppice, of 8 or 10 Years Growth, from which they collect Manna. It seemed to have been tapped two Years for that Purpose; the Branches had been barked each Year about an Inch broad, and two Feet high; but they told me this was done by an Inch at a time.

They place a Cup at the Bottom of the Wound, which they empty every five Days. This Liquor becomes Manna. They formerly let it dry upon the Tree; but the present way keeps it cleaner. The Manna begins to run (they say in the Scripture Style to rain) the Beginning of August; and if the Season proves dry, they gather it 5 or 6 Weeks. The King of Naples has so large a Revenue from it, that he is extremely jealous of it, during the Season guards
guards the Woods by Shirri, who even fire upon People that come into them, and he makes the stealing of the Liquor Death. The Season in which I was at Arienzzo prevented my seeing the Species of Ash. I believe it to be what our Gardeners call the flowering Ash; the Complexion of the Bark and Bud agrees with one of them I have in my Garden at Lindley. The Man who shew&#x27;d me the Wood, told me, it bore a pretty Flower in the Spring. ——— At Pisa in the Physic-Garden they shew&#x27;d me that Tree in Bloom as the Manna-Ash. The Tree is indeed common enough in that Neighbourhood: I wonder Mr. Ray does not mention it among the Plants found there by him. The Italians call it Orno. A Botanist at Rome told me it was the Ormus Officinarum. A Physician at Benevento to the same Purpose, that it was the Ormus used in Medicine. A Person is gone from Rome to Naples, who has promised to be very particular in getting you Information of their Manner of curing it. He was bred a Chemist, and told me many Ways of counterfeiting the several Appearances of it. The most common is with Glau-ber&#x27;s Salts and Sugar, with a small Mixture of Manna. The Price of Manna at Naples, they told me, was 4 Carlines (4½d. Sterling each) the Rotolo (32 Ounces).</div>
