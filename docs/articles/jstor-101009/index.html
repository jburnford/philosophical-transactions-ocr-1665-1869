<div class="ocr-text">17. The Walls that keep in the hot springs are very deep-set, and large; 10. foot thick, and 14. deep from the level of the street. The cement of the wall is tallow, clay, lime and beaten bricks. In the year 1659, the Hot-bath (a Bath particularly so call&#x27;d, of equall heat with the Kings-bath) was much impaired by the breaking out of a Spring, which the workmen at last found again, and restored. In digging they came to a firm foundation of factitious matter, which had holes in it like a Pumice-stone, through which the water played; so that &#x27;tis like the Springs are brought together by Art: which probably was the Necromancy, the people of antient times believed and reported to have contrived and made these Baths; as in a very antient manuscript Chronicle I find these words: When Lud Hidibras was dead, Bladud his Son, a great Nygromancer (so &#x27;tis there writ) was made King, and he made the wonder of the hot Bath by his Nygromancy, and he reigned 21. years, and after he died, and lies at the new Troy. And in another old Chronicle &#x27;tis said, That King Bladud sent for Necromancers to Athens to effect this great business, who &#x27;tis like were no other then cunning Artificers, well skill&#x27;d in Architecture and Mechanicks.

18. It hath been observ&#x27;d, that leaves, like those of Olives, come sometimes out of the Pump of the Hot-Bath.

These, Sir, are all the Observations I have been able to collect yet: if any thing else material shall hereafter come to my knowledge about these matters, I shall not fail to impart them, God permitting. Perhaps these things may administer occasion to more Questions relating to the Bath, and their Phenomena. If you or any other ingenious person of the R. Society shall propose any to me, I shall take what care I can to have them punctually answer&#x27;d. I am &amp;c.

Extract of a Letter,
Written by Mr. Muraltus of Zurich, to M. Haak, a Fellow of the R. Society, concerning the Icy and Chrystalin Mountains of Helvetia, call&#x27;d the Gletscher. English&#x27;d out of Latin by the Publisher, as follows;

The highest icy Mountains of Helvetia about Valeria and Augusta, in the Canton of Bern, about Taminium and Travetsch of the Rhetians, are always seen cover&#x27;d with Snow
Snow. The Snow, melted by the heat of the Summer, other Snow being fallen within a little while after, is hardened into Ice, which by little and little in a long tract of time depurating itself turns into a Stone, not yielding in hardness and cleanness to Crystal. Such Stones closely joined and compacted together compose a whole Mountain, and that a very firm one; though in Summer-time the Country-people have observed it to burst asunder with great cracking, Thunder-like: which is also well known to Hunters to their great cost, forasmuch as such cracks and openings, being by the Winds covered with Snow, are the death of those, that pass over them.

At the foot of these mountains are with great labour digg&#x27;d out Crystals, which are found among other fossils, of two sorts and colors; some of them are darkish and troubled, which by some are call&#x27;d the Crystal-ore, to be plentifully found in the ascent of Mount Gotthard; others transparent, very pure and as clear as Venice-glass; sexangular, great and small: as in the mountains about Valaisia, and the Town call&#x27;d Urselen at the foot of the Hill Schelennin they are digg&#x27;d out, and sold at a good rate. Of this latter kind my Parents, four years agoe, transmitted a very bigg and fair one to Milan for 80. pound sterling.

This is, what I have observed about these Hills; What I shall farther learn of the people, inhabiting thereabout, to whom I have written a month since, I shall impart to you.

In September 1668.

Some Observations

Concerning Japan, made by an Ingenious person, that hath many years resided in that Country; as they were communicated in French by M. I.; whence they are thus English&#x27;d by the Publisher; who some months since occasion&#x27;d this Attempt by some Queries, sent to that Traveller.

1. The Japanese doubt not at all of their Country&#x27;s being an Island; though it be separated from the Continent by such narrow Channels that no vessel of any considerable burden can pass them.</div>
