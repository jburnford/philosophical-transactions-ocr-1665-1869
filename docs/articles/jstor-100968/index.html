<div class="ocr-text">a suspicion, that the peculiar constitution of the Air in that Larder, and at that time, may as well deserve to be taken into consideration, as the peculiar nature of the Animals whose flesh did shine, is a question, that I, who have scarce time to name it, must not presume to do any more than name. And therefore as soon as I have begg&#x27;d your pardon for this tedious though hasty scribble, I shall without Ceremony subscribe myself, &amp;c.

A Description of an odd kind of Mushroom, yeilding a Milky Juice, much hotter upon the tongue than Pepper, &amp;c. Observed by Mr. Lister, and by him communicated to the Publisher, Novemb. 15. 1672.

The 18. of August last I passed through Marton woods, under Pinno-moor in Craven: In these Woods I then found an infinite number of Mushrooms, some wither&#x27;d, and others new-sprung and flourishing. They were of a large size, something bigger than the Ordinary red-gilled eatable Mushroom or Champignon, and very much of their shape, that is, with a perfectly round Cap, or Stool (as we vulgarly call it,) thick in flesh and with open Gills underneath; having a thick, fleshy, not-hollow, and round Foot-stalk, of about 6 fingers breadth high above ground, and ordinarily as thick as my thumb. If you cut any part of this Mushroom, it will bleed exceeding freely a Milk-white Juice, concerning which note: 1. That this Milky Juice tasteth much hotter upon the tongue than Pepper. 2. That it is not clammy to the touch. 3. That the Air does not much discolour it, or the blade of a knife; as is usual with most Vegetable Juices. 4. That it became in the glass-viol, I drew it into, suddenly concret and stiff, and did in some daies dry into a firm Cake. 5. That it then also, when well dried, retain&#x27;d its fierce biting tast and white colour.

Further, I observ&#x27;d these Mushrooms, full of Juice, not to be endured upon our tongues, to abound with Fly-maggots.
Also, the youngest and tenderest of them, that is, such as are most juicy, to have been very much eaten by the grey meadow naked snail, lodging themselves within the sides of the plant.

Concerning this kind of biting Mushroom, I find in a certain late discourse of the State of Russia these words: Groozhoidys Fungorum maximi, pa&#x27;mam lati, in star &amp; nati bibuit sunt, crassii &amp; candidi dum crudi sunt, succo (lacteo putido) abundant. Eos scit Thymallum muria corrigunt Rutheni; aliter fane &amp; guttur inflammat. Ipse semel nimis inconsiderate affatos comedere tentabam, non sine suffocationis periculo. The reference to the Cuts or Figures is here confused, and the description too concise, to say that Ours agrees in anything with Theirs, save the great acrimony of the Juice they both yield.

I may sometime acquaint you with the Medicinal Uses, I have caused to be made of this White Resin: In the meantime I shall only mind you of the great affinity it hath with Euphorbium.

Since this Letter the Author thereof was pleased to give us this further Account in another of Decemb. 17. viz.

—— Mr Wray return&#x27;d me this Answer to my Letter about the biting Mushroom;

&quot;At my return to Midleton I found a Letter from you, containing the Description of a Mushroom by you discovered in Marton woods under Pinno moor. I doubt not but it is that described in Job. Bauhin l. 40. c. 6. under the title of Fungus piperatus albus, lacteo succo turgens. Only he faith; 1. That it doth in bigness exceed the Champignon; whereas you write, that there are few of them much bigger than that: But yet in saying so, you grant them to be bigger. 2. He faith, for their bigness they are not so thick as that; you describe yours to be thick in flesh. In all other points the Descriptions agree exactly. For the colour, that
it is white, Gills and all; for the place, that it grows in woods; and for the taste, that &#x27;tis hotter than Pepper. Several particulars mention&#x27;d by you, are not observ&#x27;d or not mention&#x27;d by him. I cannot say, that I have as yet met with this Mushroom.

An Extract of Mr. Flamstead&#x27;s Letter written to the Publisher from Derby Novemb. 16. 1672. concerning the Appulses, by him calculated for A. 1673. of the Moon, and the other Planets to Fixed Stars; together with an Observation of the Planet Mars, made by the same.

I Herewith send you my Annual task, but flightly done. Indeed my frequent Journeys and domestic business have kept me so employ&#x27;d, that I have not had time to make such Calculations as I intended. I have only noted the Time of the Moons true Conjunction with the Fixed Stars from the Learned Heckerus his Ephemerides, with the point then ascending at London; with a conjecture therefrom, when the Visible Occultations shall happen: from which the intelligent Observer may be sufficiently inform&#x27;d, when to wait for any appearance, and what will be observable.

Besides, having of late observed, with my seven foot Tube, some Appulses of the other Planets to Fixed Stars, and collected all the Observable ones of the next year, I have added them to the Lunar Appulses. Both are very slender labours, but may be very useful.

September last I was at Townley. The first week that I intended to have observed &amp; there with Mr. Townley, I twice observ&#x27;d him, but could not make two Observations, as I intended, in one night. The first night after my return, I had the good hap to measure his distances from two Stars the same night; whereby I find, that his Parallax was very small; certainly not 30 seconds: So that I believe, the Suns Parallax is not more than 10 seconds.
