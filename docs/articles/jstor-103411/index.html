<div class="ocr-text">VI. A farther Account of the same Tree. By William Sherard, LL.D. R.S.S.

The Account I had of the Poyson-Tree from Mr. More (which probably he had from Mr. Dudley) is as follows.

The Poyson-Tree grows to the bigness of Elder; I never saw the Leaf; the Wood is as cold as Ice; when laid on the Fire, of 5 or 6 Persons sitting by it, some will fall a swooning, fainting, or yawning, continuing so for some Days, others but a few Hours, and others of the Company not at all. I handle, cut and burn it with impunity; and so it is with several others, I suppose, according to their several Constitutions. It was never known to kill any body, but only to do hurt to some Persons. I have sent you all the Seeds of it, I can get.

The Seeds he sent were but few, but I had a good quantity from Mr. Catesby in Carolina. He calls it a Water Shrub, of which he never saw Leaf or Flower. Tis a species of *Toxicodendron*, tho&#x27; not nam&#x27;d by Dr. Tournefort in his Institutions, p. 610. but I believe it to be *Arbor Americana alatis foliis, succo lacteo venenata*. Pluknet. Almag. 45. Tab. 145. Fig. 1. which is a Species of *Toxicodendron*, that grew formerly at Chelsea Garden. What makes me think it to be this, is Mr. Dudley&#x27;s writing &#x27;tis like a Sumach, and that it is by some call&#x27;d the Swamp Sumach; this in its manner of growing and alated Leaves, very much
much resembles the Sumach or Rhus; the Fruit is a white roundish dry Berry, growing in Clusters, so like that of Toxicodendron triphyllon folio sinuato, pubescente, Inst. R. Herb. 611. Hederæ trifoliæ Canadensis affinis planta: Arbor venenata quorundam H. R. Parif. as scarce to be distinguish&#x27;d from it.

VII. An Account of a Method lately found out in New-England, for Discovering where the Bees Hive in the Woods, in order to get their Honey. By the same Mr. Dudley.

The Hunter in a clear Sun-shiny day, takes a Plate or Trencher, with a little Sugar, Honey or Molasses spread on it, and when got into the Woods, sets it down on a Rock or Stump in the Woods: this the Bees soon scent and find out; for &#x27;tis generally supposed a Bee will scent Honey or Wax above a Mile&#x27;s distance. The Hunter secures in a Box or other Conveniency, one or more of the Bees as they fill themselves, and after a little time, lets one of them go, observing very carefully the Course the Bee steers; for after he rises in the Air, he flies directly, or upon a straight Course to the Tree where the Hive is.

In order to this, the Hunter carries with him his Pocket Compass, his Rule, and other Implements, with a Sheet of Paper, and sets down the Course, suppose it be West; by this he is sure the Tree must be somewhere in a West Line from where he is, but wants to know the exact Distance from his Station,</div>
