Where-ever it is said, at the Head of any Paper, Here printed with Additions, or with Alterations; It is to be understood, that the Author of such Paper made such Additions or Alterations himself; for None of them have been made by the Editor. And where it is said, Presented on such a Day; It implies that the Paper was not read; the Contents of it being of such a Nature as not to be understood at a bare Reading; and that therefore the Subject in general was only mentioned, or the Title read.
