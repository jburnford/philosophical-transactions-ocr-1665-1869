<div class="ocr-text">An ingenious Retra&amp;ation of the 7th and last Paragraph of Mr. William Molyneux&#x27;s Letter in the Philosophical Transact. Numb. 158. pag 554. concerning Lough Neagh Stone and its non application to the Magnet upon calcination. Being an abstract of a Letter of the same ingenious Gentleman dated from Dublin Novemb. 25. 1684.

&#x27;TIS now a good while since, I gave you some account of our Lough-Neagh Stone and its petrifying qualities, which I hear you have thought worthy to insert in one of your Transactions; in which discourse I must desire you to correct one Paragraph, and undeceive the World in a particular there mention&#x27;d; which is, that Lough-Neagh Stone, neither crude nor calcined, would apply to the Magnet: that it will not do so crude, I still affirm; but that it does not apply calcin&#x27;d, I must retract: for I find by further trial, that it apply&#x27;s calcin&#x27;d most briskly, and in great quantities, to the Magnet: The occasion of my former error being, that I did not calcine it long enough. If upon a fit opportunity you would do me justice in this particular, you will much oblige me, and vindicate my credit. Sir, I am

Your most humble Servant,

William Molyneux:</div>
