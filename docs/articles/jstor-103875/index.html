Remarks
Remarks on the Meteorological Observations of the Year 1728.

As the Observations of this Year, which the Royal Society hath received from many, and very distant Parts of the World, are two large and numerous to be printed in the Philosophical Transactions, or read at the Society&#x27;s Meetings; so to make them as useful as possible, I have put as many of them as I could into Tables, to be seen and compared at an easy View, as I have done in former Years: But I am forced to omit such of them, where no Account is given of the Instruments they used, or where none were made use of at all, but only verbal Descriptions given, that Tables would not admit of. But the Places mentioned in the Tables, had the Society&#x27;s Glasses of Mr. Haukesbee&#x27;s making.

The Barometrical Observations I need not satiate the Society with Remarks upon, because I have made divers of that Kind, upon the preceding Years: only I shall repeat two Things that I formerly took notice of, and have had frequent Confirmations of this Year; viz. 1. The great Conformity of the Ascents, Descents, and Stations of the Mercury in the Barometer. 2. That the Range of the Mercury is much greater in the Northerly than Southerly Climes.

As for the Thermometrical Observations, I have inserted all that were made with the Royal Society&#x27;s Glasses: but such as were made with other Thermometers, it would have been of little or no use to have taken notice of them, unless I could have reduced them
to some known Measure; which only two of the curious Observers enabled me to do; but I found that a Matter so perplexed and difficult, as not to answer the great Trouble of it, especially considering that these Tables exhibit Observations made in different and distant Parts, viz. Italy, Germany, England, and Sweden, by which an Estimate may be, in some measure, made of the Temperature of those different Climates of the World. In order to which, I must repeat what I mentioned in some preceding Year; that in the Royal Society&#x27;s Glasses, the Point of Extream Heat is 5 Degrees above 0, that Temperature is 45 Degrees below 0, and Freezing at 65 Degrees. And if we cast our Eye upon the several Months, particularly those of Winter, especially if we consider that which I have remark&#x27;d in 1727, from Dr. Cyril, concerning the Freezing-Point at Naples to be at 55 Degrees, which is at London at 65 Degrees, and at Christiana and Bengal probably as different also. I say, considering these Things, it is surprizing that the Heat and Cold of those distant Places, is not as different as their Northerly and Southerly Situations. But at Lunden, I was surprized to find the Thermometer much lower in the warmer Months than at Upsale, or any other of the Swedish places, &#x27;till I found that in all those Months, they had continual Cold and Rain, when the other places mention little but Fair, or Cloudy, and but little Rain or Cold. And this minds me of a former Observation, That Cold is the Parent of Wet, especially in Summer.

As to the Winds and Weather, so many are the Places of Observation, and so many and so various the Observations, that its next to impossible to give
a tolerable Abridgment of them: and therefore my Remarks on the foregoing Years, especially on the same Places* and Parts of the World, must suffice here.

The Quantity of Rain and Snow were observed at Naples, Rising, Bettina, Upsale, Hudickswald, and Southwick: but I find no Description of the Instruments wherewith they observed, nor of their Measures, except at Southwick and Naples, and therefore am forced to omit all but the two latter, in which the Depth is measured by English Measure, the Southwick, by Inches, and hundredth Parts of an Inch; and the Naples, by English Inches, and the Observer&#x27;s Measures, 23 of which make an English Inch.

Lastly, That I may omit as little as may be of what the illustrious Observers take notice of, I shall add the Meteors they mention, together with some of my own, that happened about the same Time.

The first was a Lumen boreale at Bettina, in the Night after Mar. 20; and at half an Hour after 8 on Mar. 22, at Windsor, I saw an unusual sort of Streaming, in which the Columns were not (as usually) conical, or pointed, nor rising towards the Zenith-point; but were with parallel Sides, and rose perpendicularly to the Horizon. They were very bright, emitting a Light equal to that of the Moon in her Quarters. Also they rose from a Bank of Vapours, not curved at Top (as usually) but lacinated, or broken.

Also on Mar. 24, the curious Bettina Observer faith, there was, the Night before, Lumen Efflamans boreale; which was also seen at Laefanger.

On August 26, at Night was a remarkable Lumen boreale at Bettina. And the Night before at 10 Hours

* Vide Transact. n. 433, p. 334. &amp; seq.
20 Minutes p.m. a Gentleman going from my House, saw towards the East, about 30 Degrees high, a Ball of Fire, about 4 Inches Diameter, blazing, and standing still at first, and presently after, it ran towards the North, and in about five, or more Minutes, he heard an Explosion like Thunder. Its Blaze emitted a Light equal to that of the Moon at Full.

At the same Time, the Newspapers say, a Light in the Sky, like a Comet, was seen at Watford in Hertfordshire, with Sparks of Fire issuing from its Tail; that then it brake out with a prodigious Lustre, like the Sun, which lasted not long, and was followed with a terrible Clap of Thunder, the Stars twinkling all the while, and not a Cloud to be seen. Which Clap, I doubt not, was the same which my Friend heard, and which was five or more Minutes in its Passage hither.

At Bettina, Lumina borealia were seen on the Nights after Sep. 18, 19, and 24; the second of which covered half the Heavens. And on Sep. 21, about 10 Hours p.m. I observed, at Upminster; an unusual sort of Tan-coloured thick Vapours towards the N.W.h.N. but withal lightsome, and such as the Stars might be seen through. And after some Time, they sent forth, in divers Places, Streaming Lances, gently and gradually coming and going.

On Oct. 13, I saw that uncommon sort of Streaming at Redbridge, near Southampton, the Account of which is printed in Philos. Trans. No. 410, and the same Night at Bettina was Lumen boreale eruans Flammam, as the Observer expresses it. At Laefanger also those Streamings were on the same Night, and on the 15th, 18th, 19th, and 23rd.
On Oct. 19th, a Parhelius was at Lunden, and on the 22nd a Lumen boreale at Wittemberge.

On Nov. 12th, at Windsor, we had considerable Streaming; and the same was at Bettina and Umea; and on the 29th at Laefanger; and again at Umea on Dec. 24.

An APPENDIX to the Remarks on 1728, and some of the Years preceding it.

After I had finished the foregoing Observations on the Year 1728, I received the curious Observations of the illustrious Marquis Poleni, made at Padua,* for six Years; such of which as are conformable to mine, I shall subjoin by way of Appendix.

The first Thing he gives an Account of is, the Quantity of Rain and Snow (in English Measure, and according to the Old Stile) that fell before and after this Year 1728, in six Years Time, in the following Table.

From this Table he observes, that the Februaries were the driest Months, and 1726, the driest Year in all the Six, and that the Octobers were the wettest Months, and 1728 the wettest of all the six Years.

Further also he faith, that in the four Seasons of the Years (reckoning their beginning from the 10th Day of their respective Months, viz. of December, March, June and September; that I say) less Wet falls in Winter and Spring, than in Summer and Autumn, and that the wet Weather increases, as the Seasons advance; that in Winter is the least Wet; that it increaseth in Spring; is more in Summer; and most of all in Autumn.

For the Proof of this, he hath made a Table of the mean Quantities of the Rain in the four Seasons of each of the six Years; the Sums of which six Years Rain, are in Winter, 39.490 Inches; in Spring, 52.188 Inches; in Summer, 58.25 Inches; and in the Autumn, 74.558 Inches. But in the many Years that I observed the Weather at Upminster, I find it not so.

After these Observations of the Weather, the illustrious Marquis proceeds to the Barometrical Indications of it; and hath made Tables of the Rising and Falling of the Quicksilver, together with the Coast of the Winds, both against Rain, and also against Snow, hoping to predict from thence the several sorts of Weather. But I omit the Tables, because I think little of general use can be concluded from them but what is commonly known.

I omit also his Table * of the Sum and Mean Altitudes of the Barometer, and Thermometer; but his following Table may be of use.

From this Table it appears, from the Highest and Lowest Stations in the six Years, that the greatest Range of the Barometer, is 1.84 Inches; but at Naples, it is only 94 Centesimal of an Inch; and what it was at other Places, I have given some Account of in my Remarks on 1727.

The illustrious Observer hath also been very curious, and sedulous in his Observations of the Thermometer; which I am sorry I can give no acceptable Account of, for want of so much Knowledge of his Thermometer, as may enable me to compare his Observations with mine.

He hath also compared with his own, the Quantities of Rain, and the Barometrical Range observed at Paris, by M. de la Hire; and finds that the Paris
Paris Rain is $16.4\frac{1}{2}$ Lines, and the Barometrical Range $2\frac{1}{2}$ Lines more than the Padua.

The last Thing which the illustrious Marquis takes notice of is the Magnetical Declination, which he faith is $13$ Degrees West, and hath decreased in the six Years $\frac{1}{60}$ths; that every Day there is a small Alteration in the Declination, so that it doth not continue the same a whole Day together; that the Declination of all needles (especially if touched by different Magnets) is different a few Sexagesims. But these Niceties I recommend to the Enquiry of the Curious, because they disagree with the Observations of Gilbert, and most of the Magnetic Writers.
