<div class="ocr-text">II. An Account of a Negro-Boy that is dappel&#x27;d in several Places of his Body with White Spots. By Will. Byrd, Esq., F. R. S.

There is now in England, in the Possession of Captain Charles Wager, a Negro-Boy, of about Eleven Years Old, who was born in the upper Parts of Rappahannock River, in Virginia: His Father and Mother were both perfect Negroes, and Servants to a Gentleman of that Country, one Major Taylor. This Boy, till he came to be Three Years Old, was in all Respects, like other Black Children, and then without having any Distemper, began to have several little White Specks in his Neck and upon his Breast, which, with his Age, have since been observed to increase very much, both in Number and Bigness; so that now from the upper part of his Neck (where some of his Wool is already turn&#x27;d White) down to his Knees he is everywhere dappel&#x27;d with White Spots, some of which are broader than the Palm of a Man&#x27;s Hand, and others of a smaller Proportion. The Spots are wonderfully White, at least equal to the Skin of the fairest Lady, and have the Advantage in this, that they are not liable to be Tann&#x27;d. But they are, I think, of a Paler White, and do not show Flesh and Blood so lively through them as the Skin of White People, but possibly the Reason of that may be, because the Skin of a Negro is much thicker. This Boy never had any Sickness, but has all along been very Sprightly and Active, and has more Ingenuity too, than is common to that Generation. His Spots grow continually larger and larger, and &#x27;tis probable, if he lives, he may in time become
all over White; but his Face, Arms and Legs are perfectly Black.

III. A true and exact Relation of the dismal and surprising Effects of a terrible and unusual Clap of Thunder with Lightning, that fell upon the Trumbull-Galley, on Thursday the 26th Day of November, 1696. Communicated in a Letter unto Mr. W. Griffith, M. A. by Mr. Robert Mawgridge, Kettle-Drummer unto his Majesty, and then Surgeon of the said Galley.

Here give you a faithful Account of a sad and astonishing Accident, that happened unto our Galley by Lightning and Thunder. For as we lay at Anchor at Smirna, about One of the Clock in the Morning, upon the 26th Day of November, 1696. She was staved in several Places: The Bulk-Head of her Round-House was staved all to Pieces into the Captain&#x27;s Cabbin, and hurt his Shoulder. Her Mizzen-Mast was staved all to Pieces; and the Spindle in the Head of the Mast was melted at both Ends with the Lightning. The Main-Top-Sail-Yard was lash&#x27;d in the Top; yet notwithstanding, the Yard was thrown out, and stuck in our Awning right an End. The Quarter-master (one John Page) was on the Deck by the Mizzen-Mast, and one John Allen; who were Both struck down flat thereon with the Lightning: Page had one Side of him stupified for Three Days; but, under God, I recovered him in Six Days. Allen was very well, when his Fright was over; but</div>
