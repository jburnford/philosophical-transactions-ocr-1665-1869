<div class="ocr-text">from our tables, that $A$ must be 35 years of age; therefore find, by the twenty-third proposition, the value of an annuity of a life for 35 to continue for a limited time of 31 years: let that value be sub-
ducted from the value of an annuity certain, to con-
tinue 31 years; and the remainder will be the value
of the reversion.

XI. The Appearance of a fiery Meteor, as seen
by Mr. Cradock, communicated to the Royal
Society by Mr. Henry Baker, F. R. S.

Read June 7. 1744.

THE Head and Body emitted an ex-
tremely lucid and white Flame.
The Tail appeared of a transparent Blue, like the
Flame of Sulphur.

This Phenomenon was seen on Sunday, May 27.
1744. at 11 Minutes after 11 o’Clock at Night: Its
Direction from S. E. to N. W. or thereabouts; its
Height seemingly not half a Mile.

It was seen, as here described, from the Terrace
in Somerset-Gardens, by me,

Zach. Cradock,
Of Somerset-House.</div>
