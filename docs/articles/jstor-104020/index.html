An Explanation of the TABLES.

The first Column contains the Month; the second Column is the Day of the Month; the third the Hour of the Day, beginning at Six in the Morning, to Twelve at Noon, and Nine at Night; the fourth Column is that of the Thermoscope; the fifth Column is the Height of the Mercury in the Baroscope, the first Number is the Inches of its Height, the second and third Number marks the tenths and hundredth Parts of an Inch; the sixth Column is the Latitude the Ship is in, by Account, every Day at Noon; the seventh Column is the Longitude the Ship is in every Day at Noon, by Account, from the Meridian of London (except where otherwise express&#x27;d). The Column Variation, is the Variation of the Needle; and the next four Columns are the Latitudes observ&#x27;d at Noon by four several new Instruments; the first is Mr. Smith&#x27;s Prismatic Quadrant, the second is Mr. Hadley&#x27;s, the third by Mr. John Elton, and the fourth by Mr. Caleb Smith and Mr. William Ward; the next Column is the Wind for the most Part of the Twenty-four Hours.

The Thermoscope which I made use of in the Voyage, was made by Mr. John Patrick, together with the Baroscope; in his Thermoscope he places [°] at the Top, supposing it to be the Heat under the Line, and so the Figures increase downwards, with the Increase of Cold. Temperate is placed at 25.

This Prismatic Quadrant of Mr. Caleb Smith I find to be of very great Use at Sea, in particular for the Stars, as I have experienced several times in my Voyage to Hudson&#x27;s Bay, in the worst of Weather, when you can but see the Horizon; and his other is of great Use, in tolerable smooth Water, in foggy and hazy Weather, when there is no Horizon to be seen, yet have the Benefit of the Sun.</div>
