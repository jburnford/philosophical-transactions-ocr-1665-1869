<div class="ocr-text">II. HISTOIRE NATURELLE DES ANIMAUX PLANTES ET MINERAUX, qui entrent dans la composition de la THERIAQUE D&#x27;ANDROMACHUS; par M. Charas In 12, A Paris.

As there are above 60 sorts of different druggs, which are ingredients of this no less difficult than famous and usefull Medicine, which was invented by Andromachus, physician to Nero; and as those drugs are subject to be sophisticated, and require different preparations, so there are few men, that are sufficiently skill&#x27;d to chuse aright all those ingredients, or dextrous and patient enough to prepare them well. The Author of this Book treats of this celebrated medicament, and not only teacheth the way of composing it, but intersperseth many not in considerable remarks touching the nature and vertues of all the Druggs, which compose it.

He is of opinion, that commonly there are committed many faults in preparing the Ingredients, of which the Theriack is made up. E.g. When the Vipers are prepared, the custom is to whip them; thereby to make all the venom go to the head, which is cut off when they are sufficiently enraged. They also boile the flesh, thereby to draw forth what venemousness may yet rest therein, and their bones are cast away as useless. Whereas he saith, that it being by Experience evident, that all the venom of the Viper is in his Teeth and Jaws, that whipping is not only to no purpose, but also dangerous, in regard that the Spirits being chafed and irritated may beget venom in the body, where was none. He affirms also, that the water, in which the viper-flesh is boyled, carryes away all the vertue; and that the bones that are thrown away are no less useful, than the flesh itself.

He takes further notice, that Opium hath not those ill qualities, which many ascribe to it, who teach that it suffocateth the natural heat, and that there need no more than 3. grains to dispatch the lustiest man: whereas he affirms, that himself hath taken 6 grains of it without having been more stupified by it, than he used to be; and that instead of being debilitated, he hath found himself strengthened by it. He adds, that he knows a man of a constitution delicate enough, who hath taken of it to 30. grains, and yet not found any troublesome accident upon it; on the contrary that the Patient hath found himself so well after it, that he continued to take the same dose twice or thrice a week.

He observes also, that whereas it hath been disputed, what might cause the difference of Colour in the White and Black Pepper, some believing that Pepper gathered before it was ripe, looked white, but became black in ripening; others pretending, that as the same Vine-stocks, which produce white grapes, do not bear black ones, so they are different plants, that bear Pepper of different colour; our Author affirms, that this diversity of Colours proceeds thence, that the black Pepper is covered by its skin, which the white is bared of &amp;c.
