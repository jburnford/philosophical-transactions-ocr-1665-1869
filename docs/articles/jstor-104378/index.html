Example: If $m:m:1::1000:22$, then the greatest Difference of the meridional Parts in the Sphere and Spheroid is 76.0929 Minutes: In other Cases it is found by multiplying the Remainder above-mentioned by 1174.078.

XV. The parabolic Orbit for the Comet of 1739. observed by Signor Eustachio Zanotti at Bologna.

The Motion in its own proper Orbit was retrograde.

The Perihelion was in . . . §. 5. 11.
The descending Node in . v. 25. 18.
The Perihelion from the Node 69. 53.

The Comet was in the Perihelion June 9. 9. 59.
in the desc. Node July 18. 4. 57.

The Perihelion of the Comet’s Orbit was within the Sphere of the Orbit of Venus, and without that of the Orbit of Mercury; being distant from the Sun 0.69614 Parts of the Earth’s mean Distance from the Sun.

The Plane of the Orbit stood inclined to the Plane of the Ecliptic in an Angle of 53°. 25&#x27;.

The Diurnal mean Motion, according as it is interpreted by Dr. Halley in his Elements of cometical Astronomy, was 1°.5707.
