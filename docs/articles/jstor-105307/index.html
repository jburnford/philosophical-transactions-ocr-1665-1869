LXXXII. An Account of an Earthquake felt at Lingfield in Surrey, and Edenbridge in Kent, on the 24th of January 1758. By James Burrow, Esq; R. S. V. P.

Read April 6, 1758.

In the London Chronicle, No. 181, published on the 25th of February 1758, in page 185, is the following article: &quot;We hear, that about two o&#x27;clock in the morning of the 24th of last month&quot; (which was the month of January), &quot;an Earthquake was felt in the parishes of Worthe, and East-Grinted, in Sussex; Lingfield, in Surrey; and Edenbridge, in Kent; and other adjacent places: which alarmed several of the inhabitants very much; but no damage ensued.&quot;

Mr. Burrow, having some connection with these two last parishes of Lingfield and Edenbridge, immediately wrote to the Rev. Mr. Goodricke of Lingfield, to inquire into the truth of this report: and Mr. Goodricke&#x27;s answer confirmed the fact of its being felt there, and at other adjacent places; and added, &quot;that it shook the beds and windows, and made
&quot;made the plates rattle; and went off with a noise,
&quot;like a small gust of wind.&quot;

However, Mr. Burrow did not then judge it to be
either regular or proper to trouble the Society with
this account; because Mr. Goodricke only received
it from hearsay and report, he himself happening to
be absent from Lingfield at that time.

But Mr. Burrow having passed some days, during
the late recess of the Society, at a place called Star-
borough-castle, which lies nearly between the two
churches of Lingfield and Edenbridge (scarce four
miles distant from each other), he has had an oppor-
tunity of being more particularly and circumstan-
tially informed of the fact, as far as relates to those
two parishes: and he is now assured, that it was cer-
tainly and undoubtedly felt and observed by some
persons in each of those two parishes; tho&#x27; (as it
happened in the dead of the night, when most peo-
ple were fast asleep) it was not generally perceived:
nor was it much spoken of, even by those, who
were sure they felt it.

The persons, from whose own mouths he can
authenticate the fact, are James Martin, Adam Kil-
lick, Mrs. Jewell, and Mr. Chapman: and he has
no less doubt as to Mr. Orgles and Mrs. Pigott (who
was waked and much frighted by it), tho&#x27; he did not
indeed personally converse with either of the two last.

These two, and Mrs. Jewell, all inhabit quite close
to Lingfield church-yard, on different sides of it:
and Chapman lives within a quarter of a mile of it,
to the south-west.

James Martin lives within a bow-shot of Star-
borough-castle, at the eastern edge of the parish of
Lingfield,
Lingfield, where it joins to that of Edenbridge; and Adam Killick&#x27;s habitation is three miles north-east of Starborough, at the north-western point of the parish of Edenbridge.

All these four, with whom Mr. Burrow personally conversed, agreed as to the time of the concussion; viz., between one and two in the morning: and they all agreed as to the shaking of their beds and windows; and all of them described the continuance of the shock as not much more than instantaneous: but they did not all hear the noise, which some of them observed it to conclude with; particularly Adam Killick heard no noise at all; and yet, he says, he was broad awake when it first began: and it shook his house and bed, and made his windows rattle so much, that he was apprehensive of their being broken; and even caused one pane of glass (which was indeed loose before) actually to drop out. But James Martin, who was likewise fully awake (as was his wife too), did bear the noise distinctly. He says, he felt his house and bed shake, heard his windows rattle, and some earthen ware clatter upon a chest of drawers; and also heard a noise, like the distant discharge of a cannon: whereupon he immediately said to his wife, &quot;Lord! what is that?&quot; but she happening, at that very instant, either to cough or sneeze (she cannot recollect which of the two), did not, tho&#x27; quite awake, perceive any thing at all of the matter. However, she confirmed her husband&#x27;s asking her this question under an apparent surprize.

Mr. Burrow had a very particular conversation with these two separately: and he had also a very minute detail from Adam Killick (who works for him
him as a sort of gardener at Starborough); who further added, &quot;that the shock waked and frighted his wife, tho&#x27; she was fast asleep before.&quot;

LXXXIII. An Account of the Case of the First Joint of the Thumb torn off, with the Flexor Tendon in its whole Extent torn out. By Robert Home, late Surgeon to the Thirtieth Regiment of Foot, and Surgeon at Kingston upon Hull. In a Letter to John Pringle, M.D. F.R.S.

SIR,

Read April 6, 1758. I take the liberty of inclosing to you a case in surgery, which I imagine is not very common. Marchetis indeed has an observation of the same kind; and there are several others collected together by Mons. Morand, in the second volume of the Memoires of the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris: but as I have not heard of that volume&#x27;s being translated into English, and believe there is no observation of a similar nature in the Philosophical Transactions, I beg the favour of you to communicate it to the Royal Society, of which you are a Fellow; and at the same time to make them an offer of the joint of the thumb, with its adherent tendon, which you will receive at the</div>
