<div class="ocr-text">An Abstract of a Letter from the Learned Dr. Cole Physician at Worcester, dated May the 13th, 1685, concerning Stones Voided per Penem.

Sir,

If the exclusion of two Stones (of the bigness Fig.: 10, and 11) by the penis, without any, or any considerable pain, be worth notice, be pleased to know, I had the account of it from the person that Voided them. I saw the Stones and took the bigness, and circumference, (of which the strait line is the measure, they being in the thickest part much of a bigness) of them, by tracing lines about them as they lay upon a paper for the shape, and measuring them with a thread for the circumference. He told me he was for many years subject to great pain, first in the Kidneys, and afterwards in the Bladder, when that in the Kidneys ceased. But since their exclusion (which was about a year since) he was free from pain till the time I saw him, which was (as I remember) about half a year since.
