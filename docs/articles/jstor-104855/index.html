<div class="ocr-text">be safely used for a long time, without Danger to Health, I can vouch by my own Experience; for a Quart of Lime-Water, and an Ounce of Soap, has never given me the least Nauseating, Lowness of Spirits, or Abatement of Appetite, and I think I was never better in Health than I am now.

My Motive for being so particular in this Affair, is a Desire to be instrumental, by your means, of giving Ease to others in so unhappy a Condition; being firmly persuaded, that what has already so far reliev&#x27;d me, will, if prescrib&#x27;d, dissolve Stones of greater Magnitude than I suppose mine to be.

Abergavenny, Dec. Your affectionate Brother,
