ALL Persons concern&#x27;d in the Practice of Inoculating the Small Pox, are desir&#x27;d to send to Dr. Jurin, Secretary to the Royal Society, any time before the End of February next, an Account of the Name and Age of every Person inoculated by them, from the Beginning to the End of the present Year, the Place where it was done, the Manner of the Operation, the Days of Sicken ing and of the Eruption, what Sort of Small-Pox was produc&#x27;d, and the Event.

Where the true Small-Pox was not produced by Inoculation, it will be of use to take particular Notice, whether the Patient had any other kind of Eruption, what Symptoms preceded, or attended it, whether the Incisions inflam&#x27;d and run, and for what Time their running continued.

In case of any Person&#x27;s dying after Inoculation, either in the Course of the Small-Pox, or after they are gone off, it is desir&#x27;d that a particular Relation of the Case may be sent, attested, if it be judged necessary, by the nearest Relations of the Party deceased, or by other credible Persons, that were Witnesses to the Fact.

Such Gentlemen as have not already sent in their Accounts for the preceding Year, are now requested to communicate them.

Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields,
Decemb. 7, 1724.

LONDON: Printed for W. and J. Innys, Printers to the Royal Society, at the West End of St. Paul&#x27;s Church-yard.</div>
