And in the same manner we are to proceed to the succeeding Zones, &#x27;till the whole Globe is cover&#x27;d. And the Method will not differ in any material Circumstance, if instead of a whole Globe, we are to construct any Part of it only, or what I here call a Spherical Map.

To reduce this Theory to Practice, and as a Specimen of Spherical Maps, I have constructed a Terrestrial Hemisphere to a Diameter of near 15 Inches: To which I have given the Name of the British Hemisphere, because it has Great-Britain in the Center, or rather at its Vertex. It is therefore adapted to the Meridian and Horizon of London, and exhibits one half of the Earth&#x27;s Surface, as it lies round about this City; which is vastly the most considerable Part of the whole Earth&#x27;s Superficies. The Longitude and Latitude of Places are here easily known by Inspection, and their Bearing and Distances may be nearly estimated: And all the Delineations are as accurate and particular as this small Radius would permit. I conceive therefore it may be no unfit Instrument for instructing Beginners, or for initiating young Minds in the first Rudiments of Geography.
