VII. An Experiment to compare the Paris Weights as they are now us&#x27;d at Paris, with the English Weights. By the Reverend J. T. Desaguliers, LL.D. F.R.S.

Finding the Accounts which we have of the French Weights different in different Books, I sent to a curious Gentleman for some Paris Weights exact to the Standard Weights at the Chatelet; and found upon tryal, the Paris Ounce, which contains 576 of their Grains, to be equal to 476 of our Grains Troy; from which Experiment all the other Proportions may be deduc&#x27;d.

The French Pound cont. 16 Ounces.
Ounce —— 8 Drams, or 576 Paris Grains.
Dram —— 3 Deniers.
Denier —— 24 Grains.
