<div class="ocr-text">XLVIII. A Letter of Mr. William Shervington to Benjamin Franklin, Esq; of Philadelphia, concerning the Transit of Mercury over the Sun, on the 6 of May 1753, as observed in the Island of Antigua: Communicated by Mr. Peter Collinson, F. R. S.

SIR,

Antigua, June 20, 1753.

Read Nov. 15, 1753.

Mr. Benjamin Mecom having received half a dozen circulatory letters from you relating to Mercury&#x27;s transit over the sun the 6 of last May, he put them into my hands. One would have sufficed for our island, as we are not overburthen&#x27;d with men, who have a taste that way. Hereunder I send you the result of my observation * thereof.

Sunday, May 6, at $6^h\ 7&#x27;\ 51&#x27;&#x27;$, I observed the western limb of Mercury to touch the western limb of the sun; and, at $6^h\ 10&#x27;\ 37&#x27;&#x27;$, he touch&#x27;d the same with his eastern limb, and totally disappear&#x27;d. Lat. of the place $17^\circ\ 0&#x27; N$. Lon. by estimation $61^\circ\ 45&#x27;$ W. from London.

This was taken by a Graham&#x27;s watch, and corrected by two altitudes taken by a most exquisite quadrant; viz.

* Dr. Charles Rose, who was in Antigua at this time, says, that these observations were taken by Capt. Richard Tyrrel, of the said island,
At 6h 58&#x27; 7&quot;, I observed the distance of the sun&#x27;s upper limb from the zenith = 72° 21&#x27; 30&quot;. And, at 9h 31&#x27; 5&quot;, I observed the same = 36° 17&#x27; 0&quot;.

By the common process (which you may have, if necessary) I found the watch was 0° 4&#x27; 4&quot; 28&quot; too fast *; therefore,

\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\text{From} &amp; = &amp; = &amp; 6 \ 10 \ 37 \\
\text{Take} &amp; = &amp; = &amp; 0 \ 4 \ 4 \ 28 \\
\end{array}
\]

True apparent time of Mercs. exit here, 6 6 32 32

Pray impart your observation to

Your Well-wisher,

William Shervington.

* Mr. Shervington has taken the mean of these two altitudes from the error of his watch; and there can be no doubt that his observation is a good one, which, compared with that made in Surry-street by Mr. Short, p. 199, l. i. &amp;c. fixes the longitude of the place of his observation in Antigua 4h 5&#x27; 30&quot;, or 61° 22&#x27; 30&quot;, west of St. Paul&#x27;s, London.</div>
