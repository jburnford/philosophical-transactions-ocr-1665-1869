The number of inhabitants actually surveyed every five years for thirty years.

| Year | Number |
|------|--------|
| 1755 | 1049   |
| 1760 | 1048   |
| 1765 | 1096   |
| 1770 | 1046   |
| 1775 | 1057   |
| 1780 | 1113   |

The increase of 48 persons in the year 1765 was owing to the ingress of four numerous families into large houses, which were almost uninhabited for many years before.
The decrease of 50 persons in the year 1770 was occasioned by the demolishing of nine houses, in order to open a way to the new stone bridge built over the river Severn.

On Good Friday, 1774, there happened a dreadful fire which originated from a chimney, and extended on both sides of the street to the distance of half a mile: the wind blowing with great violence, the flames in a few hours consumed 48 houses, being generally thatched buildings. In this conflagration 179 of the inhabitants lost their dwellings, but immediately provided themselves with lodgings within the parish, and of the number of sufferers only 24 persons went out of the parish, and returned no more. The ground vacated by the houses burnt is now, in 1780, built upon, and mostly covered with little tenements fitted for poor inhabitants to live in, and made so commodious as to receive a greater number of inhabitants than they did before the fire in 1774; so that the families, whose number in 1770 were 240, are in the year 1780 increased to 246 nearly, and perhaps will be increasing when more buildings shall be erected.

Houses pay window lights 6s. The new house tax paid by 36 houses. The first decade was published in the Phil. Transf. vol LII. part I. art. 25. The second decade was published in the Phil. Transf. vol. LXI. art. 6. p. 57. See also Dr. Price&#x27;s Observations on Reversionary Payments, ed. 1771. p. 192. and note a. also p. 259. and 263.

The taking account of the marriages in this parish cannot be of any use in political arithmetic, because it is the custom of the fixed inhabitants to go out of the parish, and be married in distant churches; and the weddings performed in this church are generally between strangers who occasionally reside here so long as to make a place of abode according to the act of
of parliament made in 1754. Dr. Heberden hath made a very proper use of the number and proportion of marriages in the island of Madeira; but then it was an island, and all are confined to their own constant residence. If the whole island of Great Britain was universally to be included in the account of the number of marriages, it would be very useful and compleat.

Many young people have gone out of this parish to supply the navy and army, but probably the same number would have emigrated, to be apprenticed and follow different occupations.

The public register is too general for the purposes of political arithmetic. The extracts here made are drawn from private papers, kept with great care and exactness, so that the births and burials of the fixed inhabitants are not rendered incorrect by the accidental ingress of foreigners, or temporary egress of the real inhabitants.</div>
