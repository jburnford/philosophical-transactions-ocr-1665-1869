<div class="ocr-text">VIII. An Account of an Experiment, concerning the Angle requir&#x27;d to suspend a Drop of Oyl of Oranges, at certain Stations, between two Glass Planes, placed in the form of a Wedge. By Mr. Fr. Hauskbee, F. R. S.

I Procured two Glass Planes that measur&#x27;d a Radius of twenty Inches each; their breadth was about 3 Inches: That which I used for the lower Plane, was plac&#x27;d with its Surface parallel with the Center of its Axis, and parallel with the Horizon. Thus (the Planes being very clean) they were rubb&#x27;d with a clean Linnen Cloth dipt in Oyl of Oranges: Then a drop or two of the same Oyl being let fall on the lower Plane near the Axis, the other Plane was laid on it; which so soon as it touch&#x27;d the Oyl, the Oyl spread itself considerably between both their Surfaces. Then the upper Plane being raised a little at the same end by a Screw, the Oyl immediately attracted itself into a Body, forming a Globule contiguous to both Surfaces, and began to move forwards toward the touching ends. When it had arriv&#x27;d two Inches from the Axis, an Elevation of 15 Minutes at the touching ends stopt its progress, and it remain&#x27;d there without Motion any way. The Planes being let fall again, the drop mov&#x27;d forward till it came to four Inches from the Center; then an Elevation of 25 Minutes was requir&#x27;d to give it a fixt Station. At 6 Inches it requir&#x27;d an Angle of 35 Minutes; at 8, of 45 Minutes; at 10, a Degree. At 12 Inches from the Axis, the Elevation was 1 Degree 45 Minutes; and so on, at the several Stations, as they stand in the following Table. This, after
abundance of tryals, I take to be the most correct, tho&#x27; the others succeeded very little different from the same. It is to be observ&#x27;d, that when the Globule, or Drop, had arriv&#x27;d to near 17 Inches on the Planes from their Axis, it would become of an Oval form; and as it ascended higher, so would its Figure become more and more oblong; and unless the Drop was small, upon such an Elevation of the Planes as was requir&#x27;d at such a progress of the Drop, it would be parted, some of it descending, and the rest of it running up to the top at once: But upon a Drop that separated thereabouts, I found the remaining part of it at 18 Inches, would bear an Angle of Elevation equal to 22 Degrees to ballance the weight of it. Higher than that I could not observe. The Planes were separated at their Axis about \( \frac{1}{6} \) of an Inch. I found but little difference between small and larger Drops of the Oyl, in relation to the Experiment. The Angles were measured by a Quadrant mark&#x27;d on Paper of near 20 Inches Radius, divided into Degrees and Quarters.
