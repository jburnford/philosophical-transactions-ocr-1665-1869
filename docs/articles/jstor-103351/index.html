<div class="ocr-text">VI. An Account of some Experiments tried with Mons. Villette&#x27;s Burning Concave, in June 1718. By the Rev. Dr. J. Harris and Dr. J. T. Desaguliers, Reg. Soc. SS.

This Miroir is a Concave 47 Inches wide, and ground to a Sphere of 76 Inches Radius; so that its Focus is about 38 Inches distant from the Vertex of the Glass. The Metal of which it is made is a Mixture of Copper, Tin and Tin-Glass, whose Reflexion has something of a yellow Cast. The Concave-Surface has scarce any Flaws, and those very small; but the Convex side, which is also polish&#x27;d, has some Holes in it.

Having held several Bodies in the Focus of this Miroir, we observ&#x27;d what happen&#x27;d to them whilst expos&#x27;d to this great Heat; and with an half second Pendulum took notice of the Time in which any material Change happen&#x27;d to them.

The Experiments were as follow, and made from Nine till Twelve in the Morning.

No. 1. A red piece of a Roman Patera, which began to melt in 3 Seconds, was ready to drop in 100.
2. Another black Piece melted at 4, and was ready to drop at 64 Seconds.
3. Chalk taken out of an Echinus Spatagus fill&#x27;d with Chalk only, fled away in 23 Seconds.
4. A Fossil-Shell calcin&#x27;d in 7 Seconds, and did no more in 64.
5. A piece of Pompey&#x27;s Pillar at Alexandria, was vitrified in the Black Part in 50 Seconds, and in the White part in 54.
6. Copper-Oar, that had no Metal in it visible, vitrified in 8 Seconds.
7. Slag, or Cinder of the ancient Iron-work said to have been wrought by the Saxons, ready to run in 29 Seconds and an half.

Here the Glass growing hot, burn&#x27;d with much less Force.

8. Iron-Oar red at first, but melted in 24 Seconds.
9. Talk began to calcine at 40 Seconds, and held in the Focus 64.
10. Calculus humanus in 2 Seconds was calcin&#x27;d, and only dropp&#x27;d off in 60.
11. An anonymous Fish&#x27;s Tooth melted in 32 Seconds and an half.
12. The Asbestos seem&#x27;d condens&#x27;d a little in 28 Seconds; but it was now something cloudy: Mons. Villette says that the Glass usually calcines it.
13. A Golden Marchasite broke to pieces, and began to melt in about 30 Seconds.
14. A Silver Sixpence melted in 7 Seconds and an half.
15. A King William&#x27;s Copper Halfpenny melted in 20 Seconds, and ran with an Hole in it in 31.
16. A King George&#x27;s Halfpenny melted in 16 Seconds, and ran in 34.
17. Tin melted in 3 Seconds.
18. Cast Iron in 16 Seconds.
19. Slate melted in 3 Seconds, had an Hole in 6.
20. Thin Tile melted in 4 Seconds, had a Hole and was vitrify&#x27;d thro&#x27; in 80.
21. Bone calcin&#x27;d in 4 Seconds, and vitrify&#x27;d in 33.
An Emerald was melted into a Substance like a Turquois Stone.
A Diamond weighing 4 Grains lost \( \frac{1}{3} \) of its Weight.</div>
