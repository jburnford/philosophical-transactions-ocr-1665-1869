<div class="ocr-text">When the Chicken are hatch&#x27;d, they put them into the lower Ovens, which are covered with Mats. Under the Mats is Bran, to dry the Chicken: and upon the Mats, Straw, for the Chicken to stand upon.

The Ground-plot of the House and Ovens is delineated according to Fig. 1. A long entrance: on each side of which are fourteen Ovens (some places have more, some less.) The bottoms and sides of those Ovens which are on the ground, are all made of Sun-dry&#x27;d Bricks; upon which they put Mats, and on the Mats the Eggs.

The top of these Ovens are flat, and covered with sticks, except two long Spaces which are made of Sun-dry&#x27;d Bricks; and are the Hearths above-mentioned, in which the fires are made, to heat the Eggs lying under them in the lower Ovens.

Above these lower Ovens are so many other, made of Sun-dry&#x27;d Bricks, and arched at the top. Where also there are some holes, which are stop&#x27;d with Tow, &amp;c. or left open, as they please to govern the heat in the Ovens below.

The Plant of the upper Oven is according to Fig. 2.

a The Mouth of the Oven, opening upon the long entrance above mentioned.

b and c Entrances into the Ovens adjoining.

d e Two Hearths three or four Inches deep, in which they make the fire, to heat this and the Oven below.

The depth of the lower Oven is about $2\frac{1}{2}$ foot English. The second, above four.

A Relation concerning Barnacles, by Sr. Robert Moray, lately one of his Majesties Council for the Kingdom of Scotland.

In the Western Islands of Scotland much of the Timber, wherewith the Common people build their Houses, is such as the West-Ocean throws upon their Shores. The most ordinary Trees are Firr and Ash. They are usually very large, and without branches, which seem rather to have been broken or worn off, than cut: and are so Weather-beaten, that there is no Bark left upon them, especially the Firs. Being in the Island of East, I saw lying upon the shore a cut of a large Firr-tree of about $2\frac{1}{2}$ foot diameter; and 9 or 10 foot long; which had lain so long out of the water, that it was very dry: And most of the Shells, that had formerly cover&#x27;d it, were worn.
worn or rubb&#x27;d off. Only on the parts that lay next the ground, there still hung multitudes of little Shells; having within them little Birds perfectly shap&#x27;d, supposed to be Barnacles.

The Shells hung very thick and close one by another, and were of different sizes. Of the colour and consistence of Muscle-Shells, and the sides or joints of them joined with such a kind of film as Muscle-Shells are; which serves them for a Hing to move upon, when they open and shut.

* See Fig. 3. * Tis thin about the edges, and about half as thick as broad. Every one of the Shells hath some cross Seams or Sutures, which, as I remember, divide it into five parts, near about the manner as in the Figure. These parts are fastened one to another, with such a film as Muscle-Shells are.

These Shells hang at the Tree by a Neck longer than the Shell. Of a kind of Filmy substance, round, and hollow, and creased, not unlike the Wind-pipe of a Chicken; spreading out broadest where it is fastened to the Tree, from which it seems to draw and convey the matter which serves for the growth and vegetation of the Shell and the little Bird within it.

This Bird in every Shell that I opened, as well the least as the biggest, I found so curiously and compleatly formed, that there appeared nothing wanting, as to the external parts, for making up a perfect Sea-Fowl: every little part appearing so distinctly, that the whole looked like a large Bird seen through a concave or diminishing Glass, colour and feature being everywhere so clear and neat. The little Bill like that of a Goose, the Eyes marked, the Head, Neck, Breast, Wings, Tail and Feet formed, the Feathers every where perfectly shap&#x27;d, and blackish colour&#x27;d; and the Feet like those of other Water-fowl, to my best remembrance. All being dead and dry, I did not look after the Inward parts of them. But having nipt off and broken a great many of them, I carried about 20 or 24 away with me. The biggest I found upon the Tree, was but about the size of the Figure here representing them. Nor did I ever see any of the little Birds alive, nor met with any body that did. Only some credible pers-
sons have assured me, they have seen some as big as their fist.

A Description of the Island Hirta; communicated also by Sr. Robert Moray.

HIRT A lies, from Snod in Skye-Island, West and by North. From the nearest Land to it in the Hercifch (from whence people ordinarily take Boat) it lies due West; and is about 50 miles from the nearest Land.

There are three Islands together, Hirta, Soa, and Burra; but Hirta only is inhabited. The other two are excellent Pasturage for Sheep: every Sheep there having two Lambs every year.

In Burra there is no landing, but to the Men of Hirta only, in regard of the difficulty thereof; there being but about a foot broad of Landing-place, and that only to be attempted when the Boat rises. For their ordinary way is, when they come near the Rock, they turn the Boat and set the side to the Shore, two men, one at each end of the Boat, with two long Poles keeping it off, that the Waves dash it not so violently against the Rock, when it rises; at which time only the Fellow, who is to land, makes his attempt. If he miss his Landing-place he falls into the Sea; and the rest of the people hale him aboard; he having before a small Rope fasten&#x27;d about his middle to prevent that danger. But when he safely lands, (which they seldom miss to do) the rest of his Fellows land one by one: except so many as they leave to attend their little Boat, which ordinarily is of six Oars.

If there be any Strangers, (as many go from the nearest Islands in Summer) they must be tied about the middle with a strong Rope; and when the men of Hirta have climb&#x27;d up to the top of the Rock (which is above twenty four Fathom, before they set their foot on grass) they hale up the Strangers to them with the Ropes. When they have gathered as many Eggs, and kill&#x27;d as many Fowls as will load their Boat; they lower all in the Boat, and the ablest Fellow is always left behind; who, having none to help him, must throw himself into the Sea, and so recover the Boat. This Burra lies from Hirta about six miles Northward.
