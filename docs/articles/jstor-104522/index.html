<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">Degree of Warmth of the Weather marked on the semicircular Arch. At (b) is a Screw thro&#x27; two Studs, to draw the great Lever backwards and forwards, as Occasion may be; (i) is a Counter-balance to the small Lever to draw the Hand back when the Brass Bar shrinks. See the Figure prefixed in the Tab.

In the Beginning of the Year 1735. I invented, and caused to be constructed, a Thermometer on the same Principles as this: I found that a Rod of Brass 3 Feet long was sensibly affected by the Changes of Heat of the Weather, having one exposed in my Garden during the hard Frost of the Winter 1739 and 40. And my Instrument was very sensible with either a Brass Rod or an Iron Rod, when the Bottom of it was placed in a Sand-Heat for chemical Uses; but I shall refer the Reader to the Appendix to the preceding No. p. 672. &amp; seq. wherein I have given, a full Description of my Invention, and the Reasons why I did not publish it before; tho&#x27; I have shewn the Instrument to Scores of People ever since May 1735. and sent a Description and Draught of it to M. Buffon, Superintendent of the Royal Physick Garden at Paris in the Year 1744. in order for his laying it before the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, from which I had some time before received a Diploma upon having the Honour of being appointed one of their Corresponding Members.
