<div class="ocr-text">Of Nutrition; the dominion of the three Humors in the Body of Animals, viz. the Gall, the Pancreatick Juice, and the Saliva, and their Mixture, either immediate or mediate, with the Blood returning to the Heart; as also their great influence, when they are vitiated, in disturbing the Effervescence of the Blood, as well as their power and vertue, when they are tempered together in a due proportion, to cause a regular motion in the blood, and to convert meat into good nourishment: Farther, about the Change of the Chyle into Blood, and where that change is begun, where advanc&#x27;d, and where perfected: About the alteration made in the whole body of Animals by the Spermatick Aura, as to their Voice, fatness, sweetness, &amp;c. About Respiration, and how that may cease for a while in Syncope&#x27;s and Hypochondriacal Suffocations without death; about Sneezing, the Hickocke, Yawning, Pandiculation, and their Causes: The alteration, which the blood of the left Ventricle receiveth in the Lungs by the inspired Air, and the Saliva, or some other glandulous liquor: Of the Pulse; of the Plenty of Animal Spirits and its cause; of the return of Feaverish fits by intervals, together with the cause thereof, &amp;c.

ERRATA.

Upon a second and more leisurable perusal of some of the former Translations, there are found left the following faults, of which some may be so material as to prejudice the sense; viz. p.641. l.12, 23, the Author of the Book, there spoken of, thinks it more suitable to the tenor of that Book, to change those words, A new method analytical for giving the Aggregat of an infinite or indefinite converging Series, into these, A new method Analytical, whereby in general he gives the termination of a converging series conditionally, and in two particular cases does the same absolutely. Compare N. 37. p.734. l.27. et seq. Besides, p. 654. l. 24. leg. MDCLVIII. p.745. l. 22. for 70 oids r. 70. Combs. p. 746. l. 24. tam aperta. p. 749. l. 6. ducatur pro dictatur p. 750. l. 9. ang lum solidum. l.20. Est quidem. p. 754. l.32. elegantis. p. 755. l. 31. ooooa85203, ——p.756. l. 1. AHGN. p. 758. l. 11. eaplan. ibid. l.20. 813b&#x27;, &amp;c. ibid. l. 23. completes. ibid.l.28. ADEJ. p.764. l.8. leg. = oLoi, numerus. p.778. l.ult. seu p.o fin. Some literal and Grammatical faults, as quadratura pro quadrat ra 3 p. 753. l. 12 homogeneorum pro homogenarium, p. 778. l.39. and such like, the Reader will be pleas&#x27;d to mend himself.
