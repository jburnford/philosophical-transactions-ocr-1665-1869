<div class="ocr-text">Extract of a Letter sent from Genoa to Sign. Sarotti, the Venetian Resident here, and by him communicated to the Honourable Mr. Boyle.

On St. Joseph&#x27;s day, upon the Mountains call&#x27;d Le Langhe, there fell upon the white Snow, that was there already, a great quantity of red, or if you please of bloody Snow. From which, being squeezed, there came a water of the same colour. Of this there are here many Eye Witnesses.

Anatomical Observations of the Structure of the Nose: made by Mons. du Vernay. Taken out of the Journal des Scavans.

An account is here given of a Book entitled, Philosophia Vetus &amp; Nova.

That the Os Cribrosum is made up of the extremities of these Lamines, which butt upon the Root of the Nose; the holes wherewith it is pierced, being the intervals between the Lamines.

They are designed to uphold the inner Tunick of the Nose. Which Tunick, being a principal Organ of Smelling, hath received from Nature a very great expansion: for the commodious placing whereof, Nature hath folded it round about together with these Lamines; that by this industrious Mechanism, she may employ all its length in a very little room.

This Tunick is fill&#x27;d with an innumerable company of small Rays; so many branches of Arteries and Veins; and especially Nerves; by which it hath a most exquisite sense. Yet because the particles of Odorant bodies are so subtil, that they can but very softly glance upon the Organ; Nature hath therefore provided by this great expansion, that there</div>
