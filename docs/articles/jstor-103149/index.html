<div class="ocr-text">V. An Extract from a Letter of Mr. Edw. Lhwyd to Dr. Tancred Robinson; giving some farther Account of the Birds mentioned in the foregoing Letter.

Oxford, Dec. 22. 1696.

The Person that gave me the Account of the Scarlet Birds, was Mr. Roberts; whom you will find mention&#x27;d in Camden, Pembrokeshire. He said they were extraordinary tame; or at least so intent upon their feeding, that being forc&#x27;d from their places, they would not remove above 2 or 3 Yards. The Cocks, he says, were of a deep Scarlet Colour, without any distinction in the Feathers of their Wings, that they could discern, excepting that the Tail and the lower part of the Belly were a little paler. The Hen had a lovely Scarlet Breast; her Head and Back grey. He is somewhat Curious in Birds; and says, he never saw any that in the least resembled them as to their Colour.

One of the other two Birds was shot, and its Skin stuffed; which probably I shall meet with this next Summer.

E. LHWYD.</div>
