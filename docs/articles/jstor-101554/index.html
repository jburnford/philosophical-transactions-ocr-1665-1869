Opticks, see that Head in the Table.

Note,

That though in this last Head there is repeated the Transfusion of Blood, because the Operation is an Art requiring diligence, and a practised hand to perform it for all advantageous Discoveries, and so to be distinguish&#x27;d from the Anatomical Account; yet that there is not affected noise and number, may well appear by reviewing and comparing the particulars of Artificial Instruments in the Table.
Table, where sometimes one Engin or Instrument may minister Aid to discover a large branch of Philosophy, as the Baroscope, an Optick Glass, &amp;c.

And very particularly M. Rook&#x27;s directions for Seamen, which specifies Instruments, may hereunto belong.

And sometimes in one of the Discourses herein mention&#x27;d, and abbreviated, there are almost as many Artificial Inventions, as Experiments; as in Mr. Boyle&#x27;s Hydrotostatical Experiments: Besides all the Chymical Operations, recited in the Treatise of the Origine of Forms, &amp;c.
