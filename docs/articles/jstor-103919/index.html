V. A Letter from John Fuller, Esq; jun. F R. S. to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. Pres. R. S. &amp;c. concerning the Effects of Dampier&#x27;s Powder, in curing the Bite of a Mad Dog.

I Imagin&#x27;d the Use of the Lychen cinereus terrestris with black Pepper, had been so infallible a Remedy for the Bite of a Mad-Dog, that there needed no Proofs of its Virtue: I myself have used it upon Dogs, and always with Success; and it is strong in my Memory, that some Years ago, a Mad-Dog or Cat (I forget which) had bit some Children and the Mother, at Battle; the Chirurgeon came over to my Brother, Dr. Rose Fuller, and we all went out in a Snow, with a Broom, and found some of it, and mix&#x27;d it as the Account of Dampier directed. They all took it, as well as a Dog or two that were bit, and none of them had any bad Effects from the Bite.
This last Christmas 1737, my next Neighbour&#x27;s Servant imprudently going to search whether a Dog suspected to be mad, had been worm&#x27;d, (which Dog died mad in three or four Days afterwards) was bit very much in both his Hands: He went to a Person near me, who has had such Success, as to be applied to far and near, and who told me he would venture his Life against a Crown Piece, if a Man, or any Animal, was brought to him within three or four Days after the Bite, that he cured him. I saw the Man that was bit every Morning, and he told me his Doctor went into the Fields, and gather&#x27;d an Herb that grew very near the Ground, like a dried Leaf, and mix&#x27;d it with Pepper. I shewed him some *Lichen cinereus terrestris*, and he said he believed it to be the same. Every Day he took his Medicine, about 10 or 11 of the Clock, he complained of a violent Heat, and Pain in his Head, which I was afraid was the Effect of the Bite, and not the Medicine: But after he had taken it for such a stated Number of Days, he grew better, and has continued well ever since.—He had tied his Fingers with Shoe-maker&#x27;s Ends, which are often used for a Cut; and they were all very much inflamed, and very sore. I made him take them off, and all his Plasters, and wash his Hands with Salt and Water, and in a Fortnight&#x27;s Time they were quite well. **If this Account should corroborate any Experiments already made, or incite the Skilful to make farther Search of the Usefulness of the Lichen, &amp;c. I hope it will excuse this Trouble from,**

SIR,

Your, &amp;c.

J. Fuller, Jun.

May 23. 1738.</div>
