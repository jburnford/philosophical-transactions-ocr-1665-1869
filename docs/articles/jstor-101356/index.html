<div class="ocr-text">A Note of Dr. Wallis sent in a Letter of Febr. 17. 1673, Upon Mr. Lister&#x27;s Observation concerning the Veins in Plants, publish&#x27;d in Numb. 90. of these Tracts.

As to the Veins of Plants, which Mr. Lister observes not to be ramified, but rather bundles of them divericate; they do in this represent the Nerves, which (as in Dr. Willis de Cerebro is observed) go together in that which seems the common trunk, like a bunch of Threads, which after separate and are variously divericated; and these Nervs, being cut, shrink up (as the Veins of Plants,) as much or more than do the Veins or Arteries of Animals.

Dr. Willis observes also, that there are two sorts of Nerves; one arising from the Cerebrum; subservient to Voluntary motions, and of which we are conscious or take notice (and which properly belong to the Functions of the Sensitive Soul, at least to the Functions of Sense;) the other, from the Cerebrum, subservient to the Involuntary motions, and of which we are not conscious or sensible, (and which belongs rather to the Functions of the Vegetative Soul, (Nutrition, &amp;c.) or at least the Intensible Locomotive faculty:) And to these latter seem reducible those Acts of Sense, which Mr. Lister speaks of in Plants. See Dr. Willis de Cerebro. c. 19. pag. 241. Edit. in 4°. and c. 15. p. 187.

A Letter of Mr. Lister dated May 21. 1673. in York, partly taking notice of the foregoing Intimations, partly communicating some Anatomical Observations and Experiments concerning the unalterable Character of the Whiteness of the Chyle within the Lacteous Veins; together with divers particulars observed in the Guts, especially several sorts of Worms found in them.

I come to your Letter, where the Analogy betwixt the Veins in Plants and the Nerves in Animals, hinted by Dr. Wallis, is a considerable notion, and I shall set myself a task e&#x27;re long to examine them both again on purpose, and to give you my thoughts. In the mean time, I will entertain</div>
