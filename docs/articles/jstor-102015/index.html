<div class="ocr-text">V. An Abstract of a Letter sent from Mr. Samuel Dale to Mr. John Houghton, S. R. S. concerning the making of Turnep-Bread in Essex.

SIR,

THE dearness of all sorts of Corn hath occasioned many poor People to set their Wits, as it were, on Tenter-hooks, and to try many ways and methods of making Bread for the Sustenance of their Families, as in some places, of Pease, and frequently of Barley: so with us they have lately got a way of making it with Turneps, which not only for the novelty thereof, but also because it may be of general use and benefit to poor, mean and indigent people, I will beg your patience until I acquaint you with the way and manner of making it, which is this: They take pilled Turneps, and boil them in Water until they are soft or tender; then pressing strongly out the Juice, they mix them, being beaten or pounded very fine and small, with their weight of Wheat-Meal. Then adding Salt q.s. and warm Water, they knead it up as other Dough, or Paste, which having lain a little while to ferment, they order it, and bake it as common Bread. Of this Turnep-Bread (for so they call it) I have both seen and tasted, and can assure you, that to the Eye it&#x27;s not to be distinguish from common Wheaten or Household Bread, neither doth the Scent much betray it, especially when cold; only to dainty and nice Palates the Turneps are a little, and but a little, perceived.

Yours

Braintree, Dec. 6.
1693.

Samuel Dale.</div>
