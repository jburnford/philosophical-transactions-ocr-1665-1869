<div class="ocr-text">I. An Extract of a Letter from Mr. Robert Vans of Kilkenny in Ireland. Dated Nov. 15, 1695, to Mr. Henry Million.

We have had of late, in the County of Limerick, and Tipperary, Showers of a sort of Matter like Butter or Grease: If one rub it upon ones Hand it will melt, but lay it by the Fire, and it dries and grows hard, having a very stinking Smell. And this last Night some fell at this place, which I did see myself this Morning. It is gathered into Pots and other Vessels, by some of the Inhabitants of this Place.

Extract from the Bishop of Cloyne&#x27;s Letter, near Youghall, April 2d. 1696.

SIR,

I think my self obliged by the Duty I owe yourself and the Royal Society, to furnish such Accounts of Natural History, as I suppose are not common. Accordingly having very diligently inquired concerning a very odd Phenomenon, which was observed in many Parts of Munster and Leinster, the best Account I can Collect thereof, is as follows: For a good part of last Winter and Spring, there fell in several places, a kind of thick Dew, which the Country People called Butter, from the Consistency and Colour of it, being soft, clammy, and of a dark Yellow; it fell always in the Night, and chiefly in Moorish low Grounds, on the
the top of the Grass, and often on the thatch of Cab-
bins: &#x27;twas seldom observ&#x27;d in the same Places twice;
it commonly lay on the Earth for near a Fortnight
without changing its Colour, but then dried and turn&#x27;d
black. Cattle fed in the Fields where it lay indifferent-
ly, as in other Fields. It fell in lumps, often as big as
the end of ones Finger, very thin and scatteringly;
it had a strong ill Scent, somewhat like the smell of
Church-yards or Graves: And indeed we had during
most of that Season very stinking Fogs, some Sedi-
ment of which might possibly occasion this stinking
Dew, tho&#x27; I will by no means pretend to offer that
a reason of it: I cannot find that it was kept long, or
that it bred any Worms or Insects; yet the superstitious
Country People, who had Scal&#x27;d or Sore Heads, rub&#x27;d
them with this Substance, and said, it healed them.

I am likewise inform&#x27;d of a Person in my Neigh-
bourhood, who had a regular Epileptic Fit, at a cer-
tain Hour every Day; I have not yet seen or discoursed
with him, but when I am furnished with a just and
faithful Account of this Case, I will not fail to Com-
municate it.</div>
