<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">LIX. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Willem Van Hazen to Mr. Philip Miller, F. R. S. concerning the Quantity of Rain, which fell at Leyden in the Year 1751.

Read Feb. 20, 1752. During the course of the last year 1751, it rain&#x27;d no less than 163 days; and the quantity of rain, which fell, was 41 inches.

LX. An Account of a double Child, communicated to the Right Honourable the Lord Willoughby, of Parham, F. R. S. by Thomas Percival Esquire.

My Lord,

Read Feb. 20, 1752. About three weeks ago was born a remarkable child at Hebus near Middleton. I presume somebody or other will send the Royal Society an account of it; but, lest that should not be soon done, be pleased to accept the inclosed, given me by a neighbouring surgeon. I have not myself seen it, being confined to my room with the gout, but am well assured it is exact, having shewn it to many, who have, and who all agree it to be right. am, my Lord,

Your Lordship&#x27;s most devoted,

Feb. 10, 1752.

Tho. Percival.</div>
