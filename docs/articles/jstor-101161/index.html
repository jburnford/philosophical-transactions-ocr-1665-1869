I. De SECRETIONE ANIMALI Cogitata, Auth. Guil.
Cole M. D. Oxon. 1674. in 12°.

Upon the consideration of the Necessity and Usefulness of knowing the manner how the Secretion of the Juyces in the body is made, both for the preservation and restoration of Health, the Ingenious Author, finding this Argument hitherto but negligently and lightly handled, undertakes in this Tract to give us his thoughts of a well-consider&#x27;d Theory concerning it: Having supposed, first, that Nature&#x27;s method is very simple, and alike in the delineation of like works; secondly, that the bodies of Animals, and so of Men, are fram&#x27;d and do work Mechanically; thirdly, that nothing is to be asserted, which is repugnant to the undoubted phenomena of Nature; nor any Uses to be assign&#x27;d either to parts or liquors, that do not correspond with the Oeconomy of the whole Body.

This done, he proceeds to the handling of the Subject itself; and here he explains first, What he means by this Secretion; next, he shews the source of these Secretions, viz. the Chyle and Blood; then, he establishes the Existence of the Nervous Juice, upon which his Hypothesis mainly depends; further, he considers the previous Disposition of the Juyces for Secretion, which he faith is induced by an intestin Fermentation; again, he assigns the Organs by nature appointed for this Office, which to him are none other but the Glandular Substances of the Body, to be found in all the parts thereof, even in the Skin itself; moreover, he expounds the manner how all animal Secretions are perform&#x27;d; which he doth first in general, teaching that generally they are all effected immediately by Percolation; then, in particular distinguishing Secretions into Simple or Perfective, and into those that are Mixt, and these again into Excretive and Reductive, he affirms the Simple or Perfective Secretions to be perform&#x27;d by meer Percolation, whereby, upon a previous mixture of the ferments convening from all parts, the texture of the Juice is so open&#x27;d, and its particles so comminuted and dissociated, that any propelling force intervening, they will easily fall afunder, and pass into vessels suitable to admit them: By which way he esteems that the trajection is made of the Chyle out
out of the Intestins into the Milky vessels, and that of the Nervous Juice out of the Arteries of the Brain into the Nerves. As to the Mixt Secretions, he will have them to perform&#x27;d by a Ferment, as that by means thereof there be impress&#x27;d such a determination on some certain particles of the Blood, that leaving behind others they readily pass into the vessels fram&#x27;d for Secretion. And here he considers, that if this kind of Separation were transacted by meer Percolation, nothing probably could hinder, but the more subtile matter would come away, and the groser stay behind: Wherefore to procure a recess of the groser parts, he calls in the help of some such Ferment, as may precipitate these into the Secretory vessels. On which occasion he discourses largely of Ferments, assigning them not only the Use of digesting and elaborating the Juices of the body, but also that of secreting them. Wherein indeed he takes pains to penetrate into the nature and properties of Ferments, minutely examining; What Bodies are qualified for Fermentation; What difference there is in Ferments; and whence the Fermentative power arises; as also the Smallness of a Ferments proportion to the Body to be fermented, and the necessity of some warmth to excite Fermentation: Explaining withal the Size and Figures of the parts of Fermenting bodies, which he teaches to be very small, very angular, and exceeding dissimilar, assigning his reason for so doing. To which he adds the two main Differences he finds in Ferments, some having an Expansive, and others a Precipitating power; and having rendered the cause from whence proceeds this difference, he affirms, that Nature makes use of the former in simple, and of the latter in mixt Secretions.

After this, he proceeds to shew, What it is that Ferments do confer to Secretion, and whence they are derived? As to the former, he affirms, that there are some Ferments, that are precedentous to Secretion, and able to loosen and subtilize the mass to be fermented, for the more easy disjunction of the parts; but that there is an other, which immediately causeth the very act of Secretion; which he takes to be the Nervous Juice, without the direction of which he esteems there will hardly be made any actual dissociation of so many different Substances, as Nature
ture requires. And this Doctrine of the Use of the Succus nervosus in the work of Secretion appearing Paradoxical, and, as he thinks, not having hitherto been taught by any, though some have long since ascribed to it a Fermentative power, and assigned to it a considerable Use in the business of Nutrition; he labors here by several reasons to evince the truth of this his new assertion. Which done, he passes on to deliver his whole Hypothesis, to shew, In what manner the Secretions in our Body are perform&#x27;d by means of this Nervous Juice.

Here then he supposeth first, That, as there is a ready passage of the blood out of the arteries into the veins upon the account of a fit position of these in reference to that motion, so there is an easy and direct way out of the orifices of the Nerves, inserted in the Glandulae, to those of the Secretory vessels: Secondly, that these vessels for Secretion are posited transversely in respect to the Sanguiferous, in such a manner that a line, drawn from one of them to the other, decussates, (though perhaps not at right angles) the place where the Capillary Arteries discharge themselves into the Capillary Veins.

This done, he conjectures, that whilst the Blood is permeating the Glandulae wherein the Secretion is to be made, the Nervous Juice runs continually out of the adjacent Nerves into the current of the Blood, and that, upon irritation, more strongly and more copiously; and the same Juice presently, nimbly, and with a sufficient impetus tracts the said current objected to it, it being both active in itself, and receiving also a more vigorous motion from the heat and agitation of the blood. And whilst this is doing, the minute particles of the Nervous liquor must needs in their way hit against those groser whereof the greatest part of the Blood consists, which, whilst they withstand the direct motion of the Succus nervosus, are by the agility of its parts propell&#x27;d, in as direct a line as may be, to the opposite side of the vessel wherein they run, forasmuch as those groser ones, being already in motion, do easily receive a determination from other particles that are moved more strongly and fall sidewayes upon them. Now the parts of the Blood being thus protruded, they do, when they meet with the orifices above-mention&#x27;d, which go into the Secretory vessels, pass into
into the same without any more ado, if they be of a size and figure suitable to them; if not, they are by the opposite side retorted into their stream, and together with it carried forward. And since there is made a continual protrusion of that Nervous liquor out of the Blood, the Brain incessantly furnishing fresh supplies, and chiefly at the time when we awake, there is thence a new and plentiful stock of such particles conveyed out of the Blood arriving at the Glanduls wherein those Nerves are inserted, and that supply is derived into the Secretory Vessels; and those particles being considerably increased, do at length make up a full stream.

This is the substance of the Hypothesis, which the Author endeavours to prove by reason, and by the phænomena of secretion, as also to free from doubts, and to vindicate from Exceptions: Where occasionally he examines that famous Question, Whether Medicaments work elective; which done, he renders a reason of the copious and sudden making of Urine after large drinking; declaring also, How it comes to pass, that one kind of Evacuation being stopt, the matter is not seldom carried off another way: treating besides at large of the Use of the Vescula bilaria, as also of private and praeter natural Secretions: Concerning all which the Author himself deserves to be consulted.

II. Erasmi Bartholini SELECTA GEOMETRICA,
Hauniæ, A. 1674. in 4°.

Although these Geometrical Tracts were printed severally divers years ago, yet they now appear again together, under a Title-page of this year; which invites us to give notice of them here, especially since formerly but few of any of the single Tracts were brought into England.

These Selecta Geometrica then, (being now to be had altogether at Mr. Martyns at the Bell in St. Paul&#x27;s Church-yard,) are;

First, a Tract handling of a General Method to come to an Equation, by reducing all sorts of Questions to general Heads: Where the Learned Author reduces to one head, for instance, all Problems of Proportionals, both Arithmetical, Geometrical, and Harmonical; but treating here only of the two latter, and more largely of the last of all. Considering Geometrical Propositions, and observing the desiderata in solving Problems concerning the same; he propounds a Method, whereby the Solution of
such may be found very compendiously (as he faith) and with far greater dispatch, than hath been done by some others, especially the Author of the Clavis Geometricæ. The like he undertakes to do, and that more largely, of Harmonical Proportions, concerning which he gives us the Demonstration of Ten Problems of that kind, whose Truth he had found out by the Method of the Analysis speciosa, thereby to shew to the Intelligent, how great a difference there is between these two ways, for shortness, perspicuity, pleasantness, and ease to the memory. In this piece also the Author makes mention of divers things about the Construction of Equations, left imperfect by Florimundus de Beaune, which he (our Author) promised to publish with the Tract that is abroad, and known by the Title of the Second Part of Des-Cartes&#x27;s Geometry; in which indeed he treats de Natura &amp; Constitutione Equationum, &amp; de Limitibus, but nothing of the Geometrical Constructions, either his own or those that remained imperfect of the said De Beaune, mention&#x27;d to be in his (our Authors) custody. So much of the first Tract.

The second is his Divisio; in which having taken notice, how short the Antient Geometricians came of a General Art of Determining Problems, he faith, he hath endeavour&#x27;d to supply that defect, by delivering here two General Rules of Determining the Limits of Equations, so as to know, how many Roots are possible: in the first of which he follows the Rule of that famous Geometrician Fermat: In the second, he agrees with the Method of the Learn&#x27;d Huddenius; to be met with in the Annexa to the first Part of Des-Cartes&#x27;s Geometry; which seems indeed to be a Corollary of the Excellent Slufius his General Method of Tangents, publish&#x27;d in No. 90. of these Tracts. At the end of this piece the Author promiseth his Systema Mathecos Universalis, where he would have the Reader expect a large account of all things belonging to the Analysis speciosa, both as to Precepts and Examples: Which promise &#x27;tis hoped will be made good by him ere long.

The third is an Auctarium Trigonometricæ, to solve and demonstrate Triangles both Rectilinear and Spherical; deliver&#x27;d in XIII. Propositions, of which he shews the last of all to be of great Use in Tables Astronomical composed after the manner of the Rudolphin made by Kepler, where the Distance of the Sun from the Earth, as also from any other Planet, is express&#x27;d in Logarithmes.
garithmes. For, to find the Prosthaphærisis of the Orb, he there teaches, that you are to resolve a Triangulum simile. But now, though the Logarithmes of the sides of a Triangle be given, yet there is not given the ratio of the Summ of the sides to their Difference; which is made known by the said 13th Problem, here demonstrated.

III. LOGICA, sive ARS COGITANDI, è Tertia apud Gallos Editione recognita &amp; aucta, in Latinum versa, Londini imperfis Joh. Martyn, sub signo Campanæ in D. Pauli Cæmeterio, 1674. in 8°.

This Logick, being now turned into good Latin, seems worthy to be recommended to all young Students, as passing by, what is useless and pedantique, and comprehending what is indeed sober, and necessary to direct our Reason in all sorts of ingenious and useful Sciences.

It considers chiefly, what the Causes are, from whence so many Errors take rise, and how it comes to pass that we are so far misled in the investigation of Truth.

It regulates our first Apprehension of things; it confines our Judgment and Discourse to what is clearly and distinctly understood; and it orders the Mind to dispose its Ideas and Ratiocinations in such a Method, as is most suitable and proper for the Explication of any Subject under consideration.

Moreover it endeavours to shew, that the Ten Aristotelian Predicaments, which the Schools hitherto have born themselves so much upon, are so far from being of that use they lay claim to, that very often they are an obstacle to the attainment of solid knowledge; which the Author Attempts to evince; i. Because that those Predicaments are recommended to Scholars as founded in reason &amp; truth itself, whereas nothing is more arbitrary than they are, as proceeding from the imagination of some one Man, who had no right at all to prescribe Laws to the Philosophical World; others having no less power than He to use their right in disposing the Objects of their thoughts in such order as suits best with the Model of Philosophy which they embrace; upon which account very many of those that dissent from Aristotle find more cause to adhere to the import of these two Lines;

Mens, Mensura, Quies, Motus, Positura, Figura.

Sunt, cum Materia, cunctarum Exordia rerum:

They being fully persuaded, that the Seven Heads, herein con-
tained, have a real foundation in Nature, and do altogether exhaust the same. 2. Because that this applauded Series of Predicaments induces many men to take up, and acquiesce in the empty Shells and Barks of Words, instead of sincere and good Fruit, they caring for little else so they can but reckon up some fine Words of an arbitrary signification, that do not imprint any clear and distinct idea in the Mind.

Further, this Logick delivers not bare Rules with trivial and nauseous Examples, but having laid down solid Precepts, it presently transfers them to very good Use, and accommodates the same to very Instructive and Delightful Examples, taken out of all sorts of real Sciences, whereby they are to fasten&#x27;d in the Memory, that there they stick even after the Students have laid aside Books of Logick: So that here may be found both Rules of good Logick, and the Uses of those Rules; which must needs have this excellent Effect, that by the help of such a Logick as this, ingenious Scholars will be enabled to Judge of Sciences; and the Sciences, by way of recompence, will fix Logick the deeper in their understanding.

Upon occasion, notice is taken by our Author of what is considerable in Aristotle&#x27;s Logick, and what other Writings of his are valuable; from which number he scruples not to exclude his Physicks, boldly affirming, that they partly teach what&#x27;s false, partly nothing but what we can not be ignorant of. Where he also declares in general, that since we owe no deference to any Philosophers, but either upon the account of Truth they have endeavour&#x27;d to discover, or upon consideration of the esteem they have gain&#x27;d in the Learn&#x27;d Orb, we cannot be obliged further to venerate Aristotle than he hath attained Truth, nor pay him honor for the Tenets delivered by him and his followers, more than to any other part of the Learn&#x27;d World that labor in the search of Truth, and find solace to silent from Him.

When our Author comes to treat of Ratiocination, he advises his Reader to consider; Whether he ought to set so much by the Forms of Syllogizing as hath been done hitherto; and Whether most Errors that entangle men, do not spring from thence, that they build their Discourses upon false Principles, rather than they deduce illegitimate consequences from true Principles; it hapning but seldom, that we are imposed upon by such a Ratiocination as is therefore only unsound, because &#x27;tis made
made up of ill-drawn Consequences, and it being also certain, that he that is not able to discover such vices by the sole Light of nature, will neither be able to learn and apply those Rules that are taught to detect them.

Proceeding to deliver the Rules of true Method, he first recommends the four celebrated ones left by Des-Cartes in his Dissertation de Methodo, as very useful to avoid Error in the acquisition of Sciences, and then he represents with an high encomium the way used by Geometricians for Demonstration, comprised in these five Rules:

1. Nihil in terminis obfcurorum &amp; equivocorum relinquere, quod non definiatur.
2. In definitionibus terminos utiurare vel perfecte nectes, vel prius explicatos.
3. Nullum axiomata ponere quod non sit evidentissimum.
4. Omnes Propositiones sub-obscuras probare ope Definitionum præmissarum, Axiomatum concordantium, Propositionum demonstratarum, vel denique ipsa rei, de qua agitur, Consideratione, ubi quid accidat, non proponitur.
5. Nunquam ab aliis terminis rerum cognitatis, non sufficiens, saltem mentaliter, Definitionibus, quae illas figurant &amp; explicant.

Yet to this Method he joins an Advertisement concerning some Defects that are obvious even in that Method or Geometricians; of which he enumerates the six: 1. Magis laborare de Certitudine quam Ecidentia, deque Intellecuto convincendo quam in minando. 2. Ea probare que probatio non egent. 3. Demonstrare per impossibile, h.e. non per propriari principia, sed per aliquid, si res aliter se haberet, inde secuturum absurdum. 4. Demonstrare per aliena &amp; remota. 5. Nonobservare rerum ordinum. 6. Non adhibere divisiones &amp; partitiones. All which how&#x27;tis made out by Instances, may appear in the book itself.

Some Anomalies upon the Latin Version, made by C.S. of the Phil. Transactions of A.1665.1666.1667.1668, printed at Amsterdam by Henry and Theodore Boom: Which reflexions since they chiefly concern Foreigners, it was thought most proper to give them here in Latin.
