MDCLXXVIII.
The Eggs are first put upon Mats in the lower Ovens, which are upon the ground; seven or eight Thousand Eggs in number; and laid only double one upon another.

In the Ovens above these lower, the Fire is made in long Hearths or little Channels, having some depth to receive the Fire: from whence the heat is conveyed into the lower Ovens before mentioned. The Eggs which are directly under these Hearths, lie treble one upon another; the rest, as was said, only double.

At Night, when they new-make the Fires in the Hearths above-mention&#x27;d; they then remove the Eggs that were directly undermost (lying three one upon another) in the place of those which lay on the sides only double: and these being now removed, they lay treble under the Hearth, because the heat is greater there, than on the sides where the Eggs are only double.

These Eggs continue in the lower Ovens fourteen days and nights: Afterwards they remove them into the upper Ovens; which are just over the lower. In these (there being now no more Fire used) they turn all the Eggs four times every day; i.e. in every 24 hours.

The 21 or 22 day the Chicken are hatch&#x27;d: which the first day eat not; the second, they are fetch&#x27;d away by Women, who give them Corn, &amp;c.

The Master of the Ovens hath a third part of the Eggs for his cost and pains: out of which, he is to make such good unto the Owners (who have two thirds in Chicken for their Eggs) if any happen to be spoiled or miscarry.

The Fire in the upper Ovens, when the Eggs are placed in the lower, is thus proportion&#x27;d:

The first day, the greatest Fire. The second, less than the first. The third, less. The fourth, more than the third. The fifth, less. The sixth, more than the fifth. The seventh, less. The eighth, more. The ninth, without fire. The tenth, a little fire in the Morning. The eleventh, they shut all the holes with Flax, &amp;c. making no more fire; for if they should, the Eggs would break.

They take care, that the Eggs be no hotter than the Eye of a man, when they are laid upon it, can well endure.

B.

Barbados; some curious gleanings, after Ligon&#x27;s history of it, by Dr. Th. Towns, viz. That every House, with Sugar-works and out-houses, looks like a handsome Town; the whole Island like a scatter&#x27;d City, which with perpetual green Fields and green Woods make the prospect very pleasant; most houses now built with stone, and cover&#x27;d with slate; the soil very fertile, though not above one or two foot deep, upon a white and spungie Lime-stone rock, which in some places yields good quarries for buildings; the springs all near the sea; in the higher countries they make ponds to receive rain, which serve the better, being kept cool by broad-leav&#x27;d weeds, and duck-weed which overgrow the Ponds; and now almost every Sugar-plantation hath a Well which gives very good water; their only Wine in esteem is from the Madera&#x27;s, which (contrary to other Wines) will not endure a cool Cellar; the Air most pleasant, neither too cold by night, as formerly, nor too hot by day: On the tops of mountains, and in cool and shady places, some of our European Plants are found: The Blood of Negro&#x27;s is black, which seems to be the cause of their black skin, &amp;c. n. 117. p. 399.
