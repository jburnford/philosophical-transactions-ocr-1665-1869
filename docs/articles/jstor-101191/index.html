<div class="ocr-text">tries above-mention&#x27;d; and rest perswaded, that all possible endeavours shall be employed on our parts, to recommend all what shall thus be proposed by them, to our Correspondents, with the same earnestness we do our own Directions, suggested by several of our Curious Friends.

Inquiries for Suratte,
and other parts of the East-Indies,

Though these Queries have been already dispatcht for India, and some of them even received an Answer, yet, because &#x27;tis altogether necessary, to have confirmations of the truth of these things from several hands, before they be relied on, it was thought fit, rather to publish the Inquiries alone, for a more certain and full Information, than now to join such Answers thereunto:

The Inquiries are these; as the Relations publisht by Purchas, Linschoten, and others, concerning those parts, have given occasion to propose them.

1. Whether it be true, that Diamonds and other Precious Stones, do grow again after three or four years, in the same places where they have been digg&#x27;d out?

2. Whether the Quarries of Stone near Fettipore, not far from Agra, in the Mogol&#x27;s Dominions, may be cleft like Loggs, and fawn like Planks, to cel Chamber and cover Houses therewith? Likewise, Whether about Sadrapatam, on the Coast of Coromandel, there be a Stone of the like nature, so as, setting a Wedge upon it, one may cleave it with a Mallet as thick and as thin, as one pleaseth?

3. Whether upon the same Coast of Coromandel, about Tutu-sorin, and upon that of Ceylon, at Manar, and Safanapatan, they fish Pearls, as good as those about Ormus? Whether those Pearls are the better, the deeper they lie? What is the greatest depth, they are known to have been taken at? And whether it be true, that some of the Natives there, can stay under Water half an hour, without any Art?

4. Whether the Iron in Pegu and Japan, be far better than ours; and if so, what is to be observed in the melting, forging, and tempering of it?

5. Whether
5. Whether in Sumatra there be a fountain, running a very
Sanative Oyl: And whether the ignivomous Mountain in the
same Island, do burn continually, and cast out stones so eaten
out by the fire, that they swim?

6. What is the Opinion of the more Inquisitive Men in those
parts, of Amber-gris? And whether the greatest quantities and
masses of it are found about the Isle Mauritius?

7. Whether it be Winter on the East-side of the Mountain
Gates, which comes from the North to Cape Comorin, while it
is Summer on the West-side, and so, vice versa?

8. Whether it be true, that upon the Coast of Coromandel,
16 deg. Northern Latitude, between Paleacote and Malacopatan,
50 Leagues in length (the hot winds blowing from the Land-ward
from 8. in the Morning, till 4. in the Afternoon, with such a suf-
focating heat, that the Inhabitants are not able to endure it, with-
out extraordinary helps and refreshments;) every one daily for his
provision of drink, hangs his Bottle, made of common pot-earth,
and filled with Well-water, or other potable Liquor, upon some
Post, Tree, or Wall, in places, where the Sun and Wind are most
piercing; leaving it there all the day long in the scorching heat;
and then taking it up about Evening at 4. of the Clock, the
Drink is more cool, than any depth of Cellerage with us can make
it? And whether, on the contrary, the Bottles being suffered to
continue in the Air, as before, during the cool Sea-gales, which
come in after the said hour, and continue all Night, till 8. in the
Morning, to the refreshment of all Creatures, the Liquors grow
hot and unfit for drink?

9. Whether the Tyde near Mindanao, going from the Molucca&#x27;s
to the Philippina&#x27;s, are so swift, that neither contrary Winds nor
Anchors, can save a Ship from being carried away by it; and that
it rises but about 3. or 4. feet? And whether the like be obser-
ved in the Bay of Cambaja, and in that between Martaban and
Pegu? And particularly, Whether in the said Bayes, the Tides
come in with that impetuosity and swiftness about the Quarters
of the Moon, that the Watch-men from high Towers must with
their Trumpets give warning to the people to retire; and that a
Horse in his swiftest course, when such a Tide comes upon him,
cannot out-run it: as Isaac Vossius observes, Lib. De Motu
Marium
And what other particulars are observable upon all those Coasts, concerning the Tides?

10. Whether there be any Discoveries newer, than the newest printed Maps, of the parts of the World North-east of Japan? And whether Japan be truly an Island, or no?

11. What is the true way of making and colouring China-Dishes; and how in China and Japan, they make the Black-vernish?

12. With what Materials, and how they paint both upon Cloths, commonly call&#x27;d Pintado&#x27;s, and likewise upon Canvas, &amp;c?

13. Whether the Lignum Aloe be the Wood, or Root of a Tree? In what Countrey it is found? And how to know the best of the kind?

14. Whether the best Tea be that, which comes forth at the first of the Spring, and are the Top-leaves? In what manner &#x27;tis dried; and whether the too hasty drying thereof hurts it?

15. Whether there grows a Wood in Java, that naturally smells like humane Excrement? And if so, what kind of ground it grows in?

16. Whether in the Molucque Islands there be a Red Wood, which burns, sparkles, and flames, without being consumed; yet may be reduced to powder, by rubbing between ones fingers?

19. Whether it be true, that the onely Antidote hitherto known, against the famous and fatal Macassar-poyson, is humane Ordure, taken inwardly? And what substance that poyson is made of?

20. Whether there be such a Vegetable in Java, call&#x27;d Mangas bravas, that is so poisonous, that it kills presently, and for which no remedy hath been yet found?

21. Where the best Calamba-wood, or Palo d&#x27;Aquila, grows? Whether the Palo d&#x27;Aquila be much inferior to Calamba; and how
how they are distinguished? Whether the latter be the Pith of the former? Whence the best sort comes? Whether it be stored with a rich and cordial Balm, and that be the cause of its great rate, being much used in cases of decay of Spirits, and the lameness and impotency of Nerves?

22. Whether they draw an Oyl, resembling Oyl of Camphire, from the Roots of Cinnamon-trees; and if so, how they draw it?

23. Whether the Camphire of Borneo be not the Exsudation or Gum of a Tree?

24. Whether the Indians can so prepare that stupifying Herb, call&#x27;d Dutrea or Datura, that they make it lie several Dayes, Months, and Years, according as they design it, in a Mans Body, without doing him any hurt, and at the end kill him, without missing an hours time?

25. Whether the Betel hath such a contrariety to the Durion, that a few leaves of that, put to a whole Shop-full of Durions, will make them all rot suddenly? And whether those, that have surfeited on Durions, and thereby over-heated themselves, do by laying a leaf or two of Betel upon their Breasts or Stomachs, immediately cure the Inflammations, and recover?

26. Whether the Papayas, which bear fruit like a Melon, do not bear, unless Male and Female (as the Vulgar distinguishes them) stand together?

27. Whether there be two sorts of the Tree, call&#x27;d Arbor Triflè, one, by the Name of Trifè di Die, the other, Trifè di Notte; whereof the former sheds his flowers at the Rising, the other, at the Setting of the Sun? And whether the distilled water thereof (call&#x27;d Aqua di Mogli, by the Portugals) may not be transported into these parts?

28. Whether one of those Trees, call&#x27;d Arbre de Rays, propagates itself into a whole Forrest, by shooting up, and letting fall Roots from all its branches into the ground, that spring up again, and so on? And whether there be any single ones of these Trees, that are above 50 feet in Diameter, as some affirm?

29. What particulars are observable in any other Plants of those parts?
30. Whether those Shell-fishes, that are in these parts plump and in season at the Full Moon, and lean and out of season at the New, are found to have contrary Constitutions in the East-Indies?

31. Whether the Animal, that yields the true Muske, be like a Deer, hornless, found in the High-Country between Pegu and China? And whether the Muske grows in Baggs, Blisters, or Swellings, which the Beast rubs off against Trees; it being affirmed to have been found in the Woods by the Scent? Whether true Muske, is discerned from false by its yellowness, when rubbed upon ones hand, and by its keeping that Colour and the Scent?

Other Queries, concerning the Air, Waters, Minerals, Vegetables, Animals, &amp;c. peculiar to Persia, may be taken out of those General Heads of Inquiries, for a Natural History of a Country, printed in Numb. II. and out of those Articles of Inquiries concerning Mines, publish&#x27;d in Numb. 19. to which we refer the Reader.
