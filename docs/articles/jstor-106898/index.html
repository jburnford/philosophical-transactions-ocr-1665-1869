The winter was in general an open one; about a week&#x27;s frost at the beginning of the year, the rains less than they had been, yet at times enough to keep it very dirty. The latter end of January, and the month of February were mild and fine, and the birds singing, but it was windy at times, and more so in March, which was a very uncertain month, being alternately windy, fine, wet, and at the end frosty; and the first of April there came a great snow, the only considerable one this winter, and was followed by floods for several days together, and a very backening season. This great snow and wet coming after a good deal of the spring corn was sown, was a damage to the crops; and the three following months being very dry, and just in the long days, the ground cracked and burnt very much, and many of the spring crops were very small, both for hay, straw, and corn; the wheat crop was the best, and that was pretty good.

The former part of the summer was cool, and sometimes cold, frequent frosty mornings, even into June; but July was hot and burning, and the fortnight from July 5 to 18 was uncommonly so; nine days out of twelve the thermometer was up to or above 80, and one day it was 89; this I think I never knew before, either for height or continuance, unless it was so in that hottest of summers 1750. This hot dry time hindered the sowing or coming up of turnips, which were late and dear this year. The hay, except on some moist meadows, was very light, but well gotten, as was also all the grain, but very dear, especially the spring corn.

This summer was complained of as dry, but it was so only the three months May, June, and July; there was only the quantity of one month&#x27;s rain in those three months, and that
being just in the long days, in the high strong sun, and when all the crops should be in their greatest growth, they were much hurt by it, and perhaps the more so for having been before oversoaked with snow and wet. The latter part of the summer was very fine, rain enough to make the grass grow, and fine enough to get the crops in well; great eddishes, and more grass than there had been in any part of the summer before. And when in September and November there came two wet months, the cracks and dryness of the ground underneath carried it all clear off. The autumn also was remarkably fine, calm, mild, and almost without frost, so that the grass continued green till Christmas, which was very useful to the farmers, as it saved their fodder very much, which was very scarce.</div>
