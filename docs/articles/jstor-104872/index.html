The Reader is desired to correct the Title of the XIIth Paper of the last Number of these Transactions in the following manner:

A Letter from Richard Brocklesby M. D. and F.R.S. to the President, concerning the Indian Poison, sent over by Don Antonio De Ullöa of Seville, F. R. S. and mentioned by M. de la Condamine, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, in his late Account of the River of the Amazons in South America.

He is also desired in the same Paper, to read towards the Bottom of the first Page, instead of Mr. Juan Antonio de Loa, Don Antonio de Ulloa. This Gentleman was one of those sent by the King of Spain to attend and assist the French Astronomers of the Royal Academy of Sciences, in their late Measure of a Degree of Latitude near the Equator. He was taken Prisoner at Cape Breton in his Return home, and brought into England, where his Papers all relating to the Measure of the Degree, and other Astronomical and Philosophical Observations, were by the Favour of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty restored to him, to be published in his own Country. An Abstract of the same was however by their Lordship&#x27;s Leave communicated to the Royal Society, by their President, who was entrusted with the Perusal of the same: And the Author himself, who is a Gentleman of great Merit, was soon after unanimously chosen a Fellow of the Society. Some time after his Return he procured the above-mentioned Specimen of this Indian Poison, which he sent over together, with some Books, as a Present to his Friend the President of the Society.</div>
