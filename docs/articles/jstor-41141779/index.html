<div class="ocr-text">III. *Magnetical Observations at Port Bowen, &amp;c.* A.D. 1824-25,
comprehending observations on the diurnal variation and
diurnal intensity of the horizontal needle; also on the Dip of
the magnetic needle at Woolwich, and at different stations,
within the Arctic circle. By Captain W. E. Parry, F.R.S.
and Lieutenant Henry Foster, F.R.S.

The daily variation of the horizontal needle was first ob-
served in London by Mr. Graham, in the year 1722; but
in consequence of its small amount, it has always been con-
sidered amongst the minor phenomena which the magnetic
needle presents. Mr. Barlow, however, having explained
a method of increasing the amount of this daily change very
considerably, in any latitude,* this phenomenon began to as-
sume a different character, and seemed to furnish a subject
of highly interesting, if not of useful, enquiry.

Therefore, soon after our arrival at Port Bowen, an attempt
was made to obtain the diurnal variation of the magnetic
needle at this place, with an instrument constructed by Mr.
Dollond for that purpose, and which had been used at the
Whale Fish Islands. But the weight of the needle occasioned
so much friction on the point of support, that no movement
could be detected; and after several trials, which it is un-
necessary here to detail, (and in the course of which it was
discovered that the brass composing the instrument was in
every part highly magnetic) it was wholly laid aside as use-
less in these latitudes.

* Phil. Trans. for 1823.

MDCCCXXVI. * L
The needles, distinguished by Nos. 1 and 2 in the following tables were suspended, instead of supported, and were contained within a small wooden box having a glass cover. The centre of each was made exactly to coincide with the centre of motion of the index of a common Hadley&#x27;s quadrant, graduated to minutes as usual, the box being fixed upon the index and moving with it. The agate cup of each needle was just allowed to touch a fine steel point of support, in order to preserve their correct centres. No. 1 needle belonged to an azimuth compass on Capt. Kater&#x27;s construction, its lozenge shape being that figured in the Appendix to the Voyage of 1819-20, p. cix; except that this needle was rounded at the corners forming the extremities of its transverse diameter. Its weight (with the addition of mica ends increasing its length to eight inches for the purpose of more accurate observation) was 104 grains, that of the needle alone being 50 grains.

No. 2 needle was formed of clock spring, and furnished by Mr. Christie, for some experiments to be made with it under the influence of magnets. Its shape has been already described by that gentleman in his paper on this subject, in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1823.

The length of this needle was 4.9 inches, but increased by mica ends to about ten inches, in which state it weighed 96 grains, that of the needle alone being 51 grains.

Both these needles were delicately suspended by a few fine threads of floss silk, from seven to eight inches in length, having no torsion, and passing up through a copper cylinder over a small brass pulley. A leaden weight just equivalent to that of the needle was then attached to the
other end of the silk, in order to adjust it so that it might barely touch the centre or point of support.

No. 3 needle, which was that of a common ship&#x27;s azimuth compass, and weighed 146 grains, was suspended like the other two, but simply contained within an air-tight box having glass ends. A sight of card paper being fixed towards each extremity of the needle, the amount of variation was obtained, by observing the coincidence of the sights through a small telescope traversing upon an arc of ten feet radius, and consequently placed at that distance from the needle. A vernier attached to the telescope, and moving with it, gave the reading to the nearest minute. This needle was afterwards used exclusively for obtaining the changes in the magnetic intensity, for which it was found remarkably well adapted; the instant of the coincidence of the two sights being easily observable through the telescope to two-tenths of a second, by means of a chronometer held to the ear. During the absence of daylight, these observations were made by candlelight, transmitted through a sheet of oiled paper, fixed against the glass end of the box, farthest from the observer.

The observations were made at the commencement by Lieutenant Foster and Captain Parry, but were subsequently carried on in regular watches, and the needles visited every hour during four successive months, by Lieutenants Sherer and Ross, and Messieurs Crozier, Richards and Head. When any extraordinary change, however, appeared to be going on, the needles were more closely watched; and every phenomenon, such as the aurora borealis, meteors, clouds, the kind and degree of light, the moon&#x27;s position, and the temperature within and without, were at all times care-
fully noted. In the following tables these phenomena, with the exception of the temperature, have necessarily been omitted, on account of the great length to which their insertion would have extended this communication; but an abstract of all the particulars relative to one of the needles, No. 2, has been made by Lieutenant Foster, and is given in continuation of this series; diagrams exhibiting graphically the various deflections of needle No. 1, for which we are indebted to the ingenuity of Mr. Hooper, are also subjoined.

The original register of the whole is preserved and can easily be referred to, should any of the observed phenomena, beyond those which are here given, be considered likely to have influenced the motion of the needles. As far, however, as our own observations extended, we have reason to believe that on no occasion were the needles in the slightest degree affected, either by the aurora, meteors, or any other perceptible atmospheric phenomenon.

Soon after the observations were commenced, it was ascertained that twice in every four and twenty hours the needles moved past a certain point, which may be denominated the zero, or mean magnetic meridian; a fact, which was first rendered clearly apparent, from the accompanying diagrams already mentioned, by which it appears that in every instance except one, both needles every day passed the line in question. On a single day, February 24, the needle No. 2 did not arrive at it during its eastern motion.

The means of the times of the needle passing this zero, as deduced from four months continued observations, is, $6^h\ 15^m$ A. M., and $4^h\ 37^m$ P. M.; the mean time in each month being as follows:
magnetical observations at Port Bowen, &amp;c.

| Year | A. M. | P. M. |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1825 |       |       |
| January | 6h 00m | 4h 00m |
| February | 6 30 | 4 00 |
| March | 5 30 | 5 00 |
| April | 7 00 | 5 30 |

Mean 6 15 4 37

To avoid the insertion of many useless figures in the tables, the resulting amount of easterly or westerly deflection on each side of the zero has been computed.

The maximum westerly variation at Port Bowen appears, from these observations, generally to have occurred between the hours of 10h A. M. and 1h P. M., the mean result of one hundred and twenty days&#x27; observations being 11h 49m A. M. The minimum westerly variation, or the greatest deflection of the north end of the needle to the eastward, took place between 8h P. M. and 2h A. M., the mean time, deduced as above, being 10h 1m P. M.

In a few instances the maximum deflection of the needle to the westward occurred as early as 8h A. M., and as late as 9h P. M.; and in like manner, the greatest deflection eastward took place at 2h and 3h P. M., on some few occasions. In all these anomalous cases, however, it was remarked, from simultaneous observations on the times of vibration of a suspended horizontal needle, that these irregularities were evidently due to an extraordinary alteration in its intensity, which produced a deflection contrary to the regular order of the motion of the needle.

The diurnal change of direction appears, by these observations, to have been seldom less than one degree, and sometimes to have amounted to 5, 6, and even 7 degrees, and there can be no doubt that the changes in this amount were
more or less due to the position or influence of the sun, and probably of the moon, on the terrestrial magnetic sphere; but the particular laws of this influence is a question of great delicacy, and of intricate research, and will be best left to the investigations of those who are theoretically conversant with these subjects.

Note. The registered temperatures, throughout these observations, are according to Fahrenheit&#x27;s scale, and are all below zero, in those columns that have the sign minus (—) only, placed at the top, and above zero in those that have the sign plus (+) inserted in like manner. Those columns, however, at the top of which, these signs appear thus, (±) contain observations, both below, and above zero, which are pointed out, by their respective signs, being prefixed to the several observations of each denomination.
