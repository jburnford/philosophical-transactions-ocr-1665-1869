Read Feb. 25, 1762.

These observations were taken with a refracting telescope of 19 Paris feet focal length, with an eyeglass of 3 inches focus.

The least distance of the southern limb of Venus from the nearest limb of the sun, was measured by a micrometer fitted to a 10 feet telescope, and found to be = 6&#x27; 2&#x27;&#x27;, and the sun&#x27;s diameter was = 31&#x27; 37&#x27;&#x27;.</div>
