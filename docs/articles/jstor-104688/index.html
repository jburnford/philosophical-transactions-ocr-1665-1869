XXI. A Letter from John Burton M. D. to C. Mortimer M.D. &amp; Secr. R. S. concerning the Extirpation of an Excrecence from the Womb.

SIR,

Read July 5. I HAVE at last got a Drawing of an Excrecence * growing from the Inside of the Os Tinea on the right Side; which I herewith send you, (see Tab. I. Fig. 6.) along with as full and perfect an Account of the Case as I can.

The Wife of one Chapman, a Whitesmith, at Selby, ten Miles off, upwards of seven Years ago lay in of her last Child, and had a tolerable easy Labour: Soon after which, she had what she called the Fluor albus, that continued ever since, and increased upon her; insomuch that she says, she has sometimes

* It is exactly the Dimensions of the Original, which weighed 5 Ounces and a half. That Part below the pricked Line appeared out of the Vagina; that above reach&#x27;d from the Labia to the Os Uteri.
sometimes had such a Discharge, as to wet the Place she sat upon thro&#x27; all her Petticoats, &amp;c.

For some Months before we were concerned for her, she began to complain of a Pain and Weight in the Uterus; which increased as the Substance grew in Bulk; and at last the Excrecence was so large as to appear outwards, and then it grew very fast.

The Patient consulted her Midwife, who thought the Womb had come out; but was so prudent as not to do any thing; and desired they would call in better Advice. Accordingly they sent for Mr. Fell, an eminent Man-midwife and Surgeon in this City; who, not having met with a Case like that, desir&#x27;d me also to go and see her; which was in December last (1749). The Substance not only fill&#x27;d, but extended, the Entrance into the Vagina. I introduced a Finger into the Passage, and soon found the Excrecence to be less in Bulk there than what appear&#x27;d without the Body; and to be in Shape as you see in the Drawing. I follow&#x27;d the Substance till I reach&#x27;d the Os Uteri, which I found chiefly fill&#x27;d up, with the Neck or smallest Part of this Substance, leaving only a small Part of the Os Tincæ to be perceived on the left Side, obliquely towards the Back. I tried to penetrate the Os Tincæ with the End of my Finger, but could not; however, I so far open&#x27;d it, as to let out a sort of bloody Ichor, which was a little offensive in Smell.

I asked her, if, when her Discharges were so large as to wet her Seat, they differ&#x27;d in Smell from those which came in less Quantities; and if they smelled something like what then came from her when I searched her, which she answer&#x27;d in the Affirmative: From whence I concluded she had an Ulcer
cer just within the Os Uteri, from the Edge of which this Fungus or Excrecence grew. The Patient complain&#x27;d of Pain in the Uterus and Back, was very faint, and frequently was provoked to vomit, with a feeble Pulse, and sometimes Sweat.

Upon Consultation, we thought proper to tie a Ligature as high up within the Vagina as the Surgeon could reach: Which being done, and some internal Medicines being order&#x27;d, we return&#x27;d home; and in two or three Days we went again, but found no great Alteration as to the uterine Complaint; except that the Part below the Ligature was somewhat more livid, and the fetid Smell was much greater, and very like that of a confirmed running Cancer: And as the Matter was somewhat confin&#x27;d in the Passage, I order&#x27;d them to wash the Vagina by an Injection made of the common emollient Decoction, with Mel Rosarum and a little Tinct. Myrrha. This was frequently done; by which the Smell was less offensive; and two Days after the Excrecence dropp&#x27;d off at the Ligature.

The Patient has since, in part, recover&#x27;d her Strength; tho&#x27; she is not in a good State of Health, and her Fluor albus, as she calls it, is still troublesome to her.

This was the last Account I have had of her. The Excrecence was very solid, of a dark liver Colour, and, whilst adhering to the Uterus, was quite insensible. When cut in two, it resembled the solid Substance that is taken out of Cancers. I am,

SIR,

York, March 28,
1750.

Your very humble Servant,

John Burton.
