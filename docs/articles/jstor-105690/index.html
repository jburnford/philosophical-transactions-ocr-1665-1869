Read Jan. 13, 1763.

According to Mr. Short, the mean horizontal parallax of the Sun is $8&#x27;&#x27;$, $65$.

Now this parallax is the angle, which the semidiameter of the earth subtends, being seen from the Sun.

Therefore as $8&#x27;&#x27;$, $65$, is to $360^\circ$ (the whole periphery of a circle) so is the semidiameter of the earth to the periphery of the orbit of the earth round the Sun.
Sun. But $8&#x27;&#x27;$, $65$, is very nearly $\frac{1}{360}$th part of $360^\circ$, as may be easily proved by division.

According to the latest observations, the mean semidiameter of the earth is $3958$ English miles, which being multiplied by $149,826$ produces $593,011,308$ miles for the circumference of the orbit of the earth.

The distance of the earth from the Sun is the semidiameter of this orbit: and the periphery of the circle is to its semidiameter very nearly as $6,283,185$ to one.

Therefore if we divide $593,011,308$ by $6,283,185$ the quotient, which is very nearly $94,380,685$, will give the mean distance of the earth from the Sun in English miles.

N. B. As the orbit of the earth is an ellipse, not a circle, the distance of the earth from the Sun will be greater in its aphelion, and less in its perihelion, than here assigned.

Dear Sir,

I have from Mr. Short&#x27;s observations deduced, as above, the mean distance of the Sun from the earth, and am pretty sure I have made no material mistake.

I am

Your&#x27;s entirely,

Dec. 18, 1762.
