Late

And

Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh, &amp;c.

Sir,

I cannot sufficiently extol that eminent Zeal you have shewn on all Occasions for the Promotion of Natural Knowledge, the present Perfection of which is greatly indebted to your Labours and Patronage. The noble
DEDICATION

noble and immense Collection you have made of the most rare and valuable Curiosities, and a Library the most complete in the Universe, in all the Branches of Natural History and Physic, have not only been a Treasure to yourself, but a common Benefit to Mankind; your generous Disposition having constantly led you to communicate their Use to whoever at home or abroad was desirous to improve himself, or to inform the rest of the World.

As your great Knowledge and Skill in your own Profession, brought you into the highest and most extensive Practice for a long and uninterrupted Course of Years, so your Merit and Reputation could not fail of setting you at the Head of those two learned Bodies, you had so much loved and served, the Royal College of Physicians, and the Royal Society of LONDON, over which you presided with so much Dignity and Honour.

Your Favours to the Royal Society in particular, have been too many to be here mentioned;
DEDICATION.

tioned; and your Regard for that Body hath ever been conspicuous, by your constant and diligent Application to their Affairs, in the midst of the greatest and most necessary Avocations; yet such has been your Modesty, that you have lately, to our general Regret, resigned the Office of President, which you could not be induced to hold any longer, when you began to apprehend the Infirmities of a venerable Age might oblige you to be less constant in your Attendance on the Duties of it.

Give me Leave, Sir, in this Place, also to record my own Thankfulness to you, by whose Recommendation I at first obtained the Honour of being chosen one of the Secretaries of the Royal Society, which hath been so many Years continued to me; an Employ, I hope, I have discharged, at least, with Diligence and Fidelity, and shall always endeavour so to do: I beg of you to take under your Protection those Volumes of Papers sent to the Royal Society, that have been published under my Inspection, and particu-
DEDICATION

larly to Patronize this Forty-first Volume of the Philosophical Transactions, which ends with the last Year of your Presidentship. I remain,

Honoured SIR,

Your much devoted and obliged

Humble Servant,
