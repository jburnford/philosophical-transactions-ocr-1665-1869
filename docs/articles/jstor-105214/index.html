<div class="ocr-text">that this new styptic, which creates no pain (unless what may sometimes proceed from the necessary degree of pressure in the application of it), may be relied upon in all cases, where the needle and ligature has hitherto been thought the least painful, and only secure means of stopping blood in the arteries.

A happy discovery indeed, should this prove the consequence of it, as I heartily wish it may, for the ease and benefit of the miserable part of mankind, who fall under our hands; and am,

C. Extract of a Letter from Mons. Bonnet, F. R. S. of Geneva, to John Clephane, M. D. F. R. S. translated from the French.

THE inoculation of the small-pox continues to be attended with the greatest success in our city. Of seventy, who were inoculated, there was not one in any danger. Lausanne has been as it were forced to imitate us; and we hope, that this excellent method, which we received from England, will spread itself from one place to another, for the good of mankind.

Four of the seven towers are much hurt; one of them, which is an octagon, has two of its sides thrown down from top to bottom. It is said several of the Janisaries, who were upon guard there, are killed. The three other of the four are much shatter&#x27;d, and part of the walls fallen down. All the turrets upon the city-wall, from the seven towers to the Adrianople-gate, are much shatter&#x27;d, though none fallen: all the cupolas of the portico of Sultan Mahomet the II&#x27;d&#x27;s mosque are thrown down: the Sickergee Han, a strong stone building near the above mosque, is quite destroyed: some part of the wall of the Cara Han is thrown down: one bagnio is quite fallen, and many people said to be destroyed in it. The Cautirligee Han is quite down; and the Vizir</div>
