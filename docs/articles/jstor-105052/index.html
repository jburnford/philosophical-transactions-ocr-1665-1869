<div class="ocr-text">XXXIX. Extract of Two Letters from Dr. Alston, Bot. Prof. at Edinburgh, to Dr. Mortimer, Secr. R. S. The first dated 17 March, 1749; the second, August 9, 1750.

Read Oct. 24, 1751.

A PROPERTY of quick-lime, which I believe was not observed before. In June 1743, for some experiments in vegetation, I infused about 2 pounds of quick-lime in 24 pounds of water, resolving to change the lime, so soon as it did not communicate its virtues to the water. I soon made use of the first lime-water, and filled the vessel with fresh water. When that was exhausted, I fill&#x27;d it up a third time; and so on for twenty or thirty times: for I had no reason to change the lime for three years; so long it was good lime-water, gather&#x27;d crusts on its surface, turned syrup of violets green, vegetable infusions yellow, tasted as at the first. But at the end of the third, it gather&#x27;d no more crusts, was no more lime-water.

The quick-lime, which I kept dry, fell soon into a powder; it stood cover&#x27;d these three years (the vessel with the lime-water in it was an inverted large bell-glass, never cover&#x27;d) in the green-house. This powder I infused in water, but it communicated no virtue to it whatever. This perhaps you will difficultly believe, but it is easy to make the experiment. The calx vive, that I used, was made of the common limestone. It is also a common observation of our farmers, that the effect of lime on lands lasts only 3 years.

Second Letter, August 9, 1750.

The paradox, which I formerly mention&#x27;d, concerning *calx vive*, which no body would at first believe, I have demonstrated by repeated experiments, by which it appears, that the stone *calx vive* may afford more than six hundred times its own weight of good lime-water; for from half a drachm of quick-lime I had forty ounces of lime-water; from one pound of quick-lime 500 pounds of lime-water; and the lime is not yet exhausted, the water being as good now as at first, by every experiment that I know. I poured some of it cold (very lately) on some small *calculi*, in a drinking-glass, and in one night&#x27;s time such phenomena appeared, as notably explained, as well as confirmed, the use of lime-water in the stone. I found also, that quick-lime kept dry, in the open air, 14 months, communicated nothing to water, tho&#x27; long infused in it: that lime-water, boiled down to a fourth part, is not weaken&#x27;d, neither sensibly stronger; yet yields a very little of small slender prismatic crystals. I am, Sir,

Your obliged most humble servant,

Charles Alston.</div>
