<div class="ocr-text">XXI. Extract of a Letter from John Howard, Esq; F.R.S. to William Watson, M.D. F.R.S. giving some Observations on the Heat of the Waters at Bath.

Read April 2, 1767.

WHEN I had the pleasure of seeing you in London, you thought some explanation of the paper, upon the heat of the Bath-waters, necessary. The observations, I assure you, were made with great care. The three first of them were made at the pump, where the waters are usually drunk. I went several times into the king&#x27;s, and queen&#x27;s, baths; and took them, where the springs rise in the king&#x27;s bath, which is the warmest part, and the most distant from thence the coolest. The pump in that bath corresponded with the upper pump. This I mention; as in the other two baths, the thermometers did not rise, by one degree, so high as in the upper pumps; though I had the pumps worked a considerable time, to warm the pipes. The temperature of the other baths you see in my paper. The hot bath, not being so warm as the king&#x27;s, at first, surprized me, until I considered their times of filling; and then the comparative slowness of the springs of the hot bath, to those of the king&#x27;s, accounted for this difference.

The other observations are of various springs, in and about Bath; that near St. James&#x27;s church is the coldest.
The springs, at the old and new well houses at Bristol, are very different; but, on repeated trials, I found them so.
