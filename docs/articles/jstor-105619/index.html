<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">XLII. Observations on the same Transit of Venus made at Constantinople: By his Excellency James Porter, Esq; his Majesty&#x27;s Ambassador there: In a Letter to George Amyand, Esq;

Read Nov. 19, 1761.

I have not time to write to any of the Royal Society. Pray tell Mr. Burrew, with my compliments, Father Bofcowitz will be here only in September, or October, with the new Venetian ambassador.

The sun rises at Stanbole, Constantinople, the 6th June, $4^h\ 32&#x27;$.

Venus entered the sun much earlier, and is supposed to have entered its disk above an hour and more, when seen at its rising here.

Venus, at emerging out of the sun&#x27;s disk, touched the interior limb of the sun S.E. at $10^h\ 15&#x27;$.

Emerged totally the point of contact, at its going out, at $10^h\ 32&#x27;\ 20&#x27;&#x27;$.

Observed with a Hadley&#x27;s reflector 18 inches only, and a good pendulum, with seconds.

Yours,

J. P.
