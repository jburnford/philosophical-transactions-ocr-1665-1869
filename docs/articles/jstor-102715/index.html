<div class="ocr-text">III. An Experiment shewing, that the Springs or Constituent Parts of Air are capable to suffer such disorder, by a violent impulse, as to require time to recover their Natural State; by Mr. Fr. Hauksbee, F. R. S.

The foregoing Experiment, being so very odd in its appearance, gave me the Curiosity to enquire a little farther into the matter of Fact, and to try whether Air could be capable of being Wounded, (if I may call it so), or to suffer such a disorder of Parts, by a violent impulse, as to require time to recover their Natural State: I devised the following Experiment.

I took my Condensing Engine, (which is so well known to this Society, I shall not need to describe it here); into the bottom part of its Brass Receiver I put about half a Pint of Water; then the upper part being screw&#x27;d strongly on, I threw into it, with the Syringe, about 3 or 4 Atmospheres of Air (as near as I could guess), suffering it to remain in that state sometime more than an Hour; then letting out as much of the Air (by taking off my Syringe) as would readily depart, I immediately screw&#x27;d on in its Place a Box of Leather Collars, through which past a small Glass Tube, whose lower Orifice was plung&#x27;d under the Surface of the included Water. I found in a very little time the Water had ascended in the Tube near a Foot, and continued rising
rising for some time, till it had reach&#x27;d near 16 Inches; which plainly shews, that the Springs of Air, by being somewhat over bent, do not presently (altho at Liberty) recover their Pristine State. And were they to suffer a more violent compressure, and to remain for a Week, Month, or a Year, in the same State, I doubt not but according to the length of time, and degrees of Condensation, a proportional time would be requir&#x27;d to recover them to their Natural State again. But what is the Force made use of in this Experiment, in comparison to that of Fir&#x27;d Gunpowder, where the suddenness, and violentness of the Impulse, is unaccountable; however, it serves well to confirm the Suggestion I had, that Air might so suffer in its Parts by Force or an Unnatural Extention of them, as to require time to recover their Pristine Natural State.

Upon a Repetition of the same Experiment, only the Condensed Air remained in the same state, as at first injected, for about 18 Hours: then letting out the Air as before, the Premention&#x27;d Box with its Tube was screw&#x27;d on; and upon Observation I found, that as the Springs of the Air did unbend themselves, so they press&#x27;d more and more on the Surface of the included Water, which rais&#x27;d it higher and higher in the Tube, as they approach&#x27;d nearer their Natural State. This continued for about 6 Hours, at which time the little Tube was accidentally broke, and our farther Observations for that time frustrated.
