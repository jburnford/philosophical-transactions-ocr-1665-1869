<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">VII. An Extract of a Letter from Mr. Hopkins to Mr. John Senex, F. R. S. concerning an extraordinary large Horn of the Stag Kind, taken out of the Sea on the Coast of Lancashire.

INCLOSED is a Sketch of an Horn, which I thought of an extraordinary Size, the Dimensions whereof are exactly set down, as I took them myself, by laying a String along the Surface. Vid. Fig. 4.

Part of the left Horn of a Stag,
a e the Length 30 Inches.
b b the Circumference above the third Branch, 7 Inches.
c the Circumference above the second Branch, 8 Inches.
d d the Circumference between the Brow and second Antler, 11 Inches.
e e the Circumference 10 Inches.
d e the Circumference of the Brow-Antler, 6½ Inches.
e f the Length of the Antler, 16½ Inches.

This Horn was drawn out of Raven&#x27;s Barrow Hole, adjoining to Holker Old Park, by the Net of a Fisherman, on the 20th of June, 1727. The Tide flows constantly where it was found, and the Land is very high near it.

This Horn is now in the Possession of Sir Thomas Lowther, Bart. of Holker, in Cartmell in Lancashire.

SIR, Your Humble Servant,

J. Hopkins.
Several Horns of this Kind, and extraordinary Size, have been frequently dug up in Bogs in Ireland, but I never met with an Account of any being found in the Sea before. I shall refer the Curious to the Account of the large Horns found under Ground in Ireland, communicated to the Royal Society by Sir Thomas Molyneux, M.D. F.R.S. which is printed in these Transactions, Numb. 227, p.489, &amp;c. and to the Description of the Moose Deer by the Honourable Paul Dudley, Esq; F.R.S. Numb. 368, p.165, &amp;c.

VIII. Three Cases communicated by Claudius Amyand, Esq; F.R.S. Serjeant Surgeon to his Majesty.

I. Concerning a Child born with the Bowels hanging out of the Belly.

II. Of an extraordinary Cause of a Suppression of Urine in a Woman.

III. Of a Stricture in the middle of the Stomach in a Girl, dividing it into two Bags.

I. The 18th of December, 1730, Mr. L——&#x27;s Child was born with the greatest Part of the Bowels hanging out of the Belly, by an Aperture about half an Inch in Diameter on the Right Side of the Navel String. The Birth was natural and easy.

Being called, I found the Aperture lined with a Skin, and a Ligament that opposed the Reduction;</div>
