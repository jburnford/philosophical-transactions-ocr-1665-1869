2. I took out 45 ounces and better, of blood, out of the Jugular Vein of a Sheep, of a lesser size than the former; by which time, the Spectators, as well as myself, found her exceeding faint, and some thought her pass&#x27;d recovery, without a supply of blood. Then I convey&#x27;d blood from the Jugular Vein of a Calf into that of the Sheep, for the space of 7 minutes, when we did believe, by the continuance of a good stream from the Calf, that the Sheep had already received more blood, than she had lost. Whereupon we set her free, and she had no sooner got her liberty, but seeing a Dog near her (which was a Spaniel, that had formerly suffered the transmission of Sheeps-blood into him) she butted with great violence at him three or four times, not appearing at all concern&#x27;d at what she had endured in the Experiment. We keep this Sheep alive, she being sent to grass again, and seeming hitherto very strong and lusty.

The Calf was much larger than the Sheep. We bled the Calf to death, and received from him six Porringers full of blood, after the Sheep had been suppleid, each Porringer containing 11½ ounces of water. The Sheep lost four of the same measures full of blood; which being supply&#x27;d by that of the Calf, we reckon, that the Calf lost 10 such measures in all.

An Account
Of another Experiment of Transfusion, viz.
of Bleeding a Mangy into a Sound Dog.

This was made by Mr. Thomas Coxe, and imparted likewise to the Royal Society in manner following.

I procured an old Mungrell Curr, all over-run with the Mainge, of a middle size, and having, some hours before, fed him plentifully with Cheese-parings and Milk, I prepared the Jugular Vein,
as we use to do the Carotidal Artery of the Emittent Animal, not designing any thing further, than to determine by Experiment the Infection of the Recipient&#x27;s blood. Then I made as strong a Ligature upon the Dogs Neck, as I durst, for fear of choking him, to the end, that the Venal blood, which is much more sluggish in its motion and evacuation, than the Arterial, might be emitted with the greater advantage of Impetus.

Then I took a young Land-Spaniel, of about the same bigness, and prepared his Jugular Vein, as is usually done in the Recipient Animal; the heart-ward part of the Vein to receive the Maingy Dogs blood, and the head-ward part of it to discharge his own into a Dish.

Having thus prepared them both, and placed them in a convenient posture one to the other, I let slip the running knots, and by frequent compression of the Neck (besides the Ligature I had made) by reason of the tardy running of the Venal blood out of the Emittent, transfused about 14 or 16 ounces of the blood of the Infected, into the Veins of the Sound Dog, as near as I could guess by the quantity of blood, which ran into a Dish from the Recipient, supposing the Recipient Animal to lose near about the same proportion to what the Emittent supplies.

The effect of which Experiment was, no alteration at all, any way, to be observed in the Sound Dog. But for the Maingy Dog, he was in about 10 dayes or a fortnights space perfectly cured: which might with probability enough, I think, have been expected from the considerable evacuation, he made; (perhaps the quickest and surest remedy for the cure of that sort of disease, he was infected with, both in Man and Beast.)</div>
