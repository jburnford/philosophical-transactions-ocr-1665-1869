VIII. *A Letter from the Revd Ebenezer 
Latham, M.D. and V.D.M. to C. 
Mortimer, M.D. Sec. R. S. containing a 
Proposal to make the Poles of a Globe of 
the Heavens move in a Circle round the 
Poles of the Ecliptic; read at a Meeting 
of the Royal Society, April 17. 1738.*

S I R,

Findern, April 14, 38.

I take the Liberty through your Hands to commu-
nicate the inclosed to the Royal Society, and at 
the same time to submit to that learned Body a Pro-
posal
posal I would make relating to an Improvement in
the Construction of the Globes of the Heavens. As
we now have them, you know they are only form&#x27;d
for the present Age, and do not serve the Purposes of
Chronology and History, as they might, if the Poles
whereon they turn were contriv&#x27;d to move in a Circle
round those of the Ecliptic, according to the present
Obliquity of this. By this Means we might have a
View of the Heavens suited to every Period, and that
would answer the antient Descriptions, those of Eu-
doxus, for Instance, who is supposed to borrow his
from the most early Observations; and of Hipparchus,
&amp;c. Nor could any Contrivance better enable the
lowest Reader to judge of the Merits of the Contro-
versy about the Argonautic Expedition, as far as it
depends on this: For it will verify to the Sight the
Path of the Colures, &amp;c. at any Time. I thought to
have transmitted a Scheme of the whole, in which
the Equator must be fix&#x27;d to the brazen Meridian, &amp;c.
But it is easily understood, and can only wait the Ap-
probation of such great Judges to recommend it to
the Artists.

Your most obedient,

Humble Servant,

E. Latham.

N. B. That Globes, to answer the End here proposed,
tho&#x27; differently constructed, had long before been made and
published by Mr. Senex, who at next Meeting gave the fol-
lowing Account of his Contrivance.</div>
