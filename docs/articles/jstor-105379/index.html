<div class="ocr-text">I do not remember, that I heard any noise or whizzing in the air as it passed; nor did any sulphureous smell attend it, that I could perceive.

I looked on my watch immediately after it was gone by, and found by that, it was just twenty minutes past five; but, as I could not be sure that went right, I chose to mention the time in more general terms.

It was seen by vast numbers of people, and much talked of the next day.

I am, dear Sir, with much esteem,

Your very humble servant,

XXXIII. An Account of the Meteor seen at Chigwell Row, in Essex, on the 20th of October 1759: In a Letter to the Rev. Dr. Birch, Secretary of the Royal Society, from Mr. William Dutton, Watchmaker in Fleet-street.

SIR, Fleet-street, Dec. 1, 1759.

Read Dec. 6, 1759.

In compliance with Dr. Pringle&#x27;s request, I send you the following account of the meteor, which I saw some time ago, viz. on Saturday, Octob. 20th, about a quarter before six in the evening, whilst there was still some day-light, tho&#x27; several stars had begun to appear.

At that time I happened to be walking with my face eastward, with a companion, at Chigwell Row,
in Essex (which lies about 12 miles east of London, and upon a pretty high hill), when we observed a meteor bearing northward of the east, in appearance not high up in the air, tho&#x27; with a considerable angle of elevation, perhaps of about 70 or 80 degrees, with its declination from the zenith eastwards. It moved with great velocity, in a direction from north to south, and seemingly in a curve line downwards; but vanished at the height of 4 or 5 degrees above the horizon, then bearing nearly south of us. It was of a round form, about the size of the planet Venus, when seen at the largest, of a light bluish cast, but very bright. At its vanishing, several particles, still brighter than itself, and somewhat like the stars, that are seen upon the breaking of a rocket, seemed to issue out of it. We perceived a faint light to follow it, like the tail of a comet, and about two feet in length. The whole time of the appearance did not exceed 3 or 4 seconds. This is the best account I can give of what I saw; and my companion, to whom I have shewn this letter, agrees with me in all these circumstances. I am,

SIR,

Your very humble servant,

Wm. Dutton.
