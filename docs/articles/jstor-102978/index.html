<div class="ocr-text">II. Part of a Letter from Mr Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S. concerning Pewter Money, Coyn&#x27;d in Ireland, by the late King James.

Leeds, June 7. 1704.

Honoured Sir,

This brings you an account of a Curiosity that relates to the late King James&#x27;s Irish Moneys, which I am apt to think you never heard of, viz. a Crown piece of Pewter, inscribed Melioris tessera fata. &#x27;Twas sent me by the Gentleman who found them in the Treasury at Dublin; whose account is so particular and curious, that I will choose to give it you in his own words.

&quot;That King James, having turned all the Brass Guns of Ireland, and all the Brass and Copper Vessels of Protestants that he could seize, into Coyn, viz. Half-Crowns somewhat bigger than an English Half-penny, Shillings broader, but not so thick as a Farthing, and Six-pences in proportion; it was order&#x27;d to pass current in all Payments, even in Bonds, and discharge of Judgments and Statutes; (insomuch that if Ages to come knew not the reason, they would admire to be told, that there was a time when men absconded, to avoid receiving their Debts, as many here did;) But these stocks of Metal being all spent (which he began to Coyn in June 1689.) and no Circulation to bring them back into his Treasury, he call&#x27;d in all that he had Coyned, and the Half-Crowns, which before
were stamped with a Face, were re-stamped with his Effigies on Horseback, and then paid out to those who brought them in, as Crowns; and the smaller Coyns were melted down, and re-coyned again under the same Denominations, but with less Metal. After the turn was served by this Stratagem, he had not where-withal to import Copper and Brass; but, for want of it, fell foul on the Pewter Dishes, &amp;c.—And the piece I sent you of that Metal was Coyned for five Shillings; and the Proclamation to make it passable was as ready as the Stamps, for it was prepared: But King William passing the Boyne, prevented their Proclaiming it. There was very little of it Coyned, for our Government could meet with none of it; until one day, rummaging all their Tinkerly Treasure, that they had left behind them in Dublin when they were routed, by accident I met with one Bag of 150 of those Pieces. So that the Piece I sent you, although it&#x27;s of no Intrinsick Value, it&#x27;s a Rarity; and had I thought it would have been acceptable, I would have sent you a Specimen of every sort that he had Coyned and Re-coyned here. I am,

Sir, Your very Humble Servant,

Dublin, Novemb.
the 27th, 1696.

Tho. Putland.

This Valuable Curiosity has the same Inscription on both sides, as the common Brass Crowns; but there is this Legend added upon the Rim of it, MELIORIS TESSERA FATI ANNO REGNI SEXTO.</div>
