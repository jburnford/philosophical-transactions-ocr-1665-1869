<div class="ocr-text">The ensuing Night was very stormy; a large Quantity of Hail fell about Two in the Morning; and the Barometer was extremely low.

Those are the principal Circumstances that I am acquainted with, relating to the late Earthquake. I depend upon your Candour and Goodness to excuse the loose manner in which they are thrown together.

XLIV.

Mr. Henry Baker F. R. S. to the President,
containing an Extract of a Letter from Mr. W. Arderon F. R. S. concerning an Explosion in the Air, heard at Norwich, June 7. 1750.

SIR,

Read June 15. Mr. Arderon writes me Word from Norwich, that, on Thursday last, the 7th instant, as he and a Friend were walking to take the Air, a little to the Westward of that City, they heard, about 7 o’Clock in the Evening, a kind of hollow Noise, as loud as that of a large Cannon. Which Noise was once repeated nigh the same Place as an Echo, and then continued dying as it were away for about half a Minute.

They saw no Lightning, nor any Clouds, except a few thin whitish ones in the Western Horizon.

It was heard, he says, by great Numbers of People in the City of Norwich, notwithstanding the continual
continual Noise and Hurry there: He likewise received Accounts of it from Swanthorpe, 6 Miles SW; and from Racka, 4 Miles NE of that City, agreeing with the above Description.

He has not heard that any Person observed any Tremor of the Earth; and confesses his own Surprise was so great, he does not know whether there was or not.

Mr. Wilson, a Gentleman who was with him, thought the Noise much resembled the Fall of a great Building; and a Gentleman at Norwich described it like a large Weight falling down upon a Chamber-floor over his Head.

I received the above Account last Monday; and as this Year has been productive of many unusual Phenomena, I hope you will excuse my laying this before you amongst the rest. I am,

SIR,

Catherine-Street,
June 1st, 1750.

Your most obedient Servant,

H. Baker.</div>
