<div class="ocr-text">come to be clogg&#x27;d in their motion: Whence it seem&#x27;d reasonable to expect that upon the Reunion of the Saline particles into such a Body, as they had constituted before, the redintegrated Sal Armoniack having neer upon, the same Texture, would, upon its being redissolv&#x27;d, produce the same, or a not much inferior degree of Coldness: And hereupon, though I well enough foresaw that an Armoniack solution, being boil&#x27;d up in Earthen vessels (for Glass ones are too chargeable) would, by piercing them, both lose some of the more subtle parts, and thereby somewhat impaire the texture of the rest; yet I was not deceiv&#x27;d in Expecting, that the dry Salt, remaining in the pipkins, being redissolv&#x27;d in a due proportion of water, would very considerably infrigidate it, as may further appear by the Notes, which for your greater satisfaction you will find here subjoyn&#x27;d; as soon as I have told you, that, though for want of other vessels I was first reduc&#x27;d to make use of Earthen ones, and the rather, because some Metallin Vessels will be injur&#x27;d by the dissolv&#x27;d Sal Armoniack, if it be boil&#x27;d in them; yet I afterwards found some conveniences in Vessels of other Metall, as of Iron; whereof you may command a farther Account:

March the 29th, the Thermoscope in the Air was at 8½ inches; being put into a somewhat large evaporating glass, fill&#x27;d with water, it fell (after it stood a pretty while, and had been agitated in the liquor) to 8 inches: then about half the Salt, or less, that had been used twice before, and felt much less cold than the water, being put in and sturr&#x27;d about, the tincted Spirit subsided with a visible progress, till it was fall manifestly beneath 4 inches; and then, having caused some water to be freshly pump&#x27;d and brought in; though the newly mention&#x27;d Solution were mixt with it, yet it presently made the Spirit of Wine manifestly to ascend in the Instrument, much faster, than one would have expected, &amp;c.

And thus much may suffice for this time concerning our Frigorifick Experiment; which I scarce doubt but the Cartesians will lay hold on as very favourable to some of their Tenens; which you will easily believe, it is not to the Opinion, I have elsewhere oppos&#x27;d, of those Modern Philosophers, that would have Salt-petre to be the Primum Frigidum: (though I found by trial, that, whilst &#x27;tis actually dissolving; it gives a much considerabler degree of Cold, than otherwise.) But about the Reflexions, that may be made on this Experiment, and the Variations, and Improvements, &amp; Ules of it, though I have divers things lying by me; yet, since you have seen several of them already, and may command a sight of the rest, I shall forbear the mention of them here, not thinking it proper, to swell the bulk of this Letter with them.

An Account of two Books lately printed in London.

1. Euclidis Elementa Geometrica, novo ordine ac methodo demonstrata. In this compendious and pretty Edition, the Anonymous Author pretends to have rendred these Elements more expeditious; by bringing all together into one place, what belongs to one and the same subject: Comprising 1. What Euclid hath said of Lines, Streight, Intersecting one another, and Parallel. 2. What he hath demonstrated of a Single Triangle; and of Triangles Compared one with another. 3. What of the Circle, and its Properties. 4. What of Proportions in Triangles and other Figures. 5. What of Quadrats and Rectangles, made of Lines diversly
6. What of Plane Superficies&#x27;s. 7. What of Solids. After which follow the Problems. The Definitions are put to each Chapter as need requireth. The Axioms, because they are few, and almost everywhere necessary, are not thus distributed in Chapters. The Postulata, are not subjoyn&#x27;d to the Axioms, but reserv&#x27;d for the Problems, the Author esteeming, that they being practical Principles, had only place in Problems.

This for the Order: As to the Manner of Demonstrating, One and the same is observ&#x27;d in most Propositions; all with much brevity; to the end, that what is not of itself difficult, may not be made so, by multitude of Words and Letters.

II. THE ENGLISH VINE-YARD VINDICATED. The Author (Mr. John Rose, his Majesties Gardener at his Royal Garden in St. James&#x27;s) makes it his business in this small Tract (a very thin Pocket-book) by a few short Observations made by himself, to direct Englishmen in the Choice of the Fruit, and the Planting of Vine-yards, heretofore very frequently cultivated, though of late almost quite neglected by them.

He discourses skilfully, 1. Of the several sorts of Vines, and what Grapes are most suitable to the Climate of England; where he chiefly commends the Small Black-grape, or Cluster-grape; the Parsley grape; the White Muscadine; the Frontiniack; and a new White-grape, with a red Wood and a dark green Leaf: All these being early ripe fruit. 2. Of the Soyle, and Situation of a Vine-yard in England: Where, as to the First, he pitches upon a Light Soile, having a bottom of Chalk or Gravel, and given to Brambles, observing, that no Plant whatsoever is so connotural to the Vine for Soyl, as the Bramble. As for the Situation, he chooses that side or declivity of a Hill, that lies to the South or Southwest; and is favoured with other Hills somewhat higher, or Woods on the North and East, to break the rigour of those quarters. This direction he thinks of that importance, that he affirms, that the discouragement of the Culture of Vines in England has only proceeded from men&#x27;s mis-information on this material article of Choice of Soyle and Situation. 3. How to prepare the Ground for the Plantation, vid. by plowing up the Swarth in July, and by disposing the Turf in small heaps, and so burning them, and spreading the ashes over the Land; care being taken, that by heaping too much materials together, the Earth be not over-burnt by the excessive heat and fire, which they require to reduce them to ashes.

What is added, of the Manner of planting the Setts; of Dressing, Pruning and Governing the Plantation; of the Ordering and Cultivating the Vineyard after the first four years, till it needs renewing; as also of the manner and time, how and when to manure the Vine-yard, with Compost, will be better understood from the Book itself, than can be here described; the Author pretending, that, those few observations of his, as the native production of his own Experience, being practised with care, the Vine-yards in England may be planted, govern&#x27;d and perpetuated with undoubted success; and offering withall to furnish those, that have a desire to renew this Culture, and to store their grounds with Sets and Plants of all those sorts, which he recommends; he having a plentiful stock of them all.
