<div class="ocr-text">for Circles, the distances of the Points of intersection are the Tangents of the half and the whole Arch of the Meridian so intersected. But as to the Points of Intersection, which determine the Problem proposed, they may be found without the aid of the former way, from a Gnomonick and Stereographick method of measuring and setting off the sides and angles of Spherical Triangles in those Projections, which is necessary in what follows.

3. If the Problem is to be perform&#x27;d by Mixt Geometry, as by a Circle and either a Parabola, Hyperbola, or Ellipsis, the Circle may be conceived to be the South-contrary Section of a Cone projected by the Eye at the South-pole, and any of the rest of the Sections by the Eye at the Center of the Sphere.

4. If by any of the Conick Sections however posited; the projecting Plain may remain the same, but the Eye must be in some other part of the Surface of the Sphere, and not in the Axis.

These things were mentioned to invite the Learned to their Consideration: I shall only further add, that we cannot say what may be expected from the labours and endeavors of divers Learned men of this Nation, particularly from Dr. Wallis, who hath so excellently resolved and constructed all Cubick Equations at the end of the first Treatise of his Opera Mathematica by aide of a Cubick Parabolaster, mentioning, that by such Curves the Roots of all Equations may be found: And who hath promised a Treatise of Algebra and Angular Sections, wherein the Reader need not doubt to meet with satisfaction in these Mysteries. Nor ought we to omit the mentioning of the Modest and Learned Mr. Barrow, who (among many other excellent Subjects, and particularly his Opticks now, at the Press) hath perform&#x27;d, what the famous Italian Geometer Mich. A. Ricci hath promis&#x27;d in Exercitata Geometrica (printed at Rome 1666, and lately reprinted here) about Curves of several degrees, that serve to determine and resolve all Equations: which hath likewise been done by other Learn&#x27;d men of this Nation.

I. PRÆLUDIA BOTANICA Roberti Morison Scotti Aberdonensis. Londini, impensis Fac. Allestry, 1669. in8o.

This Prelude of this Excellent Botanist hath two parts; The first gives us an Alphabetical Catalogue of all the Plants in the Royal
Royal Garden of Blois in France, as the same was enrich&#x27;d by the Munificence and Encouragement of the Most Illustrious Prince Gaston, late Duke of Orleans, with 360 Plants, in the space of five years, by the singular care and skill of our Author; who in this Catalogue hath not only given a succinct and pithy description of the Plants here enumerated, but also by certain marks distinguish&#x27;t the Perennial ones from the Annual; adding some general Observations collected from the Garden above mentioned, very necessary and useful to all that are studious in Botanicks.

The second contains some Animadversions not inconsiderable, both on the Pinax of Caspar Bauhinus; shewing his mistakes as well in the Digesting as Naming of Plants; and on the 3 Tomes of the Universal History of Plants of Johannes Bauhinus.

To which is annexed a Dialogue between a Fellow of the R. Society and the Author, containing an Answer to several Queries proposed; where is intimated the best General Method taken from Nature itself, of digesting all Plants, and reducing them to certain Classes or Heads according to the difference of their Seeds, Podd&#x27;s and Flowers; by the advantage whereof the Study and Remembering of Plants may be much facilitated, and the Contemplation thereof among all sorts of Men exceedingly promoted: For the publishing of which kind of Method our Author professeth himselfe to be already in great forwardness, entertaining good hopes, he shall by the Assistance and Encouragement of the Generous, be enabled to give good satisfaction to the Curious therein.

II. C L S A L M A S I I Prefatio in Librum De HOMONYMIS HYLESIATRICÆ: Eiusdem de PLI NIO JUDICIUM. Divisio, A. 1668, in quarto

This Book is an Introduction to a large Volume, compos&#x27;d by the famous Salmasius, and now in the hands of those two Honourable persons, that have taken care of the Publishing of this Preface; both Counsellors of the Parliament of Burgundy, Messieurs Lantin and De la Mare; which Volume gives an Account of the many and great mistakes committed hitherto in the History of Plants; upon the score of Naming them: In the doing of which it hath come to pass, that severall names being often given to one and the same Plant, and vice versa, one and the same name to different Plants, there hath ensued a great and dangerous confusion in that large part of the Materia Medica, highly requiring to be rectified. Now to that Work this Preface prepares the way, by shewing to the studious in Botanics.
Botanicks and Medicine, the Argument, Order, and Usefulness of the same, interspersing withall the Causes and Origin of those many Errors, which both Antients and Moderns have fallen into upon this Subject; as also the negligence of those Antients; the Progress of Physick among the Romans; and the Age of the chief Writers on this Argument: Adding also the Authors opinion concerning Pliny, what is to be approved, what to be condemned in him, and how far we are to proceed in the admiration of that Writer.

But the Reader will doubtless receive the best satisfaction concerning this Book, from M. Lantin himselfe, as he was pleased to give it in a late Letter of his to the Publisher, accompanying the Present, he made of several Copies of it to the R. Society, and to divers particular Members thereof, delighting in Botanical Studies; to this effect.

Sir, I send you some Exemplars of the Introduction to a great Work, which M. Dela Mare and I have caused to be printed, to excite the Lovers of Learning to facilitate the impression of the Whole Book. I promise myself, that this Present will not be unacceptable to you, as well in respect of the Author, who, besides his great Learning generally known, had the Honour to be lov&#x27;d by his Majesty of G. Brittain, as for the worth of the Treatise itself; of which you may judge by this Preface. Although it be a work altogether Critical, and which, Correcting only Errors about the Names of Simples, may seem to contribute but little to the knowledge of Nature, for the Advancement of which your Illustrious Society employs all its Studies and Labors with so much reputation; yet I may say, that even this Book may serve for the accomplishment of that great Design, forasmuch as in discovering the Errors and Negligence of the Antients, and of the Moderns that have follow&#x27;d them in the History of Plants, it shows the necessity there is to labour after a new Natural History, that may be free from those defects, if we intend to lay solid foundations for knowledge, and particularly for the Art of Medicine. In the meantime, those that practise it, being often constrain&#x27;d to use Simples, the virtue of which is not known to them but by the Experience of the Antients, may by Aid of this Book avoid very dangerous mistakes.

But what Judgment sooner you shall make both of the Book and its Preface, I shall be satisfied, if you and your Illustrious Friends, (to whom I intreat you to present some of the Copies accompanying this,) shall receive them as a mark of my esteem of the R. Society, the design of which I admire as the Noblest, that ever was undertaken by men. I incessantly praise their Industry, Prudence and Sincerity, and infinitely value the parts and knowledge of those, that compose it. And this occasion shall also serve Me to &amp;c.
