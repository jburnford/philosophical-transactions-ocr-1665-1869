I have heard also (but cannot aver it) of a thin, fine Venice-glass, cracked with the strong and lasting sound of a Trompet or Cornet (near it) sounding an Unison or a Consonant note to that of the Tone or Ting of the Glass.

An Improvement of the Bononian Stone shining in the dark.

The Worthy Signor Malpighi in a late Letter of his to the Publisher, of the 9th of March, takes notice, that one Signor Zagonius had a way of making out of the Bononian Stone calcined, Statues and Pictures variously shining in the dark.

He is very loath to have it observed, and therefore casts down his eyes when he walks in the streets, and turns them aside when he is in company. We had made several trials before he perceived our design; and afterward had much ado to make</div>
