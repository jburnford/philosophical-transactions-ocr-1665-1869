SECT. I. English and European Plants.

Narrow curl&#x27;d Hartstongue, Ray Hist. Plant. p. 134.

Tab. 81. Fig?

The Leaves are of a deep Green above and pale below; its middle Rib prominent on both sides, the edges lightly curl&#x27;d, and as it were serrated; they are above a Span long, and not an Inch broad. This elegant Fern has been long an Inhabitant in our European Gardens: That accurate Botanist, John Bauhine, says he first saw it in the Garden of his old Friend Mr. John Heitzman, Apothecary at Basil, A. D. 1608. since which it hath been translated to Paris and London.

Broad curl&#x27;d Hartstongue.

Lingua Cervina maxima undulato folio Bob. H. Oxon. 557. 5. Sect. 14. Tab 1. Cervina maxima, undulato folio &amp; auriculato per bosin Morini Jonq. H.R. Par. 75. Pluk. 248. Fig. 1. Phyllitis undulata Muntingij Phyt. Tab. 81. Fig. p. 286. c. 13. 3.
Its Leaves are of a pale yellowish Green, above 2 Inches broad, and a Span long; crumpled on the edges, but not so much as Doctor Plukenet figures it, neither is it notch&#x27;d on the edges, and in those respects Munting&#x27;s Figure is truer. Mr. Bobart&#x27;s also very well expresses it, which I suppose they both took from the living Plant. It&#x27;s auriculated at the base, and as it were perforated by lapping over the Stalks, in both which it differs from the Narrow Curl&#x27;d leaved. The Honourable Capt. Charles Hatton, my worthy and learned Friend, some Years since told me, he had seen many curious Varieties of this Plant in the Royal Garden at Paris, about the Time of that famous Flowerist Mons. Morin, who assured him he had raised them all from the Seed of the Common Hartstongue.

Trifid, Curl&#x27;d Hartstongue.

Lingua Cervina minor crispa, uno pediculo trifolia Val. H.R. Paris 108. Cervina minor crispa, folio multitudo ramosa, Pluk. Tab. 248. Fig. 2.

Dr. Plukenet&#x27;s Figure is an Original, and taken from the living Plant, which it very well represents, and his Name expresses.

Manna Grass, or Edible Cocksfoot. Riv 1272. 6.

Gramen Manna vulgo, Boerhaive Indice Plant Hort. Lugd. Bat. p. 230. 24. Gr. Manna esculentum Lob. pt. 2. p. 24. Ic. 2. Obs. 13. Fig. 2. Belg. 25. Fig. Adv. 4. Gr. Dactylon esculentum C. B. 8. pl. 8.

This is generally call&#x27;d Gramen Mannae, to which some add esculentum, because its eaten amongst the Germans; it civilly differs from our English broad-leaved Cocksfoot in its Culture. The Italians call both these Capriola, Sarguinaria, and Sanguinella (because the Boys there put the tops up their Nostrils to make them Bleed) The Germans call it Schweden. Mr. Ray in his History p. 1272. pl. 6.
pl. 6. joyns this with our English broad-leav&#x27;d Cocksfoot, viz the wild and mowred together. Its sown as Corn in place. many Places of Germany, and used by them in Pottage and Meat, as we do Oatmeal. Gesner says its eat in Sallets. It grew very plentifully in Chelsea Physick Garden from Seed, which Dr. Ludovicus Stockins, a curious Botanist, sent me.

Single Spiked Havergrass.

Festuca spiâ simplici aristaâ.

The lower part of the Spike is more obviously divided into 3 or 4 loose alternate Locustæ, each ending in a long arista or beard.

Asarabacca. Ray 207. 1.

Herniaria hirsuta folijs &amp; ramulis dense stipatis, fruticosa, viticulis lignosis, foliolis oblongiusculis brevis den. Names. fissa C.B. 281. xi. Var.

This seems to differ from the common hairy Rupture-Character. wort, in having more twiggy Branches, with Leaves and Flowers thicker set. Chelsea Garden is obliged to Mr. Jacob Bobart for this Plant, who was so kind as to send me Specimens of it some Years since.

Roman or Pill-Nettle, Rays English Herbal Tab. 1. F. xi.

These Leaves are much more jagged and deeper cut than the common, and what is most particular at the setting on of these are 3 long yellowish Thorns. The Flowers and Fruit like the common. Its accurately figured and described in Dr. Herman&#x27;s Paradysus Batavus, p. 246. as also in Dr. Magnol&#x27;s Cat. Horti Regii Montpeliensis. Dr. Tournfort first discovered this in Portugal, and Mr. Jezeel Jones has since gather&#x27;d it about Lisbon. This elegant Plant I have only seen in the Bishop of London&#x27;s Garden at Fulham.

Golden Mouseear, or Grim the Collier. Ray 243. 2.

Auricula Muris Hispanica, alijs Hieracium Pannonicum fl. saturate croceo I B. V. 2. l. 24 p. 1040. Fig. Hieracium Hortense floribus atropurpurecentibus C B. 128. xi. pr. 65. 18.

Its broad whole hairy Leaves, and deep Orange-coloured Flowers, distinguish it from all others. It Flowers in June and July, and sometimes again in September. It hath many Years been an Ornament in most Country Gardens.
Columna&#x27;s long stalk&#x27;d Hawkweed. Ray 234. 15.

Hieracium montanum alterum leptomacrocaulon, Col. Names. 249. c. 9. 93. Fig. montanum hirsutum minus C B.

Its beautiful Blush-coloured Flowers, which rarely happen in this Tribe (they being mostly yellow) distinguish it from others. It grows in Italy, where it Flowers in April, but in our Gardens later.

Rough Bushy Hawkweed.

Hieracium alperum ramosissimum.

This is a bushy Plant very much branched and matted, with small yellow Flowers, each standing on long naked Stalks, somewhat bearded and rough, not unlike the Lang du Beauf, but much less. I first gathered this in her Grace the Dutchess Dowager of Beaufort&#x27;s Garden at Chelsea, where it flower&#x27;d plentifully, as it hath since done in the Physick Garden.

Fine jagged Smooth Sowthistle. Ray 224. 3.

Chondrilla lutea I. B. 2. l. 24. p. 1020. Fig. Chabr. 317. Names:

Dr. Pluket&#x27;s Figure very well represents this Plant, which he design&#x27;d from a living Specimen formerly gathered in Chelsea Garden, where it flowered freely the last Summer.

Curl&#x27;d.
Curl&#x27;d Nipplewort. *Lampuana foliis crispis.*
Its lower Leaves, being finely curl&#x27;d, distinguish it from the common.

Hawkweed-Mary-gold. Ray 256. c. 3.

Phyt. 212. 17 Rhaadiolus Catalpini. Hieracium facie Hedypnoidis Park. 795. Fig. 1. Lob. 239. Ic. 1. Belg. 288. Fig.*

It resembles the Marygold in bearing yellow Flowers, with longish rough crooked solid Seed, but none flat. It grows wild about Basil and Mompelier, flowering in March and April.

Wart Succory. Ray 255. 5.

*Zacintha sive Cichoreum verrucosum C.B. in Matth. 389. Fig. 9. Chondrilla verrucaria C.B. Phyt. 215. 8. verr. folijs Cichorei viridibus C.B. 130. 10. Park. 779. Fig. 8.

Calceolarius, a very curious Apothecary at Verona, who sent this to Matibiolus, asserts, that the Leaves eaten as a Sallet, will effectually take away Warts, and that a Dram of the Seed taken inwardly for 3 Nights together, will do the same. Camerarius says a certain Surgeon at Padua cured Warts in any part of the Body, by giving a Spoonful of the Seed powdered for 3 Days at the Moons decrease, by which Secret he got a great deal of Money. Lobel affirms, that the Juice of the Leaves outwardly apply&#x27;d will cure Warts, as also taken in Wine it helps the biting of a Mad Dog. This Plant is said to take its Name from Zacintha, now call&#x27;d Zante, an Isle in the Ionian
Jonian Sea, where it was first discovered. Mr. Ray has observed it wild about Leghorn and Florence.

White Butterbur. Ray 261. 2.

*Petasites minor* folio Tusilaginis Jonquet 98. H.R. B&#x27;ess. Names. Pluk Tab. 212. Fig. 7. minor alter Tusilaginis folio Vallet 139.

The Leaves of this are very white underneath like Coltsfoot but more pointed. I have observed both these in Chelsea Garden.

Dutch Crupine. Ray 331. c. 15:

*Crupina Belgarum Nobis*. Centaurium Capitatum ciliare Names. annuum, fol laciniatis serratis H. Blef. 362. Chondrilla Hispanica Jonst. 287. F. 4. purpurascen e fl.

Ic.1. Senecio carduus Apulus Col. 32. Fig. c. 7.

It&#x27;s a pretty Annual Plant, with a purple Flower like Saw-wort, and shining smooth velvety Seeds, which on shutting them in your hand, are apt to slip or creep out, for which reason the Dutch call it Cruppen. It grows in Italy, Spain, Narbone, and about Mompelier,

Sicilian
Sicilian Milk-Thistle.

Carduus Siculus Acanthoides, venis albicantibus Nobis humilis alatus sive Carduus Mariae annuus, folio lituris obscuris notato Cupani Hort. Catholicici.

This resembles our English Gray Thistle, having many small purple Flowers and welted Stalks; its Leaves gray below but smooth above, and faintly veined with white. We are obliged to Father Cupani for the discovery of this Thistle. It Flowers with us from June till August: I have as yet seen it only in Chelsea Garden.

Great Globe Thistle. Ray 283. 1.

Echinopus Chabr. 351. Ic. 3. major I. B. 3. l. 25. p.69. F. Carduus Spherocephalus Dod. 722. Fig. Spher. latifolius vulg. C B. 380. 1. Spherocephalus seu Globosus major Park. 977 Ic. 2. Scabiosa Cardui folio Spherocephala elatior H. Leyd. 539.

Its Flowers of a pale yellow, the Leaves like the great Centaury, and its largeness distinguish it from others. Mr Ray observ&#x27;d this on the top of Thuiri on Mount Jura.

Teafell Scabious. Ray 378. 16. Var.

Scabiosa Virga Pastoris folio C B. 270. 6. Phyt. 527. 13. latifolia peregrina Tab. 160. Ic. 1. Hist. 547. Fig. 8.

The Flower of this is very like the common Scabious, both in Shape and Colour, but the Leaves whole and serrated like the Teafell. It Flowers in June.

Fine cut Sicilian Scabious. Ray 378. 13. Var.

Scabiosa maritima Rutæ Caninae folio Bocc. Pl. rar. 74. &amp; 95. Tab 40. &amp; 52.

Its lower Branches lie on the Ground, with Leaves deeply cut like the Scrophularia Rutæ Caninae folio, and still
Still finer on the Stalks; its Flowers pale, and sometimes blush. Found on the sandy Shores about Gaeta. The Revd. Mr Stonestreet, a curious Naturalist, gave me a Specimen of this, which he raised from Seed.

Valentia Fennel Tansy.

Caspar Bauhine gathered this in Tyrol, A.D. 1577: in place his Journey to Italy. Mr Ray observed it about Avignon and Aurange; it grows also in Spain. Flowers in June, Time July, &amp;c.

Smallage Laser-wort.

Laserpitium Apij folio.

Its Flowers are very small, and frequently at going off have but 2 bifid Petals like our Circe, the single Stalks of each Umbell have rarely more than 3 or 4 welted Seed on them, which ripen about July. The Leaves stiff and very like Smallage. Chelsea Garden is the only place in which I have seen this Plant.

Small Candy Sheaperds Needle. Ray 428. 2.

The Figure of the uppermost Cluster of Parkinson&#x27;s 9
sorts of Medica p. 116, very well resembles this Fruit,
but I have not as yet observed so many as he represents,
viz. 6 together. These Leaves are finely serrated; those
about the Root are some roundish, others broad, and
towards the uppart part pointed; the Fruit has about
6 twirls wholly smooth, and flat at each end, often sin-
gle; sometimes 2 or 3 together, rarely more. I am
obliged to Mr Jacob Bobart, Botannick Professor of the
Phylick Garden at Oxon, for the first Specimens of this
elegant Plant, who hath since sent its Seed to Chelsea,
where it now grows.

The peculiarity of this Clover is in having yellowish Flowers, especially when they first appear. Its Leaves plain, hairy, small; and round below, but above more pointed, standing on long hairy Stalks. It Flowers in June in Thickets and dry Pastures. Mr Ray first observ&#x27;d this about Geneva, and has since been found in England. Teasell headed Trefoil. Ray 945. xi. Pluk. Tab iii. F. 4.

Its Leaves stand on long Stalks, are not serrated, but soft and roundish; the Flowers flesh coloured, not large, each guarded with 2 pointed small green Leaves; these turn into 5 Star-pointed Burry heads like Eryngo or Teasell, but much smaller. Mr Johnson first discovered this the 10th of June 1633. in Dartford Salt Marsh. I have also gathered it about Tilbury Fort against Gravesend. Mr Ray observed it about Messina in Sicily, and Dr. Balam at Tangier.

From a single white Root it sends forth divers branch&#x27;d Stalks, in barren Places scarce a Span long, trailing on the Ground; but in fatter Soil much longer. Its Leaves dark, green, hairy and whole; those next the Root smaller, bluntish, and sometimes cordated; towards the top they are longer and pointed, standing on shorter footstalks. The Flowers small, Flesh coloured, and quickly Fade, growing at the ends of the Branches: These turn into hard thick set heads, in barren Ground roundish, in better
better Soil oval; they have always one, and sometimes
Leaves at each head, which when full ripe, are streakt,
hairy, and swell, each Husk ending in 5 little Thorns,
in which lies one large yellowish Seed. It grows in bar-
ren Pastures.

Its soft starry heads, with very long and limber rayes,
distinguish this from other Trefoils. It Flowers and Seeds
in April and May. Jonston says he saw this in Mr Tra-
descants Garden, flowering in May, who brought it from
Formentera, an isle in the Mediterranean near Ivica.
Mr Ray has observ&#x27;d it to grow plentifully at the foot of
Mount
Mount Vesuvius, as also about Messina and Mompelier. Mr Jezreel Jones gathered it about Lisbon, and Dr. Salvatore has sent it me from Barcelona.

It&#x27;s an elegant Shrub, with silver Leaves, and tufts of yellow Flowers at the tops of its Branches, which turn into smooth crooked Pods. The Heart of this is black like Ebony, and of it the Turks make Handles for their Sabres, and the Priests of Patmos turn them into Beads to pray with. Bartholomew Marantha found this on a certain Hill near Naples. Honorius Bellus observed it also
also in Rhodes, but more plentifully in a little Island near it call&#x27;d Astachida. Mr Ray saw it about Baia near Naples in Italy. In our Gardens it Flowers in June, and bears Pods towards Autumn.

This rare Plant was first Figured and Described in the
French Edition of the Hist. Lugdunensis, but omitted in
the Latine. It grows on the Mountain Veduxo called
Sierras albas or Puerto de Veduxo, facing the North,
where it Flowers in May and June. Dr. Plukenet first
Observed it in Mr. Charles du Bois his very Curious Gar-
den at Mitcham, and has Figured the upper part of the
Plant only, with auriculate Leaves, which the Hist. Lugd.
has erroneously made whole; which only are so at the
Root, round and serrated like the Cacalia, but those on
the Stalk are auriculated, as I have since observed it in
the Physick Garden at Chelsea, when in Flower and
Seed.

The Flowers are stellated, small, of a greenish yellow, growing in Clusters amongst the Leaves, which are serrated like the Jujube. Its Fruit is hard and somewhat Bell-fashioned, including 3 Kernels, which rattle in the Cells when ripe. It grows in the Hedges and Fields about Montpelier, and several Parts of Italy, where it Flowers in May and June, and bears ripe Fruit in the Autumn, which hangs on the Trees all Winter. Petrus Bellonius, who travell’d over the Holyland, says it was with this Thorn they crowned our Saviour, and gives this Reason for it; That in Judea there was not any Thorn so fit, pliant and prickly as this, and that in those parts it grew in so great abundance, that they burn it for Fuel, as we do our Grass or Furze.

This makes a pretty Shew in Hedges, especially in the Autumn and towards Winter, when its red Husks open, and expose its Orange Kernels.

Broad, purple flowred Spindle Tree.

Euonymus latifolius, fl. purpurco Nobis.

This rare Tree seems to differ from both the Hungarian sorts of Clusius, the broad leaved, like this, having white or flesh Coloured Flowers, and the Leaves of the Purple flowred resemble our Common. I saw this in Flower with great Pleasure in the Bishop of London’s Garden at Fulham.

It bears Tufts of very small pentapetalose blush Flowers, which when ripe, turn white. It grows plentifully on the Sea Coasts near Montpelier. The famous Dr Grindall, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the first that caused this Tree to be brought into England, he being relieved of a great Oppretion and hardness of the Spleen, by the use of it.

German Tamarisk. Ray 1705. 2.

A Sarum Canadense Cornuti 25 c. xi. Fig. Asarum Americanum Park. 226. Fig. Asarum Americanum majus Virid. var. 94. Vallot H. Reg. Paris. 25.

This is larger in all its Parts than the Common, its Leaves somewhat pointed and Velvetey. It flourishes very well in the Bishop of Londons Garden at Fulham, where I have seen it in Flower. Grows wild both in Place. Virginia and Canada.

Pellitory Pill-Nettle. Ray 161. 7. 82

Urtica Pilulifera altera, Parietariae folijs Dodart. Mem. Names. 131 Fig. Urtica Romana altera mitior, foliis minus serratis, Lini semine Jonquet Hort. Reg. Paris 138. Urtica urens altera Pilulifera, Parietariae folijs Vallot 187.

This differs from the Roman Nettle, in having lesser Leaves, and those rarely serrated. Many Gardiners call this Plant Spanish Majoram, inducing unwary People to sting their Noses by smelling to it.

Great Canada Nettle. Ray 1854. 8. 83

Urticaracemosa Canadensis maxima Dodart Mem. 120. Names. Fig. Urtica iners maxima Canad. Joncq. 138. Urtica max. racemosa Canadensis Vallot. 187.

The Leaves of this stand on longer Footstalks, are of a deeper green, and not pungent as the Common Nettle.

This is much taller, larger and more spread than the Common, its Burs also bigger. I have observed this in the Bishop of London&#x27;s Garden at Fulham.

**Egyptian Groundsel with Fetherfew Leaves.**

*Senecio *Egyptiacus*, fol. *Metricariae Boerhave Ind. Plant.* H. Leyd. 40. 2.

The Leaves are large and smooth, but the Flowers small, which appear from July till Autumn. We are obliged to Dr Boerhave, Botanick Professor at Leyden, for the Seed and first discovery of this Plant.

**Athenian Groundsel.** Ray 3. p. 183, pl. 3.

*Senecio Atticus vulgaris similis, flore petalis fere inconspicuis radiato Pluket. Almagest. Botan. 342.*

These Leaves are very hoary, like our Sweet Groundsel, but larger and more clammy; the Flowers also are scarce radiated. The Reverend Sir George Wheeler first observ&#x27;d this Plant about Athens, and communicated Seed of it to our Gardens.

**Cockle-Flowered Oriental Scabious.**

*Scabiosa Orientalis Pseudo-melanthis flore.*

The Peculiarity of this Plant lies in the Flower, whose Rim is composed of broad, flat, red Petals resembling the Cockle, with much less, narrower and pipey Leaves in the middle. It Flowers from May till towards Autumn.

**White Oriental Scabious** with differing Leaves:

*Scabiosa Orientalis folijs biformibus, fl. albo Nobis argentea minor Wheeler 239. 2. Scabiosa Orient. argentea folijs inferioribus incisis T. Coral. 34.*

The Leaves next the Root are whitish and jagged like the Small Field Scabiose, those towards the top very narrow, mostly whole and pale; the Flowers white with broad Rims, like the Cockle flowered, but smaller and trifid; its Heads composed of long stiff Hairs resembling those of Aven. This elegant Plant was first discover&#x27;d by Sir George Wheeler on Mount Sipylus. My very worthy Friend Mr Jacob Bobart at Oxford, sent me the first Speci-
Specimen of this, since which I have observed it with Mr Thomas Fairchild at Hoxton, and in Chelsey Garden, flourishing in July, August, &amp;c.

Yellow hoary Cape Camomil. Ray 356. 9.

Chamaemelum Ethiopicum lanuginosum Breyn. Cent. 73. Fig. Cotula Africana capite elegantissimo I. R. H. 494.

Its Leaves are very fine resembling Dogs Chamomil, the Character. Flowers yellow, with a small short Rim standing in a pretty glaucous Funnel-like Calix. I first observed this Place in the Physick Gardens at Leyden and Amsterdam, and since at Chelsey, Flowering in July and August.

Dwarf Oriental Fennel-Tansy.

Coma Orientalis pumila Nobis. Chamaemelum marinum Astaticum nudum humifusum, folio crasso Boerhavse Ind. Plant. H. Leyd. 36. 8.

This chiefly differs from the Valentia Fennel-Tansy in Character, being much less.

I first received this elegant Plant from that curious Place: Botanist Mons. Sebastian Vaillant at Paris, and her Grace the Dutchess Domager of Beaufort hath since sent it me from Badmington: I saw it the last Summer in Flower with her at Chelsey, as also in our Physick Garden.

Hoary Milfoil-Maudlin.

Ageratum Orient. folio Millefolii tomentoso Nobis. Names. an Millefolium Tomentosissimum Boerhavse p. 38. 8.

The lower Leaves are hoary, very long and finely cut, Description not much unlike a Herring Bone, its Flower tuft before they open; are very close, broad and white, but when
full blown, of a bright yellow, like the hoary Tarrow of that Colour, but without Rims. It flowers in Chelsey Garden from July till September.

Leonard Rawolph was the first, since Dioscorides, who discovered this elegant Plant on the Precipices of the famous Mount Lebanon. We are much obliged to that Curious Botanist Dr William Sherrard Consul of Smyrna for this Plant, which I first saw in Flower and Seed with Mr Thomas Fairchild Gardener at Hoxton, and since with Mr Charles du Bois at Mitcham.

Yellow Clammy Oriental Tournsole.

Heliotropium Orient. procumbens viscosum fl. luteo Nobis. Buglosium Orient. fl. luteo T. Cor. 6.

The Root-Leaves are long, broad, and very clammy, as are its Branches, which spread on the Ground and end in reflex Spikes of yellow Flowers. We are oblig&#x27;d to Dr Sherrard for Seeds of this Plant, which flowers in Chelsey Garden the greatest part of the Summer.

Brasil broad Borrage-Tournsole. Ray 502. 5.

This elegant Plant grows about a Yard high, with large opposite Clary like Leaves; at the end of the Branches rise long slender Spikes of small blueish Flowers, which turn backwards like our Common Scorpion Grass.

Barbadoes Spikenard.

Citrago Barbadiensis folio Melissæ majore.
Its middle Stalks grow near a hand high, are four Square, with large opposite Balm Leaves of a pale green, more lacerated or torn then serrated, standing on long slender Footstalks. Its Flowers come from the Bosom of the Leaves, especially at the bottom, they are small and Mosley like those of Nettles. This curious Plant flowered the last Summer in Chelsey Garden, which is the only Place where I have as yet seen it.

Cape Hour Mallow. Ray 1667. 8.

Alcea Vesicaria Capitis Bone Spei H.Ox.533. 12. Alcea Vesicaria Æthiopica Munting. Phytograph. Curiosa Tab. 72. Fig.

This differs from the Common, in having a firm upright Stalk; its Leaves rounder, broader and smoother; the Flowers finer, larger and a blacker bottom; the Seed less. Munting has given a very accurate Figure of this Plant.

Round leaved Virginia Crowfoot.

Ranunculus auricomus Virginianus Jac. Bobart. Ranunculus Virginianus parvo flore, molliori folio Herm. H. Leyd. 514.

Its lower Leaves are round, limber and serrated like our Alliaria, or Sawce alone, the Flowers scarce discernible, and Seed heads very small. Dr Herman owns to have received this from Mr Jacob Boerart: I first saw it in the Leyden Garden with Dr Boerhave, who hath since sent it to Chelsey.

Piked Strawberry-Trefoil.

Trifolium Orientale, capitulo velicario rigido.

The Leaves are oval, smooth, and lightly crenated; its Heads round, with stiff long Points, standing out of streaked, whitish, bladder-like Husks. I observed this elegant Plant in Chelsey Garden.

Round Husey Haresfoot.

Trifolium Lagopoides procumbens, capitulis rotundis G. Stonestreet. an Trifolium Orientale, capite lanuginoso T. Coral.
The Leaves are small, oval, plain and somewhat hairy; the lesser Branches, which adhere to the greater Stalks, are bearded; its blush Flowers stand in a round flutey Head, like our Haresfoot, but not so soft. The Reverend Mr William Stonestreet, that sagacious Naturalist, gave me a Specimen of this, which he had raised in Mr Fairchild&#x27;s Garden at Hoxton from Seed he received from Dr William Sherrard Consul at Smyrna.

It bears four Leaves on a two Inch hairy Footstalk, with two long welted Beards at setting on. The Peculiarity of this strange Plant is to ripen its Pods under Ground; the Pease are much eaten both in Guiney and the American Isles; it grows also in the East Indies. It was raised the last Summer in Chelsey Garden.

China Pink.

Caryophyllus Sinensis, flore pulcherrimo Boerhav. 88. 23.

This elegant Plant has single Flowers with a large dark Eye or Ring towards the bottom; its Leaves not unlike the other Pinks. I saw it in Flower the last Summer with Mr Fairchild at Hoxton.

Cape Tree-Cranesbill with roundish circled Leaves.

Geranium African. arborescens, Alchimilla hirsuto folio, floribus rubicundis Comel. praedud. 1.p.51. Fig. Ray App. 3. 229. 1.

This rises three or four Foot high from a round hairy Stem, which divides into so many Branches; its Leaves soft and roundish, with a dark Circle in the midst; these if lightly rubbed, smell very pleasantly like Codlings and Creams; it bears Tufts of blush Flowers, with equal Petals,
Petals, the two uppermost only streakt with red. This is cultivated in most of the curious Gardens about London, viz. with the Duchess of Beaufort, Bishop of London, Dr Uvedal, Mr du Bois, &amp;c. It flowers most part of the Summer, especially from Midsummer till Autumn.

Boerhave&#x27;s Cape Cranes bill, with small roundish circled Leaves.

Geranium African. folio Alchimillæ piloso, maculato Boerhave Ind. Plant. Leyd. 112. pl. 52.

This is a low Plant, with dark Circles and roundith Leaves like the last, but more indented, yet not so deep and hairy as the Ladies-Mantle Cranes-bill of Dr. Herman; its Flowers are also smaller than that and all white, the Petals whole, and of one size. I observ&#x27;d this in Chelsea Garden, flowering in August.

Cape Cranes-bill with round and angular, thick, fower Leaves.

Geranium African. Hederae arboreæ folio, floribus purpureis Ray 3. p. 514. pl. 38. Geranium Africanum, folijs inferioribus Asari, superioribus Staphydisagriæ, maculatis &amp; splendentibus, Acetose sapore Comel. prelud. 1. p. 52. fig. Ray 3. App. 228. 2.

This is a spreading low Plant, with shining, thick, juicy, tart, round umbrella Leaves; those towards the Flowers are angular and pointed: Its Tassel-Flowers are large, of a blush colour; the Petals all of the same size, and the two uppermost streak&#x27;d with red. It flourishes most part of the Year at Chelsea, Fulham, Enfield, &amp;c. It grows wild in the Districts of Heycoon at the Cape of Good Hope.

Yellow African Bean-Caper.

Falugo Africana arborescens, flore Sulphureo, fructu rotundo Comel. Pl. rar. 10. Fig.
Its Leaves are small, thick, green, and 4 together, viz. two on each side the Stalk, with as many little Spines at setting on; from these come 5 leaved yellow Flowers, with a round flatish Husk, which splits into 5 Cells, containing so many Seed. I have with great pleasure seen this rare Shrub between 2 and 3 yards high, and in Flower, with her Grace the Dutchess Dowager of Beaufort, now at Chelsea.

Virginia Spindle-tree with rough Fruit.

Euonymus Virginianus Pyracantha folijs, capsula verrucarum instar asperata rubente Pluk. Tab. 115. Fig. 1. Alm. Botan. 139. pl. 8.

The Leaves are small, stiff, and serrated, not unlike the Sloe. I have seen this with ripe Fruit at the Bishop of London&#x27;s at Fulham, under the Care of Mr. Millward, my Lord&#x27;s Gardner, where it now grows larger than a Currant Bush.

Steerbecks Cape Spindelkin.

Euonymo adfinis Æthiopica semper virens, fructu globoso scabro, folijs Salicis rigidis serratis Herm. H. Leyd. 139. Pluk. Tab. 176. Fig. 3. Alm. Botan. 129. pl. 11. Laurus non odorata, fructu globoso, Africana Steerb. Citricult. 248. Lauro ferratae odoratae Stapelianæ similis indora Capitis Bone Spec Breyn. Prodr. 1. p. 42.

This Tree bears Tufts of small five-leaved pale greenish Flowers, coming from the Bottom of its Leaves, which are stiff, long and serrated. I saw a specious Tree of this in the Queens Stows at Hampton Court, under the Care of Mr Wise, Her Majesty&#x27;s Gardiner, Flowring in July, &amp;c.
