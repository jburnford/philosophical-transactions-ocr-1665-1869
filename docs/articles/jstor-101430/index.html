<div class="ocr-text">which, if perhaps it should be found out by you (which I can hardly believe it will) in this case the Church will not at all scruple to declare, that these places are to be understood in a figurative and improper sense, according to that of the Poet, Terræque Urbæque recedunt.

Whence this Author concludes, that the said Jesuite assuring us that the inquisition hath not absolutely declared, that those Scripture places are to be understood literally, seeing that the Church may make a contrary declaration, no man ought to scruple to follow the Hypothesis of the Earth&#x27;s motion, but only forbear to maintain it in publick, till the prohibition be called in. But to return to the matter in hand, this Author, upon all these observations and relations of Cassini and Campani, doth find no reason to doubt any more of the excellency of the Glasses used by them, above his; except this difference may be imputed to that of the Air, or of the Eyes. But yet he is rather inclined to ascribe it to the goodness of their Glasses, and that the rather, because, he would not be thought to have the vanity of magnifying his own; of which, yet he intimates by the by, that he caused one to be wrought, of 150 Parisian feet; which though it proved none of the best, yet he despairs not to make good ones of that, and of far greater Length.

Signor Campani&#x27;s Answer: and Monsieur Auzout&#x27;s Animadversions thereon.

The other part of this French Tract, containing Campani&#x27;s Answer, and Mr. Auzout his Reflections thereon, begins with the pretended Shadows of the Ring upon Saturn, and of Saturn upon the Ring. Concerning which, the said Campani declareth, that he never believed them to be shadows made by the Ring upon the Disk of Saturn, or by the body of Saturn upon the Ring, but the Rims of these bodies, which being unequally Luminous, did shew these appearances. In which Explication, forasmuch as it represents, that the said Campani meant to note only the Inequality of the Light, which, he saith, his Glasses did discover, Mr. Auzout does
so far acquiesce, that he only wishes, that his own Glasses would shew him those differences. Next to the Objection, made by Monsieur Auzout, against Signor Campani, touching the Proportion of the Length of the Ring to its breadth, Campani replyeth, that the Glasses of Monsieur Auzout shew not all the particulars, that his do, and therefore are unfit for determining the true Figure and breadth of the apparent Ellipsis of the Ring. To which M. Auzout rejoyns, that he is displeased at his being destitute of better Glasses; but that it will be very hard for the future to convince Campani touching the Proportion of the Ring, seeing that the breadth of the Ellipsis is always diminishing, although, if the declination of the Ring remains always the same, one can at all times know, which may have been its greatest breadth. But he assures, that the breadth of the Ring is not the half of its length, and that it doth not spread out so much beyond Saturn&#x27;s Body, as he hath alleged. And withal desires to know, what can be answered by Sig. Campani to M. Hugens, who being persuaded, that the Declination of the Ring is not above 23 deg. 30&#x27; having seen the Ring to spread out above the Body of Saturn, concludes, in a Letter to M. Auzout, that the length of the Ring is more than treble the Diameter of Saturn&#x27;s body, which, according to Campani, is only as about 67 to 31. Which difference yet does not appear to M. Auzout to be so great; but that M. Hugens perhaps will impute it to the Optical reason, which he (Auzout) hath alleged of the Advance of the light upon the obscure space; although he is of Opinion, he should not have concluded so great a Length, if he had not seen the Breadth spread out more, than he hath done: for (faith he) if the Length of the Ring be to the body of Saturn, as 2½ to 1, and the Inclination be 23 deg. 30&#x27;, the Ring will be just as large, as the body, without spreading out; but if the Ring be bigger, it will a little spread out; and if it were treble, it must needs spread out the half of its breadth, which hath not so appeared to him.

Further, to M. Auzout&#x27;s change of Opinion, and believing, that the Advance or Sally, seen by him in Jupiter, was the shadow of one of his Moons, Campani declares, that he would not have him guilty of that change: Whereupon M. Auzout wonders, why Campani then hath not marked it in his Figure; and would gladly
ly know, whether that Sally be more easie to discover, than the shadows of the satellites, which Campani believes, August hath not seen; and whether he be assured, that those obscure parts, which he there distinguishes, do not change: for if they should not change, then Jupiter would not turn about his Axis, which yet, he faith, it doth, according to the Observation made by Mr. Hook, May 9 1664. inserted in the first papers of these Transactions.

The full Discovery of which particular also he makes to be a part of Cassini&#x27;s and Campani&#x27;s work, seeing that they so distinctly see the inequalities in the Belts, and see also sometimes other spots besides the shadows of the Satellites: where he exhorts all the Curious, that have the conveniency of observing, to endeavor the discovery of a matter of that importance, which would prove one of the greatest Analogies for the Earth&#x27;s Motion.

An Account of Mr. Richard Lower&#x27;s newly published Vindication of Doctor Willis&#x27;s Diatriba de Febribus.

The Title of this Curious piece, is, Diatriba Thesae Willisi Med. Doct. &amp; Profess. Oxon. De Febribus Vindicatio, Authore Richardo Lower, &amp;c. In it are occasionally discussed many considerable Medical and Anatomical inquiries, as, Whether a Fever does consist in an Effervescence of Blood? And if so, of what kind? Whether there be a Nervous and Nutritious Juice? Whether the office of sanguification belongs to the Blood itself, existing before those Viscera (at least) that are commonly esteemed to be the Organs of sanguification? How Nutrition is performed, and the nourishing substance assimilated? Whether the Blood affords both the Matter for the structure of the Body, and such parts also, as are fit for the nourishment of the same? Whether the Pulse of the Heart ceasing, there remains yet a certain Motion in the blood, arguing, that Pulse and Life do ultimately rest in the Blood? Whether the Umbilical Vessels convey the blood of the Mother to the Child, or whether the Fetus be for the most part form&#x27;d and</div>
