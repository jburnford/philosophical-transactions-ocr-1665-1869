IX. An Account of a Fetus, voided by the Ulcered Navil of a Negro in Nevis, by Mr. James Brodie; Communicated by Dr. Preston.

SIR,

IN the Island of Nevis, in the West-Indies, there was a Negro Woman belonging to one Captain Mead, who after one Year and halfs being with Child, was at the last, to a wonder relieved by the Navil, in this manner; about the 17th Month, the Woman being believed to be Hydropical, by reason of her passing her time so far, and of the great swelling of her Belly. Her Navil did begin to Swell and Impostumate, so that most People did believe she would dye by that. It did Tumifie and grow livid, so that the Surgeon was unwilling to meddle with it; but by reason of the Importunity of the Master of the Woman, who was willing to try all ways to save her Life, he was coming to open it, but in that time it did break of it self, and void some quantity of Ichorous Matter, and then leave off, but the Woman had some ease by it then;
in about a Month more it did Impostumate again, to a far greater degree than before, whereupon, the Surgeon being sent for, he, where it did seem most Jetting out, which was the Navil itself, did lay it open with a large Lancet; and then, after voiding a great deal of thin Ichor and Matter, there did appear some Bones, which did startle him, not having seen the like before, and it did prove to be a Child, that the Flesh was decayed from, the which did stink much; but after the Extraction of the Bones, the Woman was easie, and in a little time the Woman did begin to Recover, she being very low, by reason of the great Burthen she had carried for a long time: She is now Recovered, and was alive about six Months ago, when I was in Nevis; and I was told by the Surgeon and several others, that she hath had a Child since, this can be asserted by several Persons of quality of that Island that are in Town, who have seen the Woman. This is all I can say of it at present, till my return to the West Indies, when, if any one desire to know more of it, I shall give them a larger account. This, Sir, is what I can say to what you did desire. I am

Yours, &amp;c.
