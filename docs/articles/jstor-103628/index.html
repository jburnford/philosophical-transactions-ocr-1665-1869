<div class="ocr-text">III. Observations upon dissecting the Body of a Person troubled with the Stone. By Dr. Perrot Williams, Physician at Haverford-West in South-Wales.

Mr. William Bowen of the Town and County of Haverford-West, aged between 40 and 50, having been, for about the Space of seven Years, severely afflicted with the usual Symptoms of the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder, viz. Bloody Urine after Exercise, Strangury, &amp;c. Dy&#x27;d in May 1722. His Body being opened, there were found in the Bladder six smooth oval Stones, exactly of the same Figure, and nearly of the same Magnitude: There were also three Cells in each Kidney, the Figure of each suitable to that of the Stones: The Ureters were so preternaturally extended, as very easily to admit the largest of the Stones to pass from the Kidney to the Bladder. The Viscera, &amp;c. appear&#x27;d in their natural State.</div>
