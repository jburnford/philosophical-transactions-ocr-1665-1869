Mr. John Catlin had a few Days before deliver&#x27;d me a Computation of this Eclipse, corrected from two Places of the Moon, observ&#x27;d the 28th of February and the 2d of March 1729, corresponding pretty nearly with her present Situation; as likewise from the Star&#x27;s Position, as I had rectify&#x27;d it from several late Observations; and this gave the

VI. An Observation of an uncommon Gleam of Light proceeding from the Sun, by Mr. Peter Collinson F. R. S.

Read March 19.

On the 8th of March 1746-7, near 1746-7.

8 o&#x27;Clock in the Morning, as I was riding within three Miles of Brentwood in Essex, there appeared a singular Phænomenon in the Heavens; the Sketch (Tab. . Fig. .) may give some Idea of it.

The Morning was fine and clear, the Sun shone bright, no Cloud to be seen, but the Air a little hazy: Where the Phænomenon appeared, which was a bright cloudy Spot, seem&#x27;d a very small Portion of a Rainbow,
a Rainbow, only the Colours very faint. It was in a horizontal Direction North of the Sun, and from it projected a long luminous Ray, which terminated in a Point.—It continu&#x27;d very strong for more than half an Hour after I saw it, and then vanish&#x27;d away by degrees.

P. Collinson.

VII. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Benjamin Cooke F.R.S. to Mr. Peter Collinson F.R.S. concerning the Property of new Flanel sparkling in the dark.

Newport, Isle of Wight, Jan. 13. 1746-7.

Read March 19. Since I have read the Transaction 1746-7. N°. 476. with respect to the sparkling Lady, who could communicate a kind of electrical Fire to her Garments, I can give you an Instance nearly like it, of a Lady who was surprised at such an Appearance from a Flanel Petticoat, which she happen&#x27;d to shake in the dark. But at last we found, that new Flanel, after some time wearing, would acquire this Property; but that it lost it by being washed.</div>
