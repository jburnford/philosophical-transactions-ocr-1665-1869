XII. An Account of an Earthquake at Scarborough, on Dec. 29. 1737. communicated in a Letter from Maurice Johnson, Esq; jun. Secr. of the Gentlemens Society at Spalding, to C. Mortimer, M.D. Secr. R.S.

*SIR,*  
Spalding, Jan. 7. 1737-8.

SINCE I last did myself the Honour of writing to you, nothing, I think, worth communicating to you for the Royal Society, in the philosophical Way, has occurred to us here, until last Thursday, when the following Account of an Earthquake, which has very lately happened at Scarborough, as sent in a Letter from an Eye-witness, to a Gentleman here, was
was read, dated thence the 30th of December 1737.

in these Words:

&quot;The Ends of several Inclosures or Fields
behind the Clift, on the Back of the Spaw, sunk
down very low into the Ground, making a large
Valley of a vast Length, and considerable Breadth,
with Five Cows then grazing on it (which they
got out this Morning), the Weight of which shook
and opened the Hill behind the House, after a
frightful Manner, and forced up the Sands an hun-
dred Yards in Length on each Side the Space, and
Twenty-seven broad, to the Height of Six Yards,
and in some Places Ten Yards high.

The Pier, intire as it was, moved sideways out
of its Place, and rose up about Five Yards in the
Air; the House fell down, and at the same time
took Fire.

The Flag-house, and wooden Rails, which were
about the Mouth of the Well, were forced up in
the Air above Ten Yards high, so that it is thought
the Spaw-water is intirely lost for ever *.

The Tide was out when this happened, and I
was walking on the Spaw till after 12 o’Clock,
when I saw the Sands beginning to rise about half
a Foot: There were but few People there then,
but in less than Two Hours the Sands were covered
with Men, Women and Children, to see the Sands
and Pier rise gradually; which they began to do
about 12 o’Clock Yesterday Noon, and were at the
Height I mention before it was dark, and continues
so now.

* N.B. The Spaw was soon after recovered as good as before.
&quot;Nobody came by any Hurt, the People of the House getting away in Time; but all Dickey&#x27;s* Household-goods are lost, with a Cellar well stocked with Wine and Ale.&quot;

Now, Sir, though this Representation be not altogether so accurate, in every Part of the Relation, as we could have wished; yet coming from an Eye-witness, and who happened to observe it from the first Motion, and is esteemed a Person of Fidelity, we thought it might not be unacceptable to the Royal Society, and to you, Sir, and which, if the most learned and worthy President judge proper, you may be pleased to communicate to that Learned and Illustrious Body, with our most humble Services. I am,

Your most obedient,
and obliged humble Servant,

Maur. Johnson, jun.
