his Book) wou&#x27;d serve to breathe 8 ½ Minutes when
it was entirely dry, and the Diaphragms impregnated
with Salt of Tartar. 2. That Leaves imbibe Air,
as he has since tried in Mint in the manner that he
mention&#x27;d (in Page 329.) 3. That this year the
Heat of the Weather has been at 84 Degrees,
mark&#x27;d on his Thermometers.

that Transaction by them, to cancel from the Words, Lastly, Let us
suppose, Page 280. Lin. ult. to the End of the Paragraph.
