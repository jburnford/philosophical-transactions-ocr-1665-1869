The Committee appointed by the Royal Society to direct the publication of the Philosophical Transactions, take this opportunity to acquaint the Public, that it fully appears, as well from the Council-books and Journals of the Society, as from repeated declarations which have been made in several former Transactions, that the printing of them was always, from time to time, the single act of the respective Secretaries till the Forty-seventh Volume; the Society, as a Body, never interesting themselves any further in their publication, than by occasionally recommending the revival of them to some of their Secretaries, when, from the particular circumstances of their affairs, the Transactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted. And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued.

But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable that a Committee of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752. And the grounds of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgement of their respective authors.

It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body,
upon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore
the thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors
of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through
whose hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a
matter of civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communi-
cations. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions,
and curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors
whereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report and even to
certify in the public newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and
approbation. And therefore it is hoped that no regard will hereafter be paid to such
reports and public notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited,
to the dishonour of the Society.

The Meteorological Journal hitherto kept by the Assistant Secretary at the Apart-
ments of the Royal Society, by order of the President and Council, and published in
the Philosophical Transactions, has been discontinued. The Government, on the
recommendation of the President and Council, has established at the Royal Obser-
vatory at Greenwich, under the superintendence of the Astronomer Royal, a Magnet-
ical and Meteorological Observatory, where observations are made on an extended
scale, which are regularly published. These, which correspond with the grand
scheme of observations now carrying out in different parts of the globe, supersede
the necessity of a continuance of the observations made at the Apartments of the
Royal Society, which could not be rendered so perfect as was desirable, on account
of the imperfections of the locality and the multiplied duties of the observer.

ROYAL MEDALS.

HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA, in restoring the Foundation of the Royal Medals, has been graciously pleased to approve the following regulations for the award of them:

That the Royal Medals be given for such papers only as have been presented to the Royal Society, and inserted in their Transactions.

That the triennial Cycle of subjects be the same as that hitherto in operation: viz.
1. Astronomy; Physiology, including the Natural History of Organized Beings.
2. Physics; Geology or Mineralogy.
3. Mathematics; Chemistry.

That, in case no paper, coming within these stipulations, should be considered deserving of the Royal Medal, in any given year, the Council have the power of awarding such Medal to the author of any other paper on either of the several subjects forming the Cycle, that may have been presented to the Society and inserted in their Transactions; preference being given to the subjects of the year immediately preceding: the award being, in such case, subject to the approbation of Her Majesty.

The Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1847 for the most important unpublished paper in Mathematics, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1844, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1847.

The Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1847 for the most important unpublished paper in Chemistry, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1844, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1847.
The Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1848 for the most important unpublished paper in Astronomy, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1845, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1848.

The Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1848 for the most important unpublished paper in Physiology, including the Natural History of Organized Beings, communicated to the Royal Society for insertion in their Transactions after the termination of the Session in June 1845, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1848.

The Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1849 for the most important paper in Physics, communicated to the Royal Society after the termination of the Session in June 1845, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1848, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions.

The Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1849 for the most important paper in Geology or Mineralogy, communicated to the Royal Society after the termination of the Session in June 1845, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1848, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions.

The Council propose to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1850 for the most important paper in Mathematics, communicated to the Royal Society after the termination of the Session in June 1846, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1849, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions.

The Council propose also to give one of the Royal Medals in the year 1850 for the most important paper in Chemistry, communicated to the Royal Society after the termination of the Session in June 1846, and prior to the termination of the Session in June 1849, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions.
