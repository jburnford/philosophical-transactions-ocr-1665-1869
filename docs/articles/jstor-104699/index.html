<div class="ocr-text">meters, have thought the 11th of June 1748 was hotter: But I imagine the Reason to be, that the Heat this Year came on gradually from Day to Day; whereas in the Year 1748 it was much more sudden; the Thermometer then rising 22 Degrees more in one Day than the preceding; which, consequently, would make the Difference between one Day and another appear the more extraordinary. But, by my Observations on the 11th of June 1748, Hauksbee&#x27;s Thermometer stood at $14\frac{1}{2}$; full 6 Degrees cooler than on the 11th of this present July. I am,

The Moon was now got so low, and Day-light so far advanced, that no more Phases could be observed with any Degree of Certainty.

These Observations were made with a reflecting Telescope, that magnified 40 times, and a refracting Telescope, which magnified 12 times; and the Times were the same thro&#x27; these two Telescopes; for the Air was exceeding clear, and the Shadow well defined, the *Penumbra* being scarce sensible.
Here follows a Computation, made from Dr. Halley&#x27;s Tables, by Mr. John Catlin, of Guy&#x27;s Hospital; and sent to Mr. Short the Day before the Eclipse.

Dec. 1. in the Morning 1750.

Beginning of the Moon&#x27;s Eclipse . 16 44 31
Immersion at . . . 17 42 45
Emersion at . . . 19 20 37
End at . . . 20 18 51

From hence it appears, that the Eclipse began about 8 Minutes sooner than the Computation from Dr. Halley&#x27;s Tables gave it; but the Computation which Mr. Brent made and published some time before the Eclipse happen&#x27;d, was within a Minute of the Time observed; and this Exactness he imputes to his leaving out three of the seven Equations of the Moon, published by Sir Isaac Newton in his Theory of the Moon.</div>
