<div class="ocr-text">III. On the Nature and Construction of the Sun and fixed Stars.

By William Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S.

Read December 18, 1794.

Among the celestial bodies the sun is certainly the first which should attract our notice. It is a fountain of light that illuminates the world! it is the cause of that heat which maintains the productive power of nature, and makes the earth a fit habitation for man! it is the central body of the planetary system; and what renders a knowledge of its nature still more interesting to us is, that the numberless stars which compose the universe, appear, by the strictest analogy, to be similar bodies. Their innate light is so intense, that it reaches the eye of the observer from the remotest regions of space, and forcibly claims his notice.

Now, if we are convinced that an inquiry into the nature and properties of the sun is highly worthy of our notice, we may also with great satisfaction reflect on the considerable progress that has already been made in our knowledge of this eminent body. It would require a long detail to enumerate all the various discoveries which have been made on this subject; I shall, therefore, content myself with giving only the most capital of them.

Sir Isaac Newton has shewn that the sun, by its attractive power, retains the planets of our system in their orbits. He
has also pointed out the method whereby the quantity of matter it contains may be accurately determined. Dr. Brad-
ley has assigned the velocity of the solar light with a degree of precision exceeding our utmost expectation. Galileo,
Scheiner, Hevelius, Cassini, and others, have ascertained the rotation of the sun upon its axis, and determined the position of its equator. By means of the transit of Venus over the disc of the sun, our mathematicians have calculated its distance from the earth; its real diameter and magnitude; the density of the matter of which it is composed; and the fall of heavy bodies on its surface.

From the particulars here enumerated, it is sufficiently ob-
vious, that we have already a very clear idea of the vast im-
portance, and powerful influence of the sun on its planetary system. And if we add to this the beneficent effects we feel on this globe from the diffusion of the solar rays; and consider that, by well traced analogies, the same effects have been proved to take place on other planets of this system; I should not wonder if we were induced to think that nothing remained to be added in order to complete our knowledge: and yet it will not be difficult to shew that we are still very ignorant, at least with regard to the internal construction of the sun. The various conjectures, which have been formed on this subject, are evident marks of the uncertainty under which we have hitherto laboured.

The dark spots in the sun, for instance, have been supposed to be solid bodies revolving very near its surface. They have been conjectured to be the smoke of volcanoes, or the scum floating upon an ocean of fluid matter. They have also been taken for clouds. They were explained to be opaque masses,
swimming in the fluid matter of the sun; dipping down occasionally. It has been supposed that a fiery liquid surrounded the sun, and that, by its ebbing and flowing, the highest parts of it were occasionally uncovered, and appeared under the shape of dark spots; and that, by the return of this fiery liquid, they were again covered, and in that manner successively assumed different phases. The sun itself has been called a globe of fire, though perhaps metaphorically. The waste it would undergo by a gradual consumption, on the supposition of its being ignited, has been ingeniously calculated. And in the same point of view, its immense power of heating the bodies of such comets as draw very near to it has been assigned.

The bright spots, or faculae, have been called clouds of light, and luminous vapours. The light of the sun itself has been supposed to be directly invisible, and not to be perceived unless by reflection; though the proofs, which are brought in support of that opinion, seem to me to amount to no more than, what is sufficiently evident, that we cannot see when rays of light do not enter the eye.

But it is time to profit by the many valuable observations that we are now in possession of. A list of successive eminent astronomers may be named, from Galileo down to the present time; who have furnished us with materials for examination.

In supporting the ideas I shall propose in this paper, with regard to the physical construction of the sun, I have availed myself of the labours of all these astronomers, but have been induced thereto only by my own actual observation of the solar phænomena; which, besides verifying those particulars that had been already observed, gave me such views of the
solar regions as led to the foundation of a very rational system. For, having the advantage of former observations, my latest reviews of the body of the sun were immediately directed to the most essential points; and the work was by this means facilitated, and contracted into a pretty narrow compass.

The following is a short extract of my observations on the sun, to which I have joined the consequences I now believe myself entitled to draw from them. When all the reasonings on the several phænomena are put together, and a few additional arguments, taken from analogy, which I shall also add, are properly considered, it will be found that a general conclusion may be made which seems to throw a considerable light upon our present subject.

In the year 1779, there was a spot on the sun which was large enough to be seen with the naked eye. By a view of it with a 7-feet reflector, charged with a very high power, it appeared to be divided into two parts. The largest of the two, on the 19th of April, measured $1&#x27;8&#x27;&#x27;$,06 in diameter; which is equal, in length, to more than 31 thousand miles. Both together must certainly have extended above 50 thousand.

The idea of its being occasioned by a volcanic explosion, violently driving away a fiery fluid, which on its return would gradually fill up the vacancy, and thus restore the sun, in that place, to its former splendour, ought to be rejected on many accounts. To mention only one, the great extent of the spot is very unfavourable to that supposition. Indeed a much less violent and less pernicious cause may be assigned, to account for all the appearances of the spot. When we see a dark belt near the equator of the planet Jupiter, we do not recur to earthquakes and volcanoes for its origin. An atmosphere, with
its natural changes, will explain such belts. Our spot in the sun may be accounted for on the same principles. The earth is surrounded by an atmosphere, composed of various elastic fluids. The sun also has its atmosphere, and if some of the fluids which enter into its composition should be of a shining brilliancy, in the manner that will be explained hereafter, while others are merely transparent, any temporary cause which may remove the lucid fluid will permit us to see the body of the sun through the transparent ones. If an observer were placed on the moon, he would see the solid body of our earth only in those places where the transparent fluids of our atmosphere would permit him. In others, the opaque vapours would reflect the light of the sun, without permitting his view to penetrate to the surface of our globe. He would probably also find that our planet had occasionally some shining fluids in its atmosphere; as, not unlikely, some of our northern lights might not escape his notice, if they happened in the unenlightened part of the earth, and were seen by him in his long dark night. Nay, we have pretty good reason to believe, that probably all the planets emit light in some degree; for the illumination which remains on the moon in a total eclipse cannot be entirely ascribed to the light which may reach it by the refraction of the earth&#x27;s atmosphere. For instance in the eclipse of the moon, which happened October 22, 1790, the rays of the sun refracted by the atmosphere of the earth towards the moon, admitting the mean horizontal refraction to be $30&#x27;50&#x27;&#x27;$,8, would meet in a focus above 189 thousand miles beyond the moon; so that consequently there could be no illumination from rays refracted by our atmosphere. It is, however, not improbable, that about the polar regions of the
earth there may be refraction enough to bring some of the solar rays to a shorter focus. The distance of the moon at the time of the eclipse would require a refraction of $54&#x27; 6&#x27;&#x27;$ equal to its horizontal parallax at that time, to bring them to a focus so as to throw light on the moon.

The unenlightened part of the planet Venus has also been seen by different persons, and not having a satellite, those regions that are turned from the sun cannot possibly shine by a borrowed light; so that this faint illumination must denote some phosphoric quality of the atmosphere of Venus.

In the instance of our large spot on the sun, I concluded from appearances that I viewed the real solid body of the sun itself, of which we rarely see more than its shining atmosphere.

In the year 1783, I observed a fine large spot, and followed it up to the edge of the sun&#x27;s limb. Here I took notice that the spot was plainly depressed below the surface of the sun; and that it had very broad shelving sides. I also suspected some part, at least, of the shelving sides to be elevated above the surface of the sun; and observed that, contrary to what usually happens, the margin of that side of the spot, which was farthest from the limb, was the broadest.

The luminous shelving sides of a spot may be explained by a gentle and gradual removal of the shining fluid, which permits us to see the globe of the sun. As to the uncommon appearance of the broadest margin being on that side of the spot which was farthest from the limb when the spot came near the edge of it, we may surmise that the sun has inequalities on its surface, which may possibly be the cause of it. For, when mountainous countries are exposed, if it should chance that the highest parts of the landscape are situated so as to be near that
side of the margin, or penumbra of the spot, which is towards the limb, it may partly intercept our view of it, when the spot is seen very obliquely. This would require elevations at least five or six hundred miles high; but considering the great attraction exerted by the sun upon bodies at its surface, and the slow revolution it has upon its axis, we may readily admit inequalities to that amount. From the centrifugal force at the sun&#x27;s equator, and the weight of bodies at its surface, I compute that the power of throwing down a mountain by the exertion of the former, balanced by the superior force of keeping it in its situation of the latter, is near six and a half times less on the sun than on our equatorial regions; and as an elevation similar to one of three miles on the earth would not be less than 334 miles on the sun, there can be no doubt but that a mountain much higher would stand very firmly. The little density of the solar body seems also to be in favour of the height of its mountains; for, *ceteris paribus*, dense bodies will sooner come to their level than rare ones. The difference in the vanishing of the shelving side, instead of explaining it by mountains, may also, and perhaps more satisfactorily, be accounted for from the real difference of the extent, the arrangement, the height, and the intensity of the shining fluid, added to the occasional changes that may happen in these particulars, during the time in which the spot approaches to the edge of the disc. However, by admitting large mountains on the surface of the sun, we shall account for the different opinions of two eminent astronomers; one of whom believed the spots depressed below the sun, while the other supposed them elevated above it. For it is not improbable that some of the solar mountains may be high enough occasionally to project above
the shining elastic fluid, when, by some agitation or other cause, it is not of the usual height; and this opinion is much strengthened by the return of some remarkable spots, which served Cassini to ascertain the period of the sun&#x27;s rotation. A very high country, or chain of mountains, may oftener become visible, by the removal of the obstructing fluid, than the lower regions, on account of its not being so deeply covered with it.

In the year 1791, I examined a large spot in the sun, and found it evidently depressed below the level of the surface; about the dark part was a broad margin, or plane of considerable extent, less bright than the sun, and also lower than its surface. This plane seemed to rise, with shelving sides, up to the place where it joined the level of the surface.

In confirmation of these appearances, I carefully remarked that the disc of the sun was visibly convex; and the reason of my attention to this particular, was my being already long acquainted with a certain optical deception, that takes place now and then when we view the moon; which is, that all the elevated spots on its surface will seem to be cavities, and all cavities will assume the shape of mountains. But then, at the same time the moon, instead of having the convex appearance of a globe, will seem to be a large concave portion of an hollow sphere. As soon as, by the force of imagination, you drive away the fallacious appearance of a concave moon, you restore the mountains to their protuberance, and sink the cavities again below the level of the surface. Now, when I saw the spot lower than the shining matter of the sun, and an extended plane, also depressed, with shelving sides rising up to the level, I also found that the sun was convex, and appeared in
its natural globular state. Hence I conclude that there could be no deception in those appearances.

How very ill would this observation agree with the ideas of solid bodies bobbing up and down in a fiery liquid? with the smoke of volcanoes, or scum upon an ocean? And how easily it is explained upon our foregoing theory. The removal of the shining atmosphere, which permits us to see the sun, must naturally be attended with a gradual diminution on its borders; an instance of a similar kind we have daily before us, when through the opening of a cloud we see the sky, which generally is attended by a surrounding haziness of some short extent; and seldom transits, from a perfect clearness, at once to the greatest obscurity.

Aug. 26, 1792. I examined the sun with several powers, from 90 to 500. It appears evidently that the black spots are the opaque ground, or body of the sun; and that the luminous part is an atmosphere, which, being interrupted or broken, gives us a transient glimpse of the sun itself. My 7-feet reflector, which is in high perfection, represents the spots, as it always used to do, much depressed below the surface of the luminous part.

Sept. 2, 1792. I saw two spots in the sun with the naked eye. In the telescope I found they were clusters of spots, with many scattered ones besides. Every one of them was certainly below the surface of the luminous disc.

Sept. 8, 1792. Having made a small speculum, merely brought to a perfect figure upon hones, without polish, I found, that by stifling a great part of the solar rays, my object speculum would bear a greater aperture; and thus enabled me to see with more comfort, and less danger. The surface of
the sun was unequal; many parts of it being elevated, and others depressed. This is here to be understood of the shining surface only, as the real body of the sun can probably be seldom seen, otherwise than in its black spots.

It may not be impossible, as light is a transparent fluid, that the sun&#x27;s real surface also may now and then be perceived; as we see the shape of the wick of a candle through its flame, or the contents of a furnace in the midst of the brightest glare of it; but this, I should suppose, will only happen where the lucid matter of the sun is not very accumulated.

Sept. 9, 1792. I found one of the dark spots in the sun drawn pretty near the preceding edge. In its neighbourhood I saw a great number of elevated bright places, making various figures. I shall call them faculæ, with Hevelius; but without assigning to this term any other meaning than what it will hereafter appear ought to be given to it. I see these faculæ extended, on the preceding side, over about one-sixth part of the sun; but so far from resembling torches, they appear to me like the shrivelled elevations upon a dried apple, extended in length, and most of them are joined together, making waves, or waving lines.

By some good views in the afternoon, I find that the rest of the surface of the sun does not contain any faculæ, except a few on the following, and equatorial part of the sun. Towards the north and south I see no faculæ; there is all over the sun a great unevenness in the surface, which has the appearance of a mixture of small points of an unequal light; but they are evidently an unevenness or roughness of high and low parts.

Sept. 11, 1792. The faculæ, in the preceding part of the
sun, are much gone out of the disc, and those in the following are come on. A dark spot also is come on with them.

Sept. 13, 1792. There are a great number of faculae on the equatorial part of the sun, towards the preceding and following parts. I cannot see any towards the poles; but a roughness is visible everywhere.

Sept. 16, 1792. The sun contains many large faculae, on the following side of its equator, and also several on the preceding side. I perceive none about the poles. They seem generally to accompany the spots, and probably, as the faculae certainly are elevations, a great number of them may occasion neighbouring depressions: that is to say, dark spots.

The faculae being elevations, very satisfactorily explains the reason why they disappear towards the middle of the sun, and re-appear on the other margin; for, about the place where we lose them, they begin to be edge-ways to our view; and if between the faculae should lie dark spots, they will most frequently break out in the middle of the sun, because they are no longer covered by the side views of these faculae.

Sept. 22, 1792. There are not many faculae in the sun, and but few spots; the whole disc, however, is very much marked with roughness, like an orange. Some of the lowest parts of the inequalities are blackish.

Sept. 23, 1792. The following side of the sun contains many faculae, near the limb. They take up an arch of about 50 degrees. There are, likewise, some on the preceding side. The north and south is rough as usual; but differently disposed. The faculae are ridges of elevations above the rough surface.

Feb. 23, 1794. By an experiment I have just now tried, I find it confirmed that the sun cannot be so distinctly viewed
with a small aperture and faint darkening glasses, as with a large aperture and stronger ones; this latter is the method I always use.

One of the black spots on the preceding margin, which was greatly below the surface of the sun, had, next to it, a protuberant lump of shining matter, a little brighter than the rest of the sun.

About all the spots, the shining matter seems to have been disturbed; and is uneven, lumpy, and zig-zagged in an irregular manner.

I call the spots black, not that they are entirely so, but merely to distinguish them; for there is not one of them, to-day, which is not partly, or entirely, covered over with whitish and unequally bright nebulosity, or cloudiness. This, in many of them, comes near to an extinction of the spot; and in others, seems to bring on a subdivision.

Sept. 28, 1794. There is a dark spot in the sun on the following side. It is certainly depressed below the shining atmosphere, and has shelving sides of shining matter, which rise up higher than the general surface, and are brightest at the top. The preceding shelving side is rendered almost invisible, by the overhanging of the preceding elevations; while the following is very well exposed: the spot being apparently such in figure as denotes a circular form, viewed in an oblique direction.

Near the following margin are many bright elevations, close to visible depressions. The depressed parts are less bright than the common surface.

The penumbra, as it is called, about this spot, is a consi-
derable plane, of less brightness than the common surface, and seems to be as much depressed below that surface as the spot is below the plane.

Hence, if the brightness of the sun is occasioned by the lucid atmosphere, the intensity of the brightness must be less where it is depressed; for light, being transparent, must be the more intense the more it is deep.

Oct. 12, 1794. The whole surface of the sun is diversified by inequality in the elevation of the shining atmosphere. The lowest parts are everywhere darkest; and every little pit has the appearance of a more or less dark spot.

A dark spot, which is on the preceding side, is surrounded by very great inequalities in the elevation of the lucid atmosphere; and its depression below the same is bounded by an immediate rising of very bright light.

Oct. 13, 1794. The spot in the sun I observed yesterday is drawn so near the margin, that the elevated side of the following part of it hides all the black ground, and still leaves the cavity visible, so that the depression of the black spots, and the elevation of the faculæ, are equally evident.

It will now be easy to bring the result of these observations into a very narrow compass. That the sun has a very extensive atmosphere cannot be doubted; and that this atmosphere consists of various elastic fluids, that are more or less lucid and transparent, and of which the lucid one is that which furnishes us with light, seems also to be fully established by all the phænomena of its spots, of the faculæ, and of the lucid surface itself. There is no kind of variety in these appearances
but what may be accounted for with the greatest facility, from the continual agitation which we may easily conceive must take place in the regions of such extensive elastic fluids.

It will be necessary, however, to be a little more particular, as to the manner in which I suppose the lucid fluid of the sun to be generated in its atmosphere. An analogy that may be drawn from the generation of clouds in our own atmosphere, seems to be a very proper one, and full of instruction. Our clouds are probably decompositions of some of the elastic fluids of the atmosphere itself, when such natural causes, as in this grand chemical laboratory are generally at work, act upon them; we may therefore admit that in the very extensive atmosphere of the sun, from causes of the same nature, similar phænomena will take place; but with this difference, that the continual and very extensive decompositions of the elastic fluids of the sun, are of a phosphoric nature, and attended with lucid appearances, by giving out light.

If it should be objected, that such violent and unremitting decompositions would exhaust the sun, we may recur again to our analogy, which will furnish us with the following reflections. The extent of our own atmosphere, we see, is still preserved, notwithstanding the copious decompositions of its fluids, in clouds and falling rain; in flashes of lightning, in meteors, and other luminous phænomena; because there are fresh supplies of elastic vapours, continually ascending to make good the waste occasioned by those decompositions. But it may be urged, that the case with the decomposition of the elastic fluids in the solar atmosphere would be very different, since light is emitted, and does not return to the sun, as clouds do to the earth when they descend in showers of rain. To
which I answer, that in the decomposition of phosphoric fluids every other ingredient but light may also return to the body of the sun. And that the emission of light must waste the sun, is not a difficulty that can be opposed to our hypothesis. For as it is an evident fact that the sun does emit light, the same objection, if it could be one, would equally militate against every other assignable way to account for the phenomenon.

There are moreover considerations that may lessen the pressure of this alleged difficulty. We know the exceeding subtilty of light to be such, that in ages of time its emanation from the sun cannot very sensibly lessen the size of this great body. To this may be added, that, very possibly, there may also be ways of restoration to compensate for what is lost by the emission of light; though the manner in which this can be brought about should not appear to us. Many of the operations of nature are carried on in her great laboratory, which we cannot comprehend; but now and then we see some of the tools with which she is at work. We need not wonder that their construction should be so singular as to induce us to confess our ignorance of the method of employing them, but we may rest assured that they are not a mere lusus naturæ. I allude to the great number of small telescopic comets that have been observed; and to the far greater number still that are probably much too small for being noticed by our most diligent searchers after them. Those six, for instance, which my sister has discovered, I can from examination affirm had not the least appearance of any solid nucleus, and seemed to be mere collections of vapours condensed about a centre. Five more, that I have also observed, were nearly of the same nature.
This throws a mystery over their destination, which seems to place them in the allegorical view of tools, probably designed for some salutary purposes to be wrought by them; and, whether the restoration of what is lost to the sun by the emission of light, the possibility of which we have been mentioning above, may not be one of these purposes, I shall not presume to determine. The motion of the comet discovered by Mr. Messier in June, 1770, plainly indicated how much its orbit was liable to be changed, by the perturbations of the planets; from which, and the little agreement that can be found between the elements of the orbits of all the comets that have been observed, it appears clearly that they may be directed to carry their salutary influence to any part of the heavens.

My hypothesis, however, as before observed, does not lay me under any obligation to explain how the sun can sustain the waste of light, nor to shew that it will sustain it for ever; and I should also remark that, as in the analogy of generating clouds I merely allude to their production as owing to a decomposition of some of the elastic fluids of our atmosphere, that analogy, which firmly rests upon the fact, will not be less to my purpose to whatever cause these clouds may owe their origin. It is the same with the lucid clouds, if I may so call them, of the sun. They plainly exist, because we see them; the manner of their being generated may remain an hypothesis; and mine, till a better can be proposed, may stand good; but whether it does or not, the consequences I am going to draw from what has been said will not be affected by it.

Before I proceed, I shall only point out, that according to the above theory, a dark spot in the sun is a place in its atmosphere which happens to be free from luminous decomposi-
tions; and that faculae are, on the contrary, more copious mixtures of such fluids as decompose each other. The penumbra which attends the spots, being generally depressed more or less to about half way between the solid body of the sun and the upper part of those regions in which luminous decompositions take place, must of course be fainter than other parts. No spot favourable for taking measures having lately been on the sun, I can only judge, from former appearances, that the regions in which the luminous solar clouds are formed, adding thereto the elevation of the faculae, cannot be less than 1843, nor much more than 2765 miles in depth. It is true that in our atmosphere the extent of the clouds is limited to a very narrow compass; but we ought rather to compare the solar ones to the luminous decompositions which take place in our aurora borealis, or luminous arches, which extend much farther than the cloudy regions. The density of the luminous solar clouds, though very great, may not be exceedingly more so than that of our aurora borealis. For, if we consider what would be the brilliancy of a space two or three thousand miles deep, filled with such corruscations as we see now and then in our atmosphere, their apparent intensity, when viewed at the distance of the sun, might not be much inferior to that of the lucid solar fluid.

From the luminous atmosphere of the sun I proceed to its opaque body, which by calculation from the power it exerts upon the planets we know to be of great solidity; and from the phenomena of the dark spots, many of which, probably on account of their high situations, have been repeatedly seen, and otherwise denote inequalities in their level, we surmise that its surface is diversified with mountains and vallies.
What has been said enables us to come to some very important conclusions, by remarking, that this way of considering the sun and its atmosphere, removes the great dissimilarity we have hitherto been used to find between its condition and that of the rest of the great bodies of the solar system.

The sun, viewed in this light, appears to be nothing else than a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, evidently the first, or in strictness of speaking, the only primary one of our system; all others being truly secondary to it. Its similarity to the other globes of the solar system with regard to its solidity, its atmosphere, and its diversified surface; the rotation upon its axis, and the fall of heavy bodies, leads us on to suppose that it is most probably also inhabited, like the rest of the planets, by beings whose organs are adapted to the peculiar circumstances of that vast globe.

Whatever fanciful poets might say, in making the sun the abode of blessed spirits, or angry moralists devise, in pointing it out as a fit place for the punishment of the wicked; it does not appear that they had any other foundation for their assertions than mere opinion and vague surmise; but now I think myself authorized, upon astronomical principles, to propose the sun as an inhabitable world, and am persuaded that the foregoing observations, with the conclusions I have drawn from them, are fully sufficient to answer every objection that may be made against it.

It may, however, not be amiss to remove a certain difficulty, which arises from the effect of the sun&#x27;s rays upon our globe. The heat which is here, at the distance of 95 millions of miles, produced by these rays, is so considerable, that it may be objected, that the surface of the globe of the sun itself must be scorched up beyond all conception.
This may be very substantially answered by many proofs drawn from natural philosophy, which shew that heat is produced by the sun&#x27;s rays only when they act upon a calorific medium; they are the cause of the production of heat, by uniting with the matter of fire, which is contained in the substances that are heated: as the collision of flint and steel will inflame a magazine of gunpowder, by putting all the latent fire it contains into action. But an instance or two of the manner in which the solar rays produce their effect, will bring this home to our most common experience.

On the tops of mountains of a sufficient height, at an altitude where clouds can very seldom reach, to shelter them from the direct rays of the sun, we always find regions of ice and snow. Now if the solar rays themselves conveyed all the heat we find on this globe, it ought to be hottest where their course is least interrupted. Again, our aéronauts all confirm the coldness of the upper regions of the atmosphere; and since, therefore, even on our earth the heat of any situation depends upon the aptness of the medium to yield to the impression of the solar rays, we have only to admit, that on the sun itself, the elastic fluids composing its atmosphere, and the matter on its surface, are of such a nature as not to be capable of any excessive affection from its own rays; and, indeed, this seems to be proved by the copious emission of them; for if the elastic fluids of the atmosphere, or the matter contained on the surface of the sun, were of such a nature as to admit of an easy, chemical combination with its rays, their emission would be much impeded.

Another well known fact is, that the solar focus of the largest lens, thrown into the air, will occasion no sensible heat in the place where it has been kept for a considerable
time, although its power of exciting combustion, when proper bodies are exposed, should be sufficient to fuse the most refractory substances.*

It will not be necessary to mention other objections, as I can think of none that may be made, but what a proper consideration of the foregoing observations will easily remove; such as may be urged from the dissimilarity between the luminous atmosphere of the sun and that of our globe will be touched upon hereafter, when I consider the objections that may be assigned against the moon&#x27;s being an inhabitable satellite.

I shall now endeavour, by analogical reasonings, to support the ideas I have suggested concerning the construction and purposes of the sun; in order to which, it will be necessary to begin with such arguments as the nature of the case will admit, to shew that our moon is probably inhabited. This satellite is of all the heavenly bodies the nearest, and therefore most within the reach of our telescopes. Accordingly we find, by repeated inspection, that we can with perfect confidence give the following account of it.

It is a secondary planet, of a considerable size; the surface of which is diversified, like that of the earth, by mountains and vallies. Its situation, with respect to the sun, is much like that of the earth; and, by a rotation on its axis, it enjoys an agreeable variety of seasons, and of day and night. To the moon, our globe will appear to be a very capital satellite;

* The subject of light and heat has been very ably discussed by Mr. de Luc, in his excellent work, Idées sur la Météorologie, Tome I. part 2, chap. 2, section 2, De la Nature du Feu; and Tome II. part 3, chap. 6, section 2, Des Rapports de la Lumière avec la Chaleur dans l&#x27;Atmosphère.

undergoing the same regular changes of illuminations as the moon does to the earth. The sun, the planets, and the starry constellations of the heavens, will rise and set there as they do here; and heavy bodies will fall on the moon as they do on the earth. There seems only to be wanting, in order to complete the analogy, that it should be inhabited like the earth.

To this it may be objected, that we perceive no large seas in the moon; that its atmosphere (the existence of which has even been doubted by many) is extremely rare, and unfit for the purposes of animal life; that its climates, its seasons, and the length of its days, totally differ from ours; that without dense clouds (which the moon has not), there can be no rain; perhaps no rivers, no lakes. In short, that, notwithstanding the similarity which has been pointed out, there seems to be a decided difference in the two planets we have compared.

My answer to this will be, that that very difference which is now objected, will rather strengthen the force of my argument than lessen its value: we find, even upon our globe, that there is the most striking difference in the situation of the creatures that live upon it. While man walks upon the ground, the birds fly in the air, and fishes swim in water; we can certainly not object to the conveniences afforded by the moon, if those that are to inhabit its regions are fitted to their conditions as well as we on this globe are to ours. An absolute, or total sameness, seems rather to denote imperfections, such as nature never exposes to our view; and, on this account, I believe the analogies that have been mentioned fully sufficient to establish the high probability of the moon&#x27;s being inhabited like the earth.

To proceed, we will now suppose an inhabitant of the moon,
who has not properly considered such analogical reasonings as might induce him to surmise that our earth is inhabited, were to give it as his opinion that the use of that great body, which he sees in his neighbourhood, is to carry about his little globe, that it may be properly exposed to the light of the sun, so as to enjoy an agreeable and useful variety of illumination, as well as to give it light by reflection from the sun, when direct daylight cannot be had. Suppose also that the inhabitants of the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgian planet, were to look upon the primary ones, to which they belong, as mere attractive centres, to keep together their orbits, to direct their revolution round the sun, and to supply them with reflected light in the absence of direct illumination. Ought we not to condemn their ignorance, as proceeding from want of attention and proper reflection? It is very true that the earth, and those other planets that have satellites about them, perform all the offices that have been named, for the inhabitants of these little globes; but to us, who live upon one of these planets, their reasonings cannot but appear very defective; when we see what a magnificent dwelling place the earth affords to numberless intelligent beings.

These considerations ought to make the inhabitants of the planets wiser than we have supposed those of their satellites to be. We surely ought not, like them, to say &quot;the sun (that immense globe, whose body would much more than fill the whole orbit of the moon) is merely an attractive centre to us.&quot; From experience we can affirm, that the performance of the most salutary offices to inferior planets, is not inconsistent with the dignity of superior purposes; and, in consequence of such analogical reasonings, assisted by telescopic
views, which plainly favour the same opinion, we need not hesitate to admit that the sun is richly stored with inhabitants.

This way of considering the sun is of the utmost importance in its consequences. That stars are suns can hardly admit of a doubt. Their immense distance would perfectly exclude them from our view, if the light they send us were not of the solar kind. Besides, the analogy may be traced much farther. The sun turns on its axis. So does the star Algol. So do the stars called $\beta$ Lyrae, $\delta$ Cephei, $\eta$ Antinoi, $\sigma$ Ceti, and many more; most probably all. From what other cause can we so probably account for their periodical changes? Again, our sun has spots on its surface. So has the star Algol; and so have the stars already named; and probably every star in the heavens. On our sun these spots are changeable. So they are on the star $\sigma$ Ceti; as evidently appears from the irregularity of its changeable lustre, which is often broken in upon by accidental changes, while the general period continues unaltered. The same little deviations have been observed in other periodical stars, and ought to be ascribed to the same cause. But if stars are suns, and suns are inhabitable, we see at once what an extensive field for animation opens itself to our view.

It is true that analogy may induce us to conclude, that since stars appear to be suns, and suns, according to the common opinion, are bodies that serve to enlighten, warm, and sustain a system of planets, we may have an idea of numberless globes that serve for the habitation of living creatures. But if these suns themselves are primary planets, we may see some thousands of them with our own eyes; and millions by the help of telescopes; when at the same time, the same analogical
reasoning still remains in full force, with regard to the planets which these suns may support.

In this place I may, however, take notice that, from other considerations, the idea of suns or stars being merely the supporters of systems of planets, is not absolutely to be admitted as a general one. Among the great number of very compressed clusters of stars, I have given in my catalogues, there are some which open a different view of the heavens to us. The stars in them are so very close together, that, notwithstanding the great distance at which we may suppose the cluster itself to be, it will hardly be possible to assign any sufficient mutual distance to the stars composing the cluster, to leave room for crowding in those planets, for whose support these stars have been, or might be, supposed to exist. It should seem, therefore, highly probable that they exist for themselves; and are, in fact, only very capital, lucid, primary planets, connected together in one great system of mutual support.

As in this argument I do not proceed upon conjectures, but have actual observations in view, I shall mention an instance in the clusters, No. 26, 28, and 35, VI. class, of my catalogue of nebulæ, and clusters of stars. (See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXIX. Part II. p. 251.) The stars in them are so crowded, that I cannot conjecture them to be at a greater apparent distance from each other than five seconds; even after a proper allowance for such stars, as on a supposition of a globular form of the cluster, will interfere with one another, has been made. Now, if we would leave as much room between each of these stars as there is between the sun and Sirius, we must place these clusters $4 \times 10^4$ times as far from us as that star is from the sun. But in order to bring down the lustre of Sirius to
that of an equal star placed at such a distance, I ought to reduce the aperture of my 20-feet telescope to less than the two-and-twenty hundredth part of an inch; when certainly I could no longer expect to see any star at all.

The same remark may be made, with regard to the number of very close double stars; whose apparent diameters being alike, and not very small, do not indicate any very great mutual distance. From which, however, must be deducted all those where the different distances may be compensated by the real difference in their respective magnitudes.

To what has been said may be added, that in some parts of the milky way, where yet the stars are not very small, they are so crowded, that in the year 1792, Aug. 22, I found by the gages that, in 41 minutes of time, no less than 258 thousand of them had passed through the field of view of my telescope.*

It seems, therefore, upon the whole not improbable that, in

* The star-gages ran thus:

From $19^h\ 35&#x27;$ to $19^h\ 51&#x27;$ 600 stars in the field

$19\ 51&#x27; - 19\ 57&#x27;\ 440$

$19\ 57&#x27; - 20\ 12&#x27;\ 360$

$20\ 12&#x27; - 20\ 16&#x27;\ 260$

The breadth of the sweep was $2^o\ 35&#x27;$, the diameter of the field $15&#x27;$, and the mean polar distance $73^o\ 54&#x27;$. Then let

$F$, be the diameter of the field of view,

$S$, the number of stars in each field,

$B$, the breadth of the sweep, plus $F$,

$T$, the length of the sweep expressed in minutes of space,

$\phi$, the sine of the mean polar distance,

$C$, the constant-fraction .7854,

and the stars in these four successive short sweeps will be found by the expression

$\frac{B\ T\ S\ \phi}{F^2\ C}$ equal to $133095.\ 36601.\ 74866.\ 14419.$ or in all $258981.$
many cases, stars are united in such close systems as not to leave much room for the orbits of planets, or comets; and that consequently, upon this account also, many stars, unless we would make them mere useless brilliant points, may themselves be lucid planets, perhaps unattended by satellites.

POSTSCRIPT.

The following observations, which were made with an improved apparatus, and under the most favourable circumstances, should be added to those which have been given. They are decisive with regard to one of the conditions of the lucid matter of the sun.

Nov. 26, 1794. Eight spots in the sun, and several subdivisions of them, are all equally depressed.

The sun is mottled every where.

The mottled appearance of the sun is owing to an inequality in the level of the surface.

The sun is equally mottled at its poles and at its equator; but the mottled appearances may be seen better about the middle of the disc than towards the circumference, on account of the sun&#x27;s spherical form.

The unevenness arising from the elevation and depression of the mottled appearance on the surface of the sun, seems, in many places, to amount to as much, or to nearly as much as the depression of the penumbræ of the spots below the upper part of the shining substance; without including faculæ, which are protuberant.

The lucid substance of the sun is neither a liquid, nor an
elastic fluid; as is evident from its not instantly filling up the cavities of the spots, and of the unevenness of the mottled parts. It exists, therefore, in the manner of lucid clouds swimming in the transparent atmosphere of the sun; or rather, of luminous decompositions taking place within that atmosphere.</div>
