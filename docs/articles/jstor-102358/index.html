But the Brain being confined in so narrow an enclosure, it stints its growth and enlargement; yet may be sufficient to supply Spirits for the maintaining those Offices of Life the Fetus enjoys, before the Birth whilst in the Womb.

But somewhat to confirm these Instances given in the same Transaction, of Life continuing after the loss of a great part of the Brain, I shall add this following Observation.

IV. An Observation of one Hemisphere of the Brain sphacelated, and of a Stone found in the substance of the Brain itself: By Edward Tyson, Fellow of the College of Physicians and R. S.

Decemb. 12, 1688. I was desired to be present at the opening of Mr. A. About Two Months before (as I was informed) he had received in a Quarrel at the Tavern a great bruise on his Head by a Quart Pot. But for the present neglected the use of means, till at last he was forced to betake himself to his Bed. Dr. Morton was sent for. He found him to complain of a most violent pain in his Head. He sometimes Vo-
mited; sometimes was in Convulsions; sometimes in
the day he would have a great Stupor upon him; and
when he waked would be delirious. His swallowing
was difficult, and he would grin his Teeth: his Eye-sight
afterwards failed him, and he lost his Memory; and
upon the least Motion of his Body would faint away,
and in the whole Course of his Distemper was ter-
verish.

Upon opening his Head I observed the Blood Ves-
sels of the Meninges very much extended; but what
surprized me more was, to find the greatest part of
the left Hemisphere or side of the Cerebrum or Brain
to be perfectly rotten or Sphacelated, not having the
least consistency but purulent and soft: Nor could I
distinguish the Medullary substance from the Cinerice-
ous; but all of a dark reddish colour: So that I no
ways wonder&#x27;d at the Symptoms he complained of,
but rather that he lived so long; there being so consi-
derable a part of the Substance of the Brain itself wholly
corrupted.

In the Ventricles of the Brain I observed a great
deal of Water: But the greatest surprize of all was
the Protuberantia Orbicularis call&#x27;d the Testis on the
left side; which was as big as a Nutmeg: For upon
dissecting I found in a purulent Matter there a Chalky
Stone, about the bigness of a Cherry-stone, but flat
and not very thick; and in taking it out I found it
friable, and have part of the Stone now by me.

There are frequent Observations of Stones found in
the Glandula Pinealis; and I have seen the Glands of
the Tunica Choroides petrified: But Stones to be found
in the Substance of the Brain itself, I think is very
rare. &#x27;Tis true Jacobus Hollerius mentions Stones to be
found in the Brain; but is nowhere particular in de-
claring where, as neither is Kentmannus, in telling us
where that was found he gives a Figure of it like a Mulberry: and as Gul. Fab. Hildanus well observes. In hujusmodi enim Historiis &amp; quidem tanti momenti, omnia ad unguem adumbrentur, necesse est; aliòquin Cerebrum, cum pars Corporis sit nobilissima, vixque aliquid praeter naturale uti indies diligens Practicus observare poteat sufferre posse; Non immerito aliquis Historias praescriptas D. D. Kentmanni &amp; D.D. Hollerii in dubium Vocare posse. &amp;c.

V. Part of a Letter from Mr. Octavian Pulleyn, dated, Rome March 16 1696, giving an account of an Inscription there found in the Language of the Palmereni; and another in the Etruscan Language found on an old Vase.

Dr. Halifax calling here in his return home from Aleppo, I had the honour of his acquaintance. Among other things, he told me he was to search for an Inscription in the Language of the Palmereni mentioned by Dr. Spon in his Miscellanea Fol. p. 3. and desired my Assistance, which I readily offer&#x27;d him; but Dr. Spon saying only that it was in Rome, we were to seek, and the Weather being very bad (it being Winter) our enquiry was fruitless. At his departure he enjoy&#x27;d me to find it out if I could. Hearing Sig. Fabretti Canon of St. Peter&#x27;s was publishing a Book of Old Inscriptions, I waited upon him, and by him was fully inform&#x27;d to my purpose. He lent me also a Draught of it, and said no Person else had had it to Copy but one Grodeick of Dantzig. I was well pleas&#x27;d with the information, and Paper I had got, but not satisfied till I had compared it with the Original. I went as I was directed</div>
