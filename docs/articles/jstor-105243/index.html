<div class="ocr-text">XVIII. An Account of the State of the Thermometer at the Hague on the 9th of January 1757. Extracted from a Letter of Mr. Abraham Trembley, F.R.S. to Tho. Birch, D.D. Secret. R.S.

Hague, Febr. 15. 1757.

Read Mar. 3, 1757. I Carefully observed the thermometer during the cold days, which we have had this winter. I made use of the same thermometer, with which I made my observations in 1740, and for that purpose fixed it in the same place, where it was that year, viz. in a window directly exposed to the north, and open to a large square. In 1740 I saw Fahrenheit&#x27;s thermometer at two degrees below 0. This year, on the 9th day of January in the morning, it was at three degrees above 0; that is, only five degrees higher than in 1740.

By William Lewis, M.B. F.R.S.
