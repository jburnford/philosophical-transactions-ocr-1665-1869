XIII. A Letter from John Martyn, M.D. Prof. Botan. Cantab. &amp; F.R.S. to the President, concerning an Aurora Borealis seen February 16. 1749-50.

SIR,

Chelsey, Feb. 21. 1749-50.

Read Feb. 22.

ON Friday the 16th there was a bright Aurora Borealis, the Northern Part of the Sky being entirely filled with a pale Light, in which frequent Coruscations were visible. Besides these Lights, there was a perfect uniform Arch, extending from East to West: the Colour of it was the same with that of the Aurora; with which however it did not seem to have any Communication, being placed several Degrees to the Southward. The Shoulders of Orion were visible thro&#x27; this luminous Arch, in the Western Part of it, and Cor Leonis in the Eastern Part. I did not happen to see it till about a Quarter before Ten; and at Ten it disappeared. The Weather was then, and has been ever since, exceedingly warm for the Season. The Walls are covered with Blossoms; and the Hyacinths, Daffodils, &amp;c. are blown before the usual time. I am, with the greatest Respect,

SIR,

Your most humble Servant,
JOHN MARTYN.</div>
