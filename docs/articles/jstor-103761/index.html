<div class="ocr-text">VI. A Letter from Mr. John Bonnet, Surgeon at Fowye in Cornwall, to Claudius Amyand, Esq; Serjeant-Surgeon to his Majesty, F. R. S. concerning the preternatural Structure of the Pudenda in a Woman, describ&#x27;d in Phil. Transact. No 379.

As there appears to be some Difference in the Accounts of the remarkable Structure of the Pudenda, &amp;c. of the Woman of Lanteglass, near Fowye, publish&#x27;d in the Philosophical Transactions No 379. I take the Liberty of giving you a particular Account of what I observ&#x27;d, with respect to this Matter. This I am the rather embolden&#x27;d to do, as I repeatedly observ&#x27;d the wonderful Structure of the Parts, before the Birth approach&#x27;d, and before I was oblig&#x27;d to make the Incision.

This Woman was about 23 Years old when she was married, and some time after conceiv&#x27;d. As she was conscious of the preternatural Structure of the Parts, and her Mother apprehensive of the Danger that wou&#x27;d attend the Delivery under such unhappy Circumstances; they apply&#x27;d to me about the 7th Month, in order to engage my Assistance.

On viewing the Abdomen, I made the following Observations; There was no Sign of the Umbilicus; but about three Inches lower, than that is regularly plac&#x27;d in Persons naturally form&#x27;d, there was a spongy, fleshy Exuberance, nearly of the Shape and Bignets of an Hen-Egg: Not, as is said in Mr. O ... &#x27;s Account, compos&#x27;d of many Lobules involv&#x27;d by distinct Membranes, but
but entirely resembling that luxuriant Flesh which is thrown forth in ill-digested Wounds, and is therefore commonly call&#x27;d proud Flesh. This was exceeding tender, and on it she cou&#x27;d not bear the least Touch. On the lower Part of this Excrecence, I perceiv&#x27;d two small Orifices, the one distant from the other about an Inch. Thro&#x27; these the Urine drops continually, nor is she able to retain it; but by violent Efforts can make it spout out near a Foot. What is laid in Mr. O....&#x27;s Account of its being render&#x27;d multis rivulis, is certainly erroneous: The two Orifices, by which it is indeed discharg&#x27;d, being now very evident, and will easily admit a small Probe.

About $\frac{1}{4}$ Inch below this Protuberance, was a transverse Orifice, much resembling the Anus of a Cock. Through this the Menstrua regularly flow&#x27;d: By this she was impregnated. &#x27;Twas with some Difficulty I thrust my Finger into this Orifice, in order to reach the Os Tince, which, however, I could by no means feel, it lay so deep; but I plainly felt a thick transverse Membrane separating this Passage from an Orifice, which is situated about two Inches below that already describ&#x27;d. This lower Orifice seem&#x27;d to be situated, exactly where the Symphysis of the Offa Pubis is, in Women regularly form&#x27;d, somewhat above the Place where the natural Hiatus shou&#x27;d have been. I cou&#x27;d but just enter the Tip of my Finger into this. There were a few Hairs scatter&#x27;d up and down irregularly about this Orifice. The Anus terminated as usual, with a Sphincter, about two Inches below this lower Orifice, much more forward than usual.

So that the upper Orifice, which may be properly call&#x27;d the Orifice of the Vagina, was about $\frac{1}{4}$ Inch below the umbilical Excrecence: The lower oblong Orifice (or another Passage to the Womb) was about two Inches.
Inches below that of the *Vagina*: Contrary to what is said in Mr. O....&#x27;s Account, who makes the superior Orifice to be near four Inches below the Excrecence, and the lower Orifice four Inches from the superior; and then says, the *Anus*, which he (rightly enough) makes to usurp the Place of the *Fossa magna* in Women naturally conformed, was five or six Inches below this. According to this Proportion, the Woman must be really gigantick; whereas she is a short, little Woman: But however, Worthy Sir, you may depend upon the Account and Measure I have given; nor do Mr. O....&#x27;s Cuts any way represent the Case.

This Woman had no *Os*, or *Os Pubis*; indeed there was an *Apophysis* jutting out from the lower Part of each *Os Ilium*, but they were far from being join&#x27;d, as usual, by *Synchondrosis*.

*July 18. 1722.* I was sent for late at Night. I found the Woman with true Travail-Pains upon her. The Throws were excessive violent, and the continued Agony had almost quite exhausted the poor Woman&#x27;s Spirits; but the Orifice of the *Vagina* was no way sensibly dilated, tho&#x27; the *Anus*, thro&#x27; the Violence of the Throws, open&#x27;d extremely wide. In vain were all Endeavours to relieve her, by thrusting up the Child, and putting the Mother in a proper Posture. Vain were her own Throws and Agonies. Convulsions now had seiz&#x27;d her, and Nature seem&#x27;d to have deny&#x27;d a longer Life to the Mother, or an Entrance into it to the Child.

I was in the utmost Perplexity what to do under these Circumstances. On the one Hand I consider&#x27;d, that if there was not a Passage made for the Child, and that by Incision, both Mother and Child must speedily perish. On the other Hand I foresaw the Danger and Hazard of an Incision, and the unavoidable Censure of having kill&#x27;d the Woman, if she should die under the Operation.
Operation. At last Humanity so far prevail&#x27;d with me, as to try a doubtful Method of preserving Life, rather than none.

I told her Mother, and the other Persons in the Room, that Death was inevitable, without making the Passages wider by Incision, and so attempting a Delivery; withal apprising them of the Uncertainty of the Event of the Operation. When they saw her (as they thought) just expiring, they deliver&#x27;d her into my Hands, to do with her what I thought fit.

I immediately thrust my Scalpel into the inferior oblong Orifice, and directly cut into the Orifice of the Vagina; so brought them into one: Then presently with my Scissors, snipp&#x27;d the transverse Membrane. This being done, I easily introduced my Hand, felt the Head of the Child, and with my Finger thrust into its Mouth, drew forth a Female Infant, living and well form&#x27;d, to my own Surprize and Admiration of all. Thus was this Gordian Knot, at last, happily cut, that cou&#x27;d not be unty&#x27;d.

Ever since she was deliver&#x27;d, in the Manner recited, she hath suffer&#x27;d a Prolapsus uteri, upon the least standing or walking. I propos&#x27;d to remedy this by a Suture, as is practis&#x27;d in the Case of the Vulva breaking into the Anus; but she wou&#x27;d by no means admit of it: So that she almost continually labours under a Procidentia uteri, and the Body of the Womb and Vagina are so corroded by the Acrimony of the Urine, that there are four or five Ulcers form&#x27;d upon them. Besides this Inconvenience, some of the thinner Parts of the Excrement are discharg&#x27;d at the Bottom of this large Cleft, and by introducing my Finger at the Bottom of the Cleft, I can easily thrust the Top of it thro&#x27; the Anus: which is an Argument that there cou&#x27;d not be 5 or 6 Inches between the oblong Orifice and the Anus, as is affert-
ed by Mr. O...., the Distance being scarce above two Inches.

Fowey, June 23.
