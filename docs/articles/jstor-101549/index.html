An Account
Of some Observations, lately made in Spain, by His Excellency the Earl of Sandwich.

The Right Honourable the Earl of Sandwich, as he appears eminent in discharging the Trust, his Majesty hath reposed in him, of Ambassador Extraordinary to the King of Spain; so he forgets not in the midst of that Employment, that he is a Member of the Royal Society; but does from time to time, when his weighty State-Negotiations do permit, employ himself in making considerable Observations of divers kinds, both Astronomical and Physiological; and communicateth the same to the said Society; as for instance, lately, what he has observ&#x27;d concerning the Solar Eclipse in June last, the Sun&#x27;s height in the Solstice, and also the Latitude of Madrid, esteeming by the Sun&#x27;s Altitude in the Solstice, and by other Meridian Altitudes, the Latitude of Madrid to be 40 deg. 10 min; which differs considerably from that assigned by others; the General Chart of Europe giving to it 41 deg. 30 min, the General Map of Spain, 40 deg. 27 min. A large Provincial Map of Castile, 40 deg. 38 min.

To these particulars, and others formerly imparted, his Excellency is making more of the same nature; and particularly those of the Immersion of the Satellites of Jupiter.

We must not omit mentioning here, what he hath observed of Halo&#x27;s about the Moon; which he relates in these words;

Decemb. 25. Old Style, 1666. In the Evening, here (vid. at Madrid) was a great Halo about the Moon, the Semidiameter whereof was about 23 deg. 30 min. Aldebaran was just in the North-east part of the Circle, and the two Horns of Aries just enclosed by the South-west of the Circle, the Moon being in the Center. I note this the rather (faith he) because five or six years ago, vid. Novemb. 21. Old Style, 1665, an hour after Sun-set, I saw a great Halo about the Moon of the same Semidiameter,
at Tangier, the Moon being very near the same place, where she was now.

Extract

Of a Letter, lately written by Mr. Nathaniel Fairfax to the Publisher, containing Observations about some Insects, and their Innoxiousness, &amp;c.

The Ingenious Author of this Letter, as he expresses an extraordinary desire to see the store-house of Natural Philosophy, more richly fraughted (a Work begun by the single care and conduct of the Excellent Lord Verulam, and prosecuted by the Joyn-undertakings of the R. Society) so he very frankly offers his Service in contributing some of his Observations, and begins in this very Letter to perform his Offer. For, Having taken notice of what was publish&#x27;d in Numb. 9. p. 161. out of the Italian Philosopher Redi, vid. That Creatures, reputed Venomous, are indeed no Poisons, when swallow&#x27;d, though they may prove so, when put into Wounds: He, for confirmation thereof, alledges Examples of several Persons well known to him (himself also having been an Eye-witness to some such Experiments) who have frequently swallow&#x27;d Spiders, even of the rankest kind, without any more harm than happens to Hens, Robin-red-breasts, and other Birds, who make Spiders their daily Commons. And having made mention of some men, that eat even Toads, he adds, that though a Toad be not a Poison to us in the whole; yet it may invenome outwardly, according to some parts so and so stirr&#x27;d; an instance whereof he alledges in a Boy, who stumbling on a Toad, and hurling stones at it, some Juice from the bruised Toad chanced to light upon his Lips, whereupon they swell&#x27;d, each to the thickness of about two Thumbs: And he neglecting to use, what might be proper to restore them, they have continued in that misshapen size ever since; the ugliness whereof, when the Relator saw, gave him occasion to inquire after the cause of it, which thereupon he understood to be, as has been recited.

On this occasion, the same Gentleman relates, that once seeing a Spider bruised into a small Glass of Water, and that it tinged it</div>
