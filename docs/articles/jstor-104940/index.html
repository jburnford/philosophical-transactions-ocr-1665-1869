<div class="ocr-text">XLVII. An Account of a remarkable Echinus: By Gustavus Brander, Esq; F. R. S.

Read Dec. 11, 1755.

This echinus is of a very singular species. It appears to me to be of a middling nature between the echinus and the star-fish. It comes from the island of Bourbon in the East-Indies; and I cannot learn, that it is anywhere described. (Plate VIII. Fig. 3.)

XLVIII. An Account of the Impression on a Stone dug up in the Island of Antigua, and the Quantity of Rain fallen there for Four Years: In a Letter from the Reverend Mr. Francis Byam to William Fauquier, Esq; F. R. S.

Dear Brother,

Antigua, March 31, 1755.

As you have the honour to be a member of the Royal Society, I have sent you, by Captain Barrett, in a box directed for you, what I esteem to be a great curiosity. It is a stone, that was brought from a quarry, for a building in the town: the quarry is in the side of a mountain, and is about three hundred yards higher than high-water mark, and about two miles from the sea. When the mason struck it with his hammer, it split in two, and discovered the exact portraiture of a fish (on each stone) which we call an old wife. (Plate IX.) I have likewise sent you an account of the quantity of rain, that has fallen in this place for four years last past.</div>
