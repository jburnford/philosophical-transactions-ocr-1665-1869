<div class="ocr-text">IV. An Extract of a Letter from the late Mr. Edw. Lhwyd to Dr. Tancred Robinson; giving an Account of some uncommon Plants growing about Pensans and St. Ives in Cornwall.

Pensans, Sept. 22. 1706.

SIR,

I have met with no Birds or Fish, since our coming hither, that I suspect for undescribed: Only two or three Stella, and some other Exanguia marina have occur&#x27;d, which I have not seen before on our British Coasts.

We have also met with the Capillus Veneris versus in abundance on the Sea Cliffs about St. Ives. 2. Dr. Shepherd&#x27;s Scrophularia Scorodonica folio. 3. Blattaria lutea; an Intea minor Park? But the Leaves of ours are not jagged: Also all the Plants mentioned by Mr Ray to grow here; excepting the Gnaphalium marinum, which should grow by this Town; and two or three more, which being at some distance, we have not looked for.

We have also found some Fuci, which perhaps may be new: And I am told the Fishermen sometimes take up the Corallina marina reticulata by their Hooks; but I have not yet seen one of them.

E. LHWYD.</div>
