<div class="ocr-text">VIII. A catalogue of nebulæ and clusters of stars in the southern hemisphere, observed at Paramatta in New South Wales, by James Dunlop, Esq. In a letter addressed to Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, Bart. K.C.B. late Governor of New South Wales. Presented to the Royal Society by John Frederick William Herschel, Esq. Vice President.

Read December 20, 1827.

The following nebulæ and clusters of stars in the southern hemisphere were observed by me at my house in Paramatta, situated about $6&#x27;&#x27;$ of a degree south and about $1^{\circ}.78$ of time east of the Brisbane Observatory. The observations were made in the open air, with an excellent 9-feet reflecting telescope, the clear aperture of the large mirror being nine inches. This telescope was occasionally fitted up as a meridian telescope, with a strong iron axis firmly attached to the lower side of the tube nearly opposite the cell of the large mirror, and the ends of the axis rested in brass Y&#x27;s, which were screwed to blocks of wood let into the ground about 18 inches, and projecting about 4 inches above the ground; one end of the axis carried a brass semicircle divided into half degrees and read off by a vernier to minutes. The position and index error of the instrument were ascertained by the passage of known stars. The eye end of the telescope was raised or lowered by a cord over a pulley attached to a strong wooden post let into the ground about two feet: with this apparatus I have observed a sweep of eight or ten degrees in breadth with very little deviation of the instrument from the plane of the meridian, and the tremor was very little even with a considerable magnifying power. I made drawings or representations of a great number of the nebulæ and clusters at the time of observation, several of which are annexed to this paper; and also very correct drawings of the Nebulæ major and minor, together with a representation of the milky nebulosity surrounding the star $\eta$ Robur Caroli. The places of the

MDCCCXXVIII.
small stars in the Nebulæ major and minor, and also those accompanying the η Robur Caroli, I ascertained by the mural circle in the year 1825, at which time I was preparing to commence a general survey of the southern hemisphere. These stars being laid down upon the chart, enabled me to delineate the nebulosity very accurately.

The nebulae are arranged in the order of their south polar distances to the nearest minute for 1827, and in zones for each degree in the order of their right ascension. The column on the right hand shows the number of times the object has been observed.

The reductions and arrangement have been principally made since my return to Europe; and I trust this catalogue of the nebulae will be found an acceptable addition to that knowledge which the Brisbane observatory has been the means of putting the world in possession of, respecting that important and hitherto but little known portion of the heavens.

| 67  | 12 11 4 | 18 24 | A star of the 6th magnitude, with a beautiful well-defined milky ray proceeding from it south following; the ray is conical, and the star appears in the point of the cone, and the broad or south following extremity is circular, or rounded off. The ray is about 7&#x27; in length, and nearly 2&#x27; in breadth at the broadest part, near the southern extremity. With the sweeping power this appears like a star with a very faint milky ray south following, the ray gradually spreading in breadth from the star, and rounded off at the broader end. But with a higher power it is not a star with a ray, but a very faint nebula, and the star is not involved or connected with it: I should call it a very faint nebula of a long oval shape, the smaller end towards the star; this is easily resolvable into extremely minute points or stars, but I cannot discover the slightest indications of attraction or condensation towards any part of it. I certainly had not the least suspicion of this object being resolvable when I discovered it with the sweeping power, nor even when I examined it a second time; it is a beautiful object, of a uniform faint light.

| 261 | 18°49&#x27;25&quot; | 25°35&#x27; | A very minute double nebula, the distance between them about 15&#x27;&#x27; of a degree; the largest or following of the two is not more than 10&#x27;&#x27; diameter; each of them has a small bright point or nucleus. |
| 262 | 18°51&#x27;30&quot; | 25°53&#x27; | A pretty large very faint nebula, about 5&#x27; or 6&#x27; diameter, slightly bright towards the centre; a minute star is north of the nebula, and two stars of the 7th magnitude preceding. |
| 263 | 21°19&#x27;0&quot; | 25°23&#x27; | A small faint round nebula, 20&#x27;&#x27; diameter, a little brighter in the middle, following a group of pretty bright stars. |
| 264 | 4°15&#x27;13&quot; | 26°30&#x27; | A faint round nebula, about 40&#x27;&#x27; diameter, slightly bright to the centre; this is north preceding θ Rhomboidis. |
| 265 | 9°54&#x27;8&quot; | 26°1&#x27; | A very bright round nebula, about 3&#x27; or 4&#x27; diameter, very gradually bright to the centre. This has a fine globular appearance. |
| 266 | 11°40&#x27;9&quot; | 26°8&#x27; | A very small nebula, very bright immediately at the centre; the bright point is nearly equal in brightness to one of the minute stars north of the nebula. I do not think the bright point is a star, but a very highly condensed nucleus, surrounded by a faint chevelure, not more than 10&#x27;&#x27; diameter. Another very minute nebula precedes this. |
| 267 | 11°39&#x27;35&quot; | 26°11&#x27; | An extremely small round nebula, not more than 5&#x27;&#x27; diameter, equally and uniformly bright, with a small well-defined planetary disc, with no bright point or condensation to the centre. This is not a small star; the appearance is very different from any of the small stars near it, and it is also very unlike the general appearance of small nebulæ: both of these objects are very singular. |
| 268 | 15°36&#x27;8&quot; | 26°7&#x27; | A very faint nebula, about 1&#x27; diameter, with a very minute star preceding, and another following; both are involved. |
| 269 | 16°43&#x27;0&quot; | 26°39&#x27; | A small round faint nebula, about 15&#x27;&#x27; diameter, with a minute star near the south side, and four small stars following. The nebula is in the point of a cone formed by the four small stars and itself. |
| 270 | 23°41&#x27;16&quot; | 26°59&#x27; | A faint ray of nebula, about 25&#x27;&#x27; or 30&#x27;&#x27; long, with a small star in the centre of it.—Figure 9. |
| 271 | 11°11&#x27;36&quot; | 27°28&#x27; | A rather bright nebula, about 2½&#x27; or 3&#x27; long and 1&#x27; broad, in the form of a crescent, the convex side preceding; no condensation of the nebulous matter towards any point. This is easily resolvable into many stars of some considerable magnitude, arranged in pretty regular lines, with the nebula remaining, which is also resolvable into extremely minute stars. This is probably two clusters in the same line.—Figure 10. |
| 272 | 12°31&#x27;— | 27°55&#x27; | A group of five stars of the 8th or 9th magnitude, with a great number of extremely small stars resembling faint nebulæ, 3&#x27; or 4&#x27; diameter. |
| 273 | 13°34&#x27;48&quot; | 27°57&#x27; | (201 Centauri, Bode.) This is a curved line of small stars, about 1½&#x27; long, with a star of the 7th magnitude in the north extremity; a group of extremely minute stars on the preceding side of the crescent, and a multitude of very minute stars extended preceding and following.—Figure 11. |

| 276 | 15h 14m 0s | 27° 50&#x27; | A very small nebula, with a very minute star involved in the north side of it: the star is not central; another small star is distant about 4&#x27; from the nebula. |
| 277 | 15h 28m 9s | 27° 51&#x27; | A faint extended nebula, about 4&#x27; long and 2&#x27; broad, with a group of seven or eight extremely small stars in it. |
| 278 | 16h 19m 7s | 27° 18&#x27; | A pretty well-defined small nebula, extended in the parallel of the equator, rather a little south preceding, and north following, about 1½ long, and 2½&quot; broad, with a star of the 11th or 12th magnitude in the centre. The nebula is nearly equally bright, and the star is in the centre.—Figure 12. |
| 279 | 17h 26m 0s | 27° 35&#x27; | A pretty large faint nebula, round figure, about 3&#x27; diameter; very faint at the margin. |
| 280 | 19h 14m 21s | 27° 24&#x27; | An extremely faint ill-defined nebula, of an irregular figure, rather elongated following: there are two minute stars involved in the preceding side of it. |
| 281 | 11h 10m 16s | 28° 20&#x27; | A cluster of very small stars, a little elongated preceding and following, about 10&#x27; diameter; the stars are congregated towards the centre, a pretty bright star south, and a double star south following this. |
| 282 | 13h 42m — | 28° 57&#x27; | A group of ten or twelve stars about the 10th magnitude, with a multitude of very small stars, forming an irregular branched figure, 8&#x27; or 10&#x27; long and 6&#x27; broad. |
| 283 | 14h 47m 0s | 28° 59&#x27; | A group of small stars forming a semicircle, with a line of minute stars joining the extremities. |

| 285 | 15h 59m 4s | 28° 40&#x27; | A very faint small round nebula, about 8&quot; or 10&quot; diameter; a little brighter in the centre. |
| 286 | 16h 31m 12s | 28° 29&#x27; | An exceedingly faint very small round nebula, about 12&quot; diameter, with a minute bright point in the centre. This is south of a star of the 7-8th magnitude, and a nebula follows in the field. |
| 287 | 16h 35m 3s | 28° 32&#x27; | A faint elliptical nebula, about 25&quot; diameter, not bright at the centre, and nearly uniform in its light. |
| 288 | 21h 20m 12s | 28° 28&#x27; | A pretty bright small elliptical nebula, about 20&quot; long; the brightest part is near the south following extremity. This precedes a small star. |
| 289 | 11h 29m 20s | 29° 16&#x27; | A pretty large cluster of stars of mixt magnitudes, about 10&#x27; diameter. The greater number of the stars are of a pale white colour. There is a red star near the preceding side; another of the same size and colour near the following side; another small red star near the centre; and a yellow star near the south following extremity, all in the cluster. |

| 290 | 11 36 11 | 29 46 | A very faint nebula, round figure, about $1\frac{1}{2}$ diameter, with two or three very small stars involved in it. There are many similar small stars scattered in the field with a power of 170; the nebulosity is extremely faint. This precedes the 49 Centauri, Bode, which is a star of the 4th or 5th magnitude, and not of the 6th as given in Bode&#x27;s catalogue. |
| 291 | 11 56 9 | 29 45 | A cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes, irregular figure, about 6&#x27; long and 4&#x27; broad. |
| 292 | 12 15 0 | 29 2 | A pretty cluster of extremely small stars, resembling a pretty large faint nebula, about 6&#x27; or 7&#x27; diameter; the compression is very gradual to the centre; a pretty bright star is in the following side of the cluster, round figure. |
| 293 | 15 49 5 | 29 3 | A very faint small nebula, about 10&#x27;&#x27; diameter, with a small star near the south margin, but not involved. |

The bright part at the centre is occasioned by a group of stars of some considerable magnitude when compared with those of the nebula. I am inclined to think that this may be two clusters in the same line; the bright part is a little south of the centre of the large nebula. |
| 296 | 4 42 11 | 30 40 | A faint ill-defined nebula, with a small bright point in the preceding side, which I suspect to be a star; there are several similar small stars in the field. |
| 297 | 9 56 0 | 30 50 | A beautiful cluster of stars, arranged in curvilinear lines intersecting each other, about 40&#x27; diameter, extended south preceding, and north following. |
| 298 | 10 47 9 | 30 10 | A very faint nebula, of an oblong rectangular figure, extended in the direction of the meridian. |
| 299 | 11 22 36 | 30 14 | An extremely faint ray of nebula, about 2&#x27; in length, with a very small star at the following extremity; three pretty bright small stars distant about 1&#x27;, and a star of the 7th magnitude south preceding. |
| 300 | 12 19 50 | 30 51 | A triangular group of very small stars, about 3&#x27; long, resembling faint nebulae. A star of the 9th magnitude near the north following extremity. |
| 301 | 12 44 — | 30 35 | (X Crucis, Bode) is five stars of the 7th magnitude, forming a triangular figure, and a star of the 9th magnitude between the second and third, with a multitude of very small stars on the south side.—Figure 13. is a very correct representation. |
| 302 | 14 16 40 | 30 3 | A cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes, considerably congregated towards the centre, 4&#x27; or 5&#x27; diameter. |
| 303 | 15 21 23 | 30 32 | A very small faint nebula, 10&#x27;&#x27; or 1.2&#x27;&#x27; diameter, a little brighter in the middle. A small star precedes this, and a star of the 7th magnitude following. |

| 304 | 15 49 —  | 30 0  | (λ Circini, Bode) Lacaille describes this as three small stars in a line with nebula. No particular nebula exists in this place. A group of about twenty stars of mixt magnitudes, forming an irregular figure, about 5&#x27; or 6&#x27; long, answer to the place of the λ. This is in the milky way; and there is no nebula in the group of stars except what is common in the neighbourhood. |
| 305 | 17 29 30 | 30 27 | A very small round nebula, with a minute bright point near the following side. The bright point is not in the centre of the nebula, a pretty bright small star following distance 1&#x27; of arc. |
| 306 | 4 9 8    | 31 38 | A small round pretty well defined nebula, 10&quot; or 12&quot; diameter, slightly bright to the centre, a bright star in the field south following. |
| 307 | 4 49 12  | 31 37 | An extremely faint round nebula, 30&quot; or 40&quot; diameter. |
| 308 | 10 15 48 | 31 10 | A very small round nebula, about 25&quot; diameter, bright at the centre, nearly in a line between two very small stars. A star of the 6-7th magnitude is south following. |
| 309 | 10 38 —  | 31 13 | (η Roboris Caroli, Bode) is a bright star of the 3rd magnitude, surrounded by a multitude of small stars, and pretty strong nebulosity; very similar in its nature to that in Orion, but not so bright. Figure 14. is a very correct representation of it; the circle A B is about 1° and 37&#x27; diameter, with the star η in the centre. I can count twelve or fourteen extremely minute stars surrounding η in the space of about 1&#x27;; several of them appear close to the disk: there is a pretty bright small star about the 10th magnitude north following the η, and distant about 1&#x27;. The nebulosity is pretty strongly marked; that on the south side is very unequal in brightness, and the different portions of the nebulosity are completely detached, as represented in the figure. There is much nebulosity in this place, and very much extensive nebulosity throughout the Robur Caroli, which is also very rich in small stars. |
| 310 | 10 47 0  | 31 42 | A faint nebula, about 1½&#x27; or 2&#x27; diameter, with a small bright star near the preceding side; this is resolvable into exceedingly minute stars. |
| 311 | 12 50 30 | 31 15 | A very faint pretty large nebula, about 6&#x27; or 8&#x27; diameter, round figure, resolvable into very minute stars. Several stars of some considerable magnitude appear scattered among the minute stars of the nebula, but they are only the continuation of a branch of small stars which run over the place where the nebula is; the stars in the nebula are very gradually, but not much, compressed to the centre. |
| 312 | 13 16 7  | 31 38 | A pretty large faint nebula, about 5&#x27; diameter, irregular branched figure, resolvable, with considerable compression of the stars towards the central point. This precedes a star of the 7th magnitude, and a group of small stars follow, about 10&#x27; north of the nebula. |
| 313 | 14 16 14 | 31 5  | A very minute group of small stars, about 2&#x27; long, extended in the parallel of the equator. |
| 314 | 15 9 —   | 31 29 | (16 Circini, Bode) described in the Connaissance des Tems as nebula, with two small stars in it. There are three stars of the 8th magnitude very near each other, forming a triangle, which answers to the place. |

| 315 | 15h 21m 30s | 31° 55&#x27; | A small rather faint nebula, 20&quot; or 25&quot; diameter, at the preceding extremity of a line of four or five very small stars. |
| 316 | 16h 29m 6s | 31° 45&#x27; | A very faint ray of nebula, about 1½ long, and 15&quot; or 20&quot; broad, extended north preceding and south following, with rather a condensation of the nebulous matter near the south following extremity. There is a minute star near the north preceding extremity, but I do not think it is involved in the ray. |
| 317 | 17h 43m 28s | 31° 11&#x27; | A faint ill-defined round nebula, very faint at the margin, perhaps 1½ or 2&#x27; diameter. |
| 318 | 17h 53m — | 31° 43&#x27; | A group of eighteen or twenty small stars of nearly equal magnitudes, extended 8&#x27; long, and 4&#x27; broad. |
| 319 | 22h 7m 20s | 31° 58&#x27; | A very small cluster of very minute stars, resembling a small faint nebula, 2&#x27; diameter. |

| 321 | 10h 27m 13s | 32° 37&#x27; | A very small cluster of very small bright stars; round figure, about 4&#x27; diameter; rich in extremely small stars resembling faint nebula. |
| 322 | 10h 30m 7s | 32° 17&#x27; | A star of the 7th magnitude, involved in faint nebula. |
| 323 | 10h 59m — | 32° 16&#x27; | (5 Centauri, Bode) is a very large cluster of stars about the 9th magnitude, with a red star of the 7—8th magnitude, north following the centre of the cluster. Elliptical figure: the stars are pretty regularly scattered. |
| 324 | 11h 17m 0s | 32° 43&#x27; | Seven or eight small stars in a line oblique to the equator. |
| 325 | 11h 32m — | 32° 19&#x27; | A cluster of stars in strong milky nebulosity. |
| 326 | 16h 5m 21s | 32° 28&#x27; | A group of very small stars of an irregular branched figure, 15&#x27; or 20&#x27; diameter. The central part is very thin of stars. |
| 327 | 17h 48m 16s | 32° 26&#x27; | A very faint nebula, rather extended north, about 30&quot; or 40&quot; long. |
| 328 | 19h 15m 46s | 32° 41&#x27; | A small faint nebula, about 20&quot; diameter, with a minute star in the preceding margin. |
| 329 | 21h 19m — | 32° 19&#x27; | (47 Indi, Bode). This is described as two small stars in nebula. I can find no nebula in this place; but there are three small stars forming an obtuse triangle, which answers to the place of 47 Indi. There is also an angular line of very minute stars, about 1&#x27; in length, following about 2&#x27; or 3&#x27; in time, and 30&#x27; south, which would have a nebulous appearance through a small telescope. |
| 330 | 9h 22m 30s | 33° 46&#x27; | A faint cluster of small stars of mixed magnitude, with two or three pretty bright stars in it. This answers to 485 Argus (Bode), and is described as a small star surrounded by nebula. This precedes 492 Argus, about 3&#x27; in RA, and 3&#x27; or 4&#x27; north of the star, and is probably the object intended; the cluster is about 5&#x27; diameter, irregular figure, no nebula. |

These two nebulae are completely distinct from each other, and no connection of the nebulous matters between them. There is a very minute star in the dark space between the preceding extremities of the nebula: they are extended in the parallel of the equator nearly.—Figure 20. is a good representation. | 7          |

| 506 | 18h 33m 13s | +48° 30&#x27; | A very faint nebula, about 25&quot; diameter. I suspect a very feeble ray proceeding towards the other nebula, but not connected. This nebula is rather confused and ill-defined. |
| 507 | 0h 6m 50s | +49° 50&#x27; | A beautiful long nebula, about 25&quot; in length; position north preceding, and south following, a little brighter towards the middle, but extremely faint and diluted to the extremities. I see several minute points or stars in it, as it were through the nebula: the nebulous matter of the south extremity is extremely rare, and of a delicate bluish hue. This is a beautiful object.—Figure 21. |
| 508 | 5h 7m 0s | +49° 45&#x27; | An exceedingly bright, round, well-defined nebula, about 1½&#x27; diameter, exceedingly condensed, almost to the very margin. This is the brightest small nebula that I have seen. I tried several magnifying powers on this beautiful globe; a considerable portion round the margin is resolvable, but the compression to the centre is so great, that I cannot reasonably expect to separate the stars. I compared this with the 68 Conn. des Tems, and this nebula greatly exceeds the 68 in condensation and brightness. |

With a higher power it has a considerable hairy appearance; it is very different from a star of the same magnitude, and is not dusky, but rather pale; preceding ω Lupi about 6½&#x27; in RA, and 6&#x27; or 7&#x27; north of the star. |

The Nebula Minor, to the naked eye, has very much the appearance of a small cirrus-cloud; and through the telescope, it has very much the appearance of one of the brighter portions of the milky way, although it is not so rich in stars of all the variety of small magnitudes, with which the brighter parts of the milky way in general abound, and therefore it is probably a beautiful specimen of the nebulosity of which the remote portion of that magnificent zone is composed.

Plate IV. is a very correct drawing of the nebula, which if faithfully represented by the engraver, will convey a better idea of it than I could possibly hope to do by words.

Its situation in the heavens is between $0^h\ 27&#x27;$ and $1^h\ 6&#x27;$ or $7&#x27;$ in right ascension, and between $74^\circ\ 30&#x27;$ and $72^\circ\ 53&#x27;$ in south declination. Its position is oblique to the equator, south preceding and north following; and its form is nearly that of a parallelogram about two degrees long and fully one degree broad, and may be arranged according to its natural general appearance, into bright, faint, and very faint nebulosity. The bright nebula forms the south extremity and the preceding side, and is equal to the breadth of the nebula at the south end, and gradually diminishing in breadth and brightness till it terminates in an accumulation of the nebulous matter in the north extremity. The bright portion of the nebulous matter is not uniformly bright, but has something the appearance of small cumular clouds, although not very decidedly marked, and which I cannot well delineate. The faint nebula which is on the following side, is broad at the north extremity and gradually diminishing in breadth to where, with the other faint shade, it joins the following side of the brighter portion of the nebula, near the south extremity. The very faint shade is also on the following side, and extends from the northern to the southern extremity of the nebula, and is rather more strongly marked at what I would call its terminating border, than where it joins or blends with the faint shade; and I suspect it is faintly connected with a patch of faint nebula which follows at a little distance, and is represented in the figure.

There are two pretty bright small nebulae situated in the following margin of the bright shade, and a considerable number of faint nebulae and accumulations of the nebulous matter variously situated throughout, and also in the patch which follows; but they are described in the general catalogue.
The figure of the Nebula Major is so irregular, and divided into so many parcels, that without the assistance of letters of reference it will be impossible for me to attempt a description. However, the appearance and construction of the different nebulæ which compose it, are more minutely described in the general catalogue. I will here only attempt to describe the apparent connection of one portion or branch of the nebulous matter with another. I find the existence of extensively diffused faint nebulosity throughout a great portion of this quarter of the heavens, from the Robur Caroli to the Nebula Major, and I can even trace its existence in the vicinity of Nebula Minor.

The Nebula Major is situated between $4^h\ 46&#x27;$ and $6^h\ 3&#x27;$ in right ascension, and between $66^\circ\ 30&#x27;$ and $71^\circ\ 30&#x27;$ of south declination; but the body or principal portion of the nebula is situated between $5^h\ 7&#x27;$ and $5^h\ 40&#x27;$ in right ascension, and between $69^\circ$ and $71^\circ$ of south declination, and is composed of very strong bright nebula, very rich in small nebulæ and clustering stars of all the variety of small magnitudes: I compared this portion of the nebula with Sobieski&#x27;s Shield, which in this latitude is near the zenith. The observation says, &quot;The Nebula Major very much resembles the brightness in Sobieski&#x27;s Shield; it is scarcely so large, but I think it is equally bright.&quot; Another observation says, &quot;The ridge or brighter portion of Nebula Major is more condensed than the Shield.&quot; Plate V. is a correct representation of Nebula Major.

The bright ridge or body of the nebula is extended obliquely to the equator, north preceding and south following, and the following extremity breaks off rather suddenly, faint, decreasing in brightness in a south following direction to the distance of fully a degree and a half towards the star $\beta$, which is slightly involved in the narrow extremity: preceding the star marked $\gamma$, a considerable increase of the brightness of the nebulous matter takes place; another accumulation takes place at $\delta$ about $15&#x27;$ diameter. There is a small star north with a small nebula preceding, but neither of them are involved in the accumulation of the nebulous matter. $\delta$ and $\varepsilon$ are connected by streams of unequal brightness, $\varepsilon$ is pretty large and is rich in small stars and nebulæ: opposite $\delta$ and $\varepsilon$, towards the principal body of the nebula, the nebulous matter is very faint and of unequal brightness; $\varepsilon$ is south following a beautiful group of nebulæ of various forms and magnitudes, on a ground of strong nebulosity common to all, with the 30 Doradûs (Bode) in the centre,
South of the 30 Doradûs a pretty bright accumulation of the nebulous matter takes place, extended, preceding and following, and is joined by pretty strong nebula to the arm \( z \), which proceeds in a northerly direction from the body of the nebula; the bright star near the north extremity of the arm is not involved in the bright nebula. Between the arms \( z \) and \( \lambda \) the nebula is very faint, and the bright accumulations of the nebulous matter on the north side are all connected together by nebulosity of various brightness, and are connected to the main body by the arms \( z \) and \( \lambda \); and I strongly suspect the nebula at \( \phi \) is connected by very faint nebula with the group surrounding the 30 Doradûs.

The accumulation of the nebulous matter at \( \xi \) is connected with the preceding extremity of the body of the nebula, by nebula increasing in brightness towards the neck of the body, but I cannot say that the \( \psi \) is connected with the \( \xi \).

Two arms proceed from the neck towards the south, which are connected by faint nebula between them, which gradually increases in brightness towards the junction of the arms; between the arm \( \eta \) and the body the nebulosity is faint, of various shades of brightness, and from the arms \( \eta \) and \( \nu \), to the head \( \xi \), the nebulosity is of various degrees of brightness.

I have made a very good general representation of the various appearances of the milky way, from the Robur Caroli to where it crosses the zenith in Scorpio. Plates VI. VII. and VIII. This was generally made by the naked eye, except in particular places where I suspected an opening or separation of the nebulous matter, when I applied the telescope. However, the dark space on the east side of the Cross, or the black cloud as it is called, is very accurately laid down by the telescope: the darkness in this space is occasioned by a vacancy or want of stars; it contains only two or three of the 7th magnitude, and very few of the 8th or 9th magnitude. I may here remark that the Nebula Minor is not so bright as the Nebula Major.

Neither of the two nebulæ, Major and Minor, are at present in the place assigned to them by Lacaille; and it has been suspected that nebulous appearances change their form and also their situation. Yet, although the situation of these nebulæ, as given by Lacaille and compared with their present situation, would be favourable to such a surmise, still we must consider the dimensions of the instruments with which he made his observations, and make a reasonable allowance.
However, the 30 Doradûs is at present involved in pretty strong and pretty bright nebula, and is also situated very near the brightest part of the Nebula Major; and it would be singular if its relative situation was the same when Lacaille observed it as it at present is; that he should have assigned to it a place in the Dorado and not in the Nebula Major, to which, from its nature, it was not only nearly allied, but in which it was actually involved. This circumstance, it must be confessed, is favourable to the conjecture; and the 47 Toucani is similarly situated, with respect to distance, from the Nebula Minor, although it is not involved in nebulosity or connected with the nebula.

When reflecting on these circumstances, I was led to examine the present state of these nebulæ, and find that scarcely any nebulæ exist in a high state of condensation, and very few in a state of moderate condensation towards the centre. A considerable number appear a little brighter towards the centre, and several have minute bright points immediately at the centre. Others have small or very minute stars variously situated in them, but many of those bright points in, or near, the centre may be stars, for the Nebula Major in particular is very rich in small stars. But the greater number of the nebulæ appear only like condensations of the general nebulous matter, into faint nebulæ of various forms and magnitudes, generally not well defined; and many of the larger nebulous appearances are resolvable into stars of mixed small magnitudes; and a great portion of the large cloud is resolvable into innumerable stars of all the variety of small magnitudes with strong nebula remaining, very similar to the brighter parts of the milky way. And whether the remaining nebulous appearance may not be occasioned by millions of stars disguised by their distance, is what I cannot say.

But a critical examination of these nebulæ would not only be a valuable treasure for the present generation to possess, but an invaluable inheritance for them to transmit to posterity. For it must be by the comparison of observations, made at distant periods of time, that we can draw any satisfactory conclusions concerning the breaking up or the greater condensation of the nebulous matter. It seems beyond a doubt that stars must assume a nebulous appearance when situated at immense distances; but whether all nebulous appearances are occasioned by stars, is a problem apparently beyond the reach of man to resolve, without the assistance of analogy, which ought not to be
trusted too freely, especially with objects almost equally beyond the reach of our hands and telescopes. Several of the very faint and delicate nebulæ can be resolved into stars, and also many of the brighter nebulæ are composed of stars: but there are a greater number which have not yet been resolved or shown to consist of stars; and it is not improbable, that &quot;shining matter may exist in a state different from that of the starry.&quot;

P.S. Plate IX. has been added, at the suggestion of Mr. Herschel, to illustrate the distribution of the Southern Nebulae. The nebulæ are laid down without any regard to their form, magnitude, brightness, or nature; and but little to their strict places, only so far as to cause every rectangular space on the map, which occupies one degree in Polar distance and one hour in Right ascension, to contain the same number of nebulæ as actually occur in the heavens, according to the observations detailed in this paper; the object of the plate being solely to give an idea of their arrangement generally in the heavens.</div>
