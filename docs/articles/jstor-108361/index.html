By Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., F.R.S.

Received April 17,—Read April 18, 1844.

§ 10. Observations made on Board Her Majesty&#x27;s Ships Erebus and Terror, from June 1841 to August 1842, in the Antarctic Expedition under the command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross, R.N., F.R.S.

I HAVE now to lay before the Royal Society the results of the Magnetic Observations made at sea by the Antarctic Expedition during the second year of its operations in the southern hemisphere. Leaving Hobarton early in July 1841, the ships proceeded in the first instance to Sydney in Australia, and from thence to the Bay of Islands in New Zealand, where they remained until the return of the season of navigation in the high latitudes. Quitting New Zealand in November, the ice was met with and entered in a somewhat lower latitude than in the preceding year, and in a longitude considerably to the east of the former track. The obstacles which the ice presented to their progress appear to have been greater than on the former occasion; they were however surmounted, and in February 1842 the ships again reached the ice barrier, or glacier, in latitude 78°, by which they had been stopped in the preceding year. After an unsuccessful endeavour to turn the eastern extremity of the glacier, the advance of the season compelled their return to the lower latitudes; they quitted the Antarctic Circle in March 1842, and keeping nearly in the 60th parallel, crossed the whole breadth of the southern Pacific Ocean to the Falkland Islands, where they arrived in April.

I proceed at once to the examination in detail of the magnetic observations made during this period.

Deductions of the Constants \(a\) and \(b\) in the Corrections for the Ship&#x27;s attraction.

1. In the Erebus.—For the constants \(a\) and \(b\) to be employed in computing the corrections of the declination, we have the observations on each of the 32 principal points of the compass at Hobarton, in October 1840 and June 1841. We have also a similar series at Port Louis, in the Falkland Islands, in August 1842. The observations at Hobarton have been already discussed in No. V.* Those at Port Louis were as follows:

August 19, 1842.

The values of the constants deduced from the observations at Hobarton were, \(a = +0.0272\); \(b = +0.986\). The values from the observations at the Falkland Islands are, \(a = +0.0292\); \(b = +0.984\).

The values of \(a\) at Hobarton were derived from two series, one in October 1840, when the ship had recently passed through the low magnetic latitudes, and the other in June 1841, on her return from the highest magnetic latitudes of the southern hemisphere; the two series separately considered give \(a = +0.0235\) in 1840, and &#x27;0309 in 1841; we have therefore the following values:

+0.0267 in the Thames, where the ship had been stationary for several years.
+0.0235 at Hobarton, on her first arrival from the low latitudes.
+0.0305 on her return to Hobarton from the very high southern magnetic latitudes.
+0.0292 at the Falkland Islands in 1842, on her second return from the very high southern latitudes.

The variations in these values is in accordance with the view expressed in the preceding Number of these Contributions†; that when a ship changes her magnetic latitude, the corresponding change in the induced portion of her magnetism may not be instantaneous; that some portions of her iron may be of a quality intermediate between perfectly soft iron, which would undergo instantaneous change, and iron permanently magnetic; and that when changing rapidly her geographical position, she may be liable to be more or less in arrear, in regard to her magnetic condition, of her actual locality at any particular time. In a ship in which this should be the case, a table computed with any one value of \(a\) would not apply equally to one portion

† Ibid. pp. 152, 153.
of her voyage in which she might be sailing from lower into higher inclinations, and to another portion in which she might be returning from higher into lower magnetic latitudes. The voyage under consideration comprised two such portions; and I have therefore employed two tables for the Erebus, one computed with &#x27;0267 for the period when the ship was increasing the dip, and the other with &#x27;0288 for the period when she was decreasing the dip. The differences are insignificant, except when the inclination is very high; the greater part of the declinations observed in the high dips were antecedent to the 1st of March 1842, when the ship commenced her return to the lower latitudes; for these the table computed with $a = &#x27;0267$ has been employed, and appears to answer better than the corrections computed either by the values resulting from the observations at Hobarton before the commencement, or by those at the Falkland Islands after the conclusion of the voyage.

2. In the Terror.—For the values of $a$ and $b$ in the Terror, we have observations on each of the thirty-two principal points of the compass at Hobarton in October 1840, and a second series in June 1841, as follows:

We have also a series at Port Louis, in the Falkland Islands, in August 1842, as follows:

From these observations we have the following values of the constants:

Hobarton . . . . . . \(a = +0.0275; b = +0.979\)
Falkland Islands . . . \(a = +0.0293; b = +0.994\).

These values are nearly the same as those derived from the observations in the Erebus at the same periods, and appear to require no special remark; the same tables have been employed in the declination corrections of both ships during the voyage under notice; the values of the constants in these tables were as follows:

\(a = 0.0267\) when the ships were sailing from the lower into the higher latitudes;
\(a = 0.0288\) when sailing from the higher into the lower latitudes; \(b = +0.984\) in both cases.

**Deduction of the Corrections on account of the Ship’s attraction for the Observations of Inclination.**

1. **In the Erebus.**—The spot in the ship in which Mr. Fox’s apparatus for the observations of inclination and intensity was employed, was a few feet in advance (towards the bow), and about two feet lower in height, than the position of the standard compass.

The values of \(a\) and \(b\) derived from the observations with the compass needle apply in strictness only to the spot in which that compass was stationed; it may be proper, therefore, before we employ them for the observations with Mr. Fox’s apparatus, to show that nearly similar values for the constant \(a\) in particular (the more important constant) are deducible from the observations of inclination and intensity, independently of those made with the compass needle. For this purpose we may employ equation (1.), Phil. Trans., 1843, Part II. p. 147, viz.

\[
\frac{\phi&#x27;}{A&#x27;} \cos \theta&#x27; \cos \zeta&#x27; = \cos \theta \cos \zeta + a \sin \theta,
\]

obtaining by its means the value of \(a\) from the observations of inclination and intensity made at Hobarton and Port Louis. As \(A&#x27;\) is known to differ very slightly, if at all, from unity, we have from equation (1.),

\[
a \sin \theta = \frac{\phi&#x27;}{\phi} \cos \theta&#x27; \cos \zeta&#x27; - \cos \theta \cos \zeta.
\]

\(\phi\) and \(\theta\) are furnished by the mean of the observations of inclination and intensity on the sixteen points of the compass, having approximate corrections applied to each of them; \(\phi&#x27;\) and \(\theta&#x27;\) by the (uncorrected) observations on the different points.

From the general aspect of the observations at both stations, we may conclude that the same symmetrical distribution of the iron existed in reference to the position of Mr. Fox’s apparatus as in the case of the standard compass, and consequently that at the north and south points the value of \(\zeta&#x27;\) and \(\zeta\) coincided, being equal in the one case to \(0^\circ\), and in the other to \(180^\circ\). At Hobarton (in June 1841) we have \(\phi = 1.83\), \(\theta = -70^\circ 39&#x27;\); \(\phi&#x27;\) at north \(1.812\), at south \(1.854\); \(\theta&#x27;\) at north \(-71^\circ 56&#x27;\), at south \(-69^\circ 14&#x27;\):
Hence at north, $-944a = +307 - 331$; hence $a = +0275$.

At Port Louis (August 1842) we have $\phi = 1°32&#x27;$; $\theta = -52°05&#x27;$; $\phi&#x27;$ at north = $1°279$, at south = $1°346$; $\theta&#x27;$ at north = $-52°50&#x27;$, at south = $-51°33&#x27;$; hence

at north, $-789a = +5920 - 615$; hence $a = +0310$.

The accordance between these values and those deduced from the observations with the standard compass is fully sufficient to justify the inference that the effect of the ship&#x27;s attraction was very nearly the same at the spot where Mr. Fox&#x27;s apparatus was used, as at that at which the standard compass was fixed.

We may obtain $c$ either by equation (11.), Phil. Trans., 1843, Part II. p. 148,

$$c \cos \zeta + d \tan \theta = \sqrt{(\cos \zeta + a \tan \theta)^2 + b^2 \sin^2 \zeta \tan \theta};$$

or from the observations of inclination and intensity, independently of the values of $a$ and $b$, by the equation

$$\frac{\phi&#x27;}{\phi} \sin \theta&#x27; = c \cos \theta \cos \zeta - d \sin \theta.$$

Confining ourselves to the north and south points, and to those points on either side of N. and S. from which $c$ may be most advantageously derived, the observations at Hobarton give the following values to be employed in the equations:

| Direction | $\zeta&#x27;$ | $\zeta$ | $\theta&#x27;$ | $\phi&#x27;$ |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| N.        | 0       | 0      | $-71°56&#x27;$| $1°812$|
| N.N.E.    | $22°30&#x27;$| $21°03&#x27;$| $-71°55&#x27;$| $1°812$|
| N.N.W.    |         |        |          |        |
| N.E.      | $45°0&#x27;$ | $42°12&#x27;$| $-71°48&#x27;$| $1°816$|
| N.W.      |         |        |          |        |
| S.E.      | $135°0&#x27;$| $131°17&#x27;$| $-69°56&#x27;$| $1°847$|
| S.W.      |         |        |          |        |
| S.S.E.    | $157°30&#x27;$| $155°24&#x27;$| $-69°38&#x27;$| $1°850$|
| S.S.W.    |         |        |          |        |
| S.        | $180°0&#x27;$| $180°0&#x27;$| $-69°14&#x27;$| $1°854$|
|           | $-70°39&#x27;$|        |          | $1°83$|

Substituting these values in the first of the above equations (11.), we have at

N. $1°000c - 2°85d = -2°828$;

N.N.E. $934c - 2°85d = -2°832$;

N.W. $741c - 2°85d = -2°841$;

S.E. $660c - 2°85d = -2°853$;
S.S.E. \( \cdot909c - 2\cdot85d = -2\cdot876; \)
S.S.W. \( \cdot1\cdot000c - 2\cdot85d = -2\cdot843. \)

Changing the signs of the three last equations, and summing, we have

\[ 5\cdot24c = +\cdot071; \]

whence \( c = +\cdot014. \)

To obtain \( c \) from the observations of inclination and intensity alone, we have at

N. \( \cdot331c - \cdot94d = -\cdot941; \)
N.N.E. \( \cdot309c - \cdot94d = -\cdot942; \)
N.N.W. \( \cdot222c - \cdot94d = -\cdot943; \)
N.E. \( \cdot218c - \cdot94d = -\cdot948; \)
N.W. \( \cdot301c - \cdot94d = -\cdot948; \)
S.E. \( \cdot331c - \cdot94d = -\cdot947. \)

Changing the signs of the three last equations, and summing, \( d \) is eliminated as before, and

\[ c = \frac{+\cdot017}{1\cdot71} = +\cdot010. \]

From the observations at Port Louis, we have the following values to be employed in the equations:

N. \( \zeta&#x27; = 0; \quad \zeta = 0; \quad \theta = -52^\circ 50&#x27;; \quad \phi&#x27; = 1\cdot279; \)
N.N.E. \( \zeta&#x27; = 22^\circ 30&#x27;; \quad \zeta = 22^\circ 01&#x27;; \quad \theta = -52^\circ 42&#x27;; \quad \phi&#x27; = 1\cdot290; \)
N.N.W. \( \zeta&#x27; = 45^\circ 0&#x27;; \quad \zeta = 43^\circ 58&#x27;; \quad \theta = -52^\circ 45&#x27;; \quad \phi&#x27; = 1\cdot290; \)
N.E. \( \zeta&#x27; = 135^\circ 0&#x27;; \quad \zeta = 133^\circ 03&#x27;; \quad \theta = -51^\circ 59&#x27;; \quad \phi&#x27; = 1\cdot323. \)
S.E. \( \zeta&#x27; = 157^\circ 30&#x27;; \quad \zeta = 155^\circ 52&#x27;; \quad \theta = -51^\circ 33&#x27;; \quad \phi&#x27; = 1\cdot330. \)
S.S.W. \( \zeta&#x27; = 0; \quad \zeta = 0; \quad \theta = -51^\circ 43&#x27;; \quad \phi&#x27; = 1\cdot346. \)
S. \( \zeta&#x27; = 0; \quad \zeta = 0; \quad \theta = -52^\circ 05&#x27;; \quad \phi&#x27; = 1\cdot32. \)

Substituting these values in equation (11.), we obtain

\[ c = \frac{+\cdot094}{5\cdot24} = +\cdot018; \]

or from the observations of inclination and intensity alone,

\[ c = \frac{+\cdot051}{3\cdot22} = +\cdot016. \]
The correspondence in the value of the constants obtained from the observations at Hobarton and Port Louis, being the commencing and concluding stations of the voyage now under consideration, is fully as good as could be desired; and a table formed from them has been employed for the correction of the observations made between Hobarton and the Bay of Islands, and during the return of the Expedition from the high latitudes to the Falkland Islands commencing with the 1st of March 1842. In those portions of the voyage the ship was passing from the higher to the lower magnetic latitudes, in which circumstance they corresponded with the observations at Hobarton and Port Louis, which were both made on the return from the vicinity of the magnetic pole. But if we attempt to apply the same table to the observations made under the reverse circumstances, namely, when the ship was passing from the lower to the higher latitudes (and such was the case with the greater part of the observations which we have to correct in the present voyage), we find that the tabular numbers, where the N. and S. points are approached, furnish a decided over compensation. On days when observations have been made at or near the N. and S. points, if we seek in the table for the corrections which should bring the results in accord with each other, we find that the corrections which will do so belong to a dip which is always some degrees less than the true terrestrial dip. It appeared desirable, therefore, if possible, to form a table for the correction of the observations of this portion of the voyage, derived from those observations themselves. Fortunately we have a better opportunity of doing this than might have been anticipated. The progress of the Expedition was so much impeded by ice in the early part of January 1842, that from the 6th to the 16th inclusive, the Erebus was the whole time between the latitudes of $-65^\circ 54&#x27;$ and $-66^\circ 14&#x27;$, and between the longitudes of $204^\circ 33&#x27;$ and $202^\circ 02&#x27;$; the weather and all other circumstances being favourable, the inclination was observed in the course of those eleven days with the ship&#x27;s head on seventeen different points of the compass, sufficiently distributed, and particularly towards the north points and south points, where the effect of the ship&#x27;s attraction is greatest, and is in opposite directions. From the observations at north and south it is not difficult to obtain an approximate value of $a$, which should bring the corrected results at those points into accord. The value thus obtained is about $+0.023$. I have collected the observations during the period referred to into the following table, taking, for the sake of simplicity, only those observations which were made by the direct method, which, however, comprises by far the greater part of the observations of that period. I have then computed the corrections, first, with the values of the constants, such as they are given by the observations made for their determination at Hobarton and the Falkland Islands (being the commencement and close of the voyage), viz. $a = +0.028$; $b = +0.984$; $c = +0.015$ and $d = 1$; and second, with $a = +0.023$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, as before; and have placed the two series of corrected results in the table, with columns showing in both cases the difference of the corrected result, on each point, from the mean result. A comparison of those columns seems conclusive in favour of the application
of the smaller value of \(a\) to those observations which were made when the ship was in progress from the lower to the higher latitudes. If \(a\) be taken as it was found at Hobarton and the Falkland Islands, not only are the differences generally greater, but they are systematically so; evidencing an over compensation where the north and south points are approached; whilst with the smaller value of \(a\) the differences are greatly diminished in amount, and exhibit no appearance whatsoever of system. They are such as may well be supposed to have been occasioned partly by observation error, and partly by small differences of geographical position in which the observations themselves were made.

The mean of the observations in the table thus corrected is \(-79° 45&#x27;\); the corresponding geographical position is \(-66° 04&#x27;\), and \(203° 17&#x27;5\), if we take as such the middle point of the geographical space in which the ship was detained from the 6th to the 16th of January. The inclination observed on the ice on the 16th of January, in lat. \(-65° 49&#x27;\), long. \(202° 02&#x27;\), with needles whose poles were reversed, was \(-79° 39&#x27;5\).

We can derive no precise conclusion in regard to the value of \(d\), from observations which are not identical in locality; but the accordance of the results obtained on board and on the ice, in geographical positions so little different, is quite sufficient to show that the error involved by assuming \(d\) as unity must be, at the utmost, very inconsiderable.

The tables for the correction of the inclination in the Erebus have therefore been computed with the following values for the constants, viz. from New Zealand to the end of February 1842, being the portion of the voyage in which the ship was in pro-
gress from the lower into the higher inclinations, \(a = +0.023\), \(b = +0.984\), \(c = +0.015\) and \(d = 1\): and for the remainder of the voyage \(a = +0.028\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\), as before.

In the Terror.—The place in which Mr. Fox’s apparatus was used in the Terror was about the same distance from the position of the standard compass, and in the same direction, as in the Erebus. A series of observations were made with it for the purpose of furnishing materials for the determination of the constants, at Hobarton in June 1841, and at the Falkland Islands in August 1842; and the inclination was also observed with the ship’s head on several points of the compass during the detention of the ships by the ice between the 6th and 16th of January 1842. In the case of the Erebus, we have found these latter observations of principal use in furnishing the values of the constants which apply to the greater part of the observations of the voyage; it may, therefore, be advisable to commence with the discussion of the corresponding series in the Terror.

These observations manifest the general systematic character of the disturbance occasioned by the ship’s attraction; they furnish indeed a remarkable example of the success with which the effect of the ship’s iron on the inclination may be investigated by observations made at sea. The disturbance appears to have not been strictly symmetrical, inasmuch as the inclinations observed on the western points somewhat exceed in amount those observed on the corresponding eastern points; the same circumstance took place in the observations at Hobarton; but at the Falkland Islands, on the contrary, the inclinations observed on the eastern points were generally somewhat the higher. A similar occasional departure from strict symmetry has before been noticed in the effect of the ship’s iron on the compass needle*; in that case also

* Philosophical Transactions, 1843, Part II. p. 152.
the disturbance in the same ship was sometimes greater on the eastern, and sometimes on the western points; these small irregularities, having no uniform character, are regarded as included amongst those varying accidents which are classed generally under the name of observation error. It is proper, however, in consequence of this occasional irregularity, that the data from which constants are to be derived for general corrections should consist of the mean of observations on corresponding points on the east and west sides of the compass; in this view we have as available observations in the preceding table those on the following points of the compass.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{North} &amp; \quad -81^\circ 19&#x27;5 \\
\text{N.W.} &amp; \quad -80^\circ 58&#x27;5 \\
\text{N.E.} &amp; \quad -79^\circ 58&#x27;5 \\
\text{W.} \frac{1}{4} \text{S.} &amp; \quad -79^\circ 49&#x27; \\
\text{E.} \frac{1}{4} \text{S. (from E. and E.} \frac{1}{2} \text{S.)} &amp; \quad -79^\circ 29&#x27; \\
\text{W. by S.} &amp; \quad -79^\circ 04&#x27;5 \\
\text{E.S.E.} &amp; \quad -78^\circ 30&#x27;
\end{align*}
\]

We have here $2^\circ 49&#x27;5$ for the difference between the inclinations observed with the ship&#x27;s head north and south; the value of $a$ which will give that amount for the sum of the corrections at north and south when the dip is between $-79^\circ$ and $-80^\circ$, (neglecting $c$ as too small in such case to require consideration), is about $+0.026$. The observations at north were four in number,—those at south six, and on different days,—they were as follows:

| North | South |
|-------|-------|
| January 8, $-81^\circ 19&#x27;$ | January 7, $-78^\circ 28&#x27;$ |
| 8, $-81^\circ 20&#x27;$ | 8, $-78^\circ 31&#x27;$ |
| 8, $-81^\circ 18&#x27;$ | 11, $-78^\circ 28&#x27;$ |
| 13, $-81^\circ 21&#x27;$ | 13, $-78^\circ 25&#x27;$ |
| Mean . . . . . . $81^\circ 19&#x27;5$ | 13, $-78^\circ 33&#x27;$ |
| Mean . . . . . . $78^\circ 30&#x27;$ |

From the accord which these observations respectively exhibit, it is clear that we should not be justified in taking a value of $a$ which should differ much from $+0.026$.

If we now refer to the observations which were made in the Terror soon after her arrival at the Falkland Islands, when the ship&#x27;s head was placed on the principal points of the compass for the purpose of determining the values of the constants, we shall
find that a value of \(a\) taken near \(+0.026\) will by no means bring the results on the N. and S. points, or on those approaching the N. and S. points, into accord; and that as we have already found in the dip corrections of the Erebus, and in the declination corrections of both ships, a considerably higher value of \(a\) is required for the observations on the return from the high latitudes, than for those when the ship was in progress from the lower to the higher dips.

We have no observations at the Falkland Islands (made at the spot in the ship where Mr. Fox&#x27;s apparatus was used) either of the direction of the compass needle, or of the force acting on the horizontal needle: we must therefore obtain \(a\) and \(b\) directly from the observations of Inclination and Intensity. The observations gave as follows:

| Ship&#x27;s head | Inclination observed. \(t = -51^\circ 56&#x27;\). | Intensity observed. \(\phi = 1.336\). |

For \(a\), we have from equation (1.),

\[
a \sin t = \frac{\phi&#x27;}{\phi} \cos \theta&#x27; \cos \zeta&#x27; - \cos \theta \cos \zeta,
\]

whence we obtain, from the observations on the N. and S. points, \(a = +0.0311\), and from those on the N.N.E. and N.N.W., S.S.E. and S.S.W. points, \(a\) also \(= +0.0311\).

In the Erebus we have found \(a\) for the spot in the ship where Mr. Fox&#x27;s apparatus was used \(= +0.023\), from the observations made when the ship was in progress to the southward; and \(= +0.029\) at Hobarton and the Falkland Islands. The corresponding values in the Terror are \(+0.026\) and \(+0.031\).

In the case of the Terror, therefore, I have employed separate tables for the corrections for the ship&#x27;s attraction, viz. \(a\) taken as \(+0.028\) in the passage from Hobarton to New Zealand; as \(+0.026\) in the passage to the higher latitudes; and as \(+0.031\) during the return from the high latitudes to the Falkland Islands.

For \(b\) and \(c\), we obtain from the observations at the Falkland Islands as follows:

In the case of \(b\), we have from equation (2.),

\[
b \cos t = \frac{\phi&#x27;}{\phi} \cos \theta&#x27; \sin \zeta&#x27; \csc \zeta;
\]
the observations at N.E., N.W., S.E. and S.W. give $b = +0.984$; those at E.N.E., W.N.W., E.S.E. and W.S.W., $b = -0.984$; and those at E. and W. $b = -0.982$.

In the case of $c$, we have from equation (3),

$$\frac{\varphi&#x27;}{\varphi} \sin \theta&#x27; = c \cos \theta \cos \zeta + d \sin \theta;$$

from the observations at N. to N.E. and N.W. inclusive, and from S. to S.E. and S.W. inclusive, eliminating $d$, we have

$$c = +0.009.$$

The constant $d$ is perhaps the most difficult of the constants to ascertain satisfactorily, as its value derivable from the observations depends on a knowledge of the true geographical dip at the place of observation, free from what is now known as station error. Experience has fully shown the general fact, that inclinations observed on land cannot safely be assumed as free from local disturbance. The discrepancies of gravitation at the Falkland Islands are well known from the experiments with the pendulum; and from the geological character of these islands, we might be prepared to expect the existence of magnetic discrepancies also. By the needles in both ships, the inclination was found a third of a degree higher at the magnetic observatory on shore than when observed on board in the harbour; if the observatory dip were to be assumed as an undisturbed one, we should obtain $d$ in both ships considerably less than unity, whereas from the comparison of the observations in both ships in the preceding December and January, with the inclination observed at the same time on the ice over a deep sea, where no local attraction can be imagined to exist, we have $d$ (as far as the small differences of geographical position will permit us to judge) differing scarcely, if at all, from unity in either ship. The preference is certainly due to the deduction from the results obtained on the ice. Taking therefore $d = 1$, $c = +0.01$, $b = -0.984$ and $a = +0.026$, we have the corrections, and the corrected inclination, of the observations in the Terror between the 6th and 16th of January as follows:

| Ship&#x27;s head | No. of observations | Inclination observed | Correction | Corrected Inclination |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------|----------------------|
| N.          | 4                   | -81° 19&#x27;             | +1° 26&#x27;    | -79° 53&#x27;5             |
| N.W.        |                     | -80° 58&#x27;5            | +1° 09&#x27;    | -79° 49&#x27;5             |
| N.E.        |                     | -79° 58&#x27;5            | +0° 12&#x27;    | -79° 46&#x27;5             |
| W. ¼ S.     | 9                   | -79° 49&#x27;0            | -0° 01&#x27;    | -79° 50&#x27;0             |
| E. ¼ S.     |                     | -79° 29&#x27;0            | -0° 17&#x27;5   | -79° 56&#x27;5             |
| W. by s.    |                     | -79° 04&#x27;5            | -0° 51&#x27;5   | -79° 56&#x27;0             |
| E. by s.    |                     | -78° 30&#x27;0            | -1° 24&#x27;5   | -79° 54&#x27;5             |

Slight differences in the corrected results must be looked for, as the observations were not all taken precisely at the same geographical spot: those which appear in the table are, however, very slight; the accord produced by the corrections seems as
satisfactory as could be wished or expected; and I have accordingly taken the above stated values of $b$, $c$, and $d$, for the whole period under notice.

On a general review of the examination to which the observations in the Erebus and Terror in this and the preceding voyage have been subjected, in reference to the magnetic influence of their iron, we find reason to conclude from the consistent experience of both voyages, that the disturbance in them was altogether such as would be occasioned by the magnetism induced in the soft iron of the ship by the magnetism of the earth,—if we permit ourselves to include as possessing the quality of softness, certain portions of iron which, though not permanently magnetic, do still retain polarity, and require some time to conform to the changes in magnetical relations induced by changes of geographical position. It is not improbable that this may be a general case in sailing vessels similar to the Erebus and Terror; but we should by no means be warranted in deriving a corresponding inference in regard to ships which contain steam machinery, and still less in the case of iron vessels. These may possibly possess permanent magnetism strictly so called; in addition to induced magnetism, and temporarily-abiding polarity. It is very desirable that we should have some means of judging of what may be expected in vessels of these two classes. The knowledge would be valuable were it only for the compass corrections necessary for the ordinary purposes of navigation; and it appears indispensable before a correct judgment can be formed of the confidence to which methods may be entitled, which have been already, or may hereafter be devised, to supersede these corrections by the employment of compensating forces. It is not necessary that steam or iron-built ships should perform voyages like those of the Erebus and Terror to procure this knowledge; a voyage from the British Channel to the Tropics would be sufficient; the ship should be swung before her departure from these islands, and immediately on her arrival in the Tropics, and at intervals of three or six months during her continuance there; the experiment should also be repeated on her return to England before any material alteration is made in the distribution of her iron.

**Index Correction.**

*Index Correction of R. F. 5 for the Observations of the Inclination in the Erebus.*

The observations at sea with this needle having been made in the one position of the instrument only, viz. with the face of the circle towards the east, and the marked side of the needle towards the observer,—we have to obtain the index correction, by comparing the inclinations observed in the same manner on shore, or on the ice, with the results given at the same places by needles of which the poles were reversed and the needle and circle used in the eight ordinary positions.

The stations which furnish this comparison are Hobarton, Sydney, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and two stations on the ice in the latitudes of $-63^\circ 23&#x27;$ and $-65^\circ 49&#x27;$. The results of the observations at Hobarton with needles with which the complete process for determining the inclination was gone through, were given in No. V. of these Contributions*. Those at the other five stations are as follows:

General Mean: \( -52^\circ 26&#x27;2&#x27;&#x27; \)
From these observations we have the true inclination at these six stations as follows:

- On ice, lat. $65^\circ 49&#x27;$. Long. $202^\circ 02&#x27;$ . . $79^\circ 39&#x27;5$
- On ice, lat. $63^\circ 23&#x27;$. Long. $210^\circ 02&#x27;$ . . $77^\circ 23&#x27;3$
- Hobarton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $70^\circ 40&#x27;7$
- Sydney . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $62^\circ 49&#x27;1$
- New Zealand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $59^\circ 31&#x27;9$
- Falkland Islands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $52^\circ 26&#x27;2$

The observations with R. F. 5, at the same stations, and at the same spots on shore, or on the ice, gave as follows:

| On Ice. | On Ice. |
|---------|---------|
| Lat. $-68^\circ 49&#x27;$. Long. $202^\circ 02&#x27;$. | Lat. $-63^\circ 23&#x27;$. Long. $210^\circ 02&#x27;$. |
| Hobarton. | Sydney. | New Zealand. | Falkland Islands. |
| Face East $-79^\circ 35&#x27;6$ | $-77^\circ 15&#x27;5$ | $-70^\circ 26&#x27;4$ | $-62^\circ 46&#x27;3$ | $-59^\circ 29&#x27;8$ | $-52^\circ 32&#x27;9$ |
| Face West $-80^\circ 39&#x27;2$ | $-78^\circ 20&#x27;3$ | $-71^\circ 20&#x27;3$ | $-63^\circ 44&#x27;3$ | $-60^\circ 27&#x27;9$ | $-53^\circ 34&#x27;7$ |
| Mean $-80^\circ 07&#x27;4$ | $-77^\circ 47&#x27;9$ | $-70^\circ 53&#x27;4$ | $-63^\circ 15&#x27;3$ | $-59^\circ 58&#x27;8$ | $-53^\circ 03&#x27;8$ |

We have thus the following index corrections:

| Face East | $-3&#x27;8$ | $-7&#x27;8$ | $-14&#x27;3$ | $-2&#x27;8$ | $-2&#x27;1$ | $+6&#x27;7$ |
| Face West | $+59&#x27;7$ | $+57&#x27;0$ | $+39&#x27;6$ | $+55&#x27;2$ | $+56&#x27;0$ | $+68&#x27;5$ |
| Mean correction | $+27&#x27;9$ | $+24&#x27;6$ | $+12&#x27;7$ | $+26&#x27;2$ | $+26&#x27;9$ | $+37&#x27;6$ |

and the difference of the results with the face east and face west as follows:

$63&#x27;6$ $64&#x27;8$ $53&#x27;9$ $58&#x27;0$ $58&#x27;1$ $61&#x27;8$

From the signs and numerical values of the corrections of the mean results with R. F. 5, we may infer that the axis of rotation in this needle deviated from the centre of gravity in the longitudinal direction, so as to cause the south end of the needle slightly to preponderate. From the differences of the results with the face east and face west, it appears that there was also a small deviation in the axis of rotation from the centre of gravity in the perpendicular direction. In the results with the face east, these two sources of error partially counteracted each other, so that the index correction with the face east amounted at no time to more than a very few minutes.

The corrections which have been applied to the observations have been taken from the following table, in which the correction for $-70^\circ$ has been taken as $-5&#x27;8$, and the change in the correction, corresponding to an increase of one degree in the south dip, as $-0&#x27;5$. In forming this table the determinations on land have been allowed a greater weight than the determinations upon the ice, the latter consisting of fewer observations, and being made probably under circumstances less favourable for this particular purpose.

**Index Correction of F. C. B. for the Observations of Inclination in the Terror.**—The observations of inclination at sea in this ship were all made with the face of the instrument towards the east, and with the marked face of the needle towards the observer. We may examine the index corrections consequently in the same manner, and by comparison with the same complete determinations as in the case of the needle of the Erebus; confining the comparison however to the land stations, because F. C. B. was not observed with at either of the ice stations.

The inclinations taken with this needle were observed both direct and with the aid of deflectors; the deflectors employed were a spare needle as &quot;deflector N&quot; and &quot;deflector S&quot;; and the magnets of the apparatus, either used separately as &quot;magnet N,&quot; or &quot;magnet S,&quot; or conjointly as &quot;magnets N S.&quot; From some instrumental accident, the inclinations observed with &quot;deflector N&quot; were always considerably in defect of the others when the face of the circle was east; with a corresponding excess with the face west, on the few occasions on shore when the observations were made in both positions. As the observations at sea were exclusively with the face east, it has been necessary on this account to consider separately those amongst them which were taken with &quot;deflector N,&quot; and to obtain a distinct index correction for them. We will first examine the index corrections required for the direct observations, and for those with the other deflectors.

The observations with F. C. B. on shore at the four land stations, where the com-
plete process for determining the true inclination was gone through with other needles, were as follows:

The corrections of the mean results with F. C. B. at the four stations accord well within the limits of observation error. On examining the differences in the results with the face east and face west, and the corrections severally required in the two positions at the four stations, it appears probable that a very slight derangement of some part of the instrument took place between the observations at Sydney and those at the Bay of Islands, which caused the partial results with the face east and face west to diverge more from each other than they had done previously, but without affecting the mean results. A note which accompanied the observations to England shows that Captain Crozier considered that some slight change had taken place in the amount of the index correction with the face east, but was unable to assign its date or its cause. In the absence of any distinct evidence in these respects,—and in consideration of the insufficiency of the means of assigning the precise amount of the change,—I have preferred the employment of an arithmetical mean of the index corrections observed at the four stations ($-35&#x27;$) during the whole course of the voyage. The uncertainty arising from this source cannot amount to more than a very few minutes in any portion of the voyage.

For the index correction with deflector N we have,

Elements of Calculation of the Intensity Observations.

1. With Weights.—The observations of the intensity of the magnetic force, during the period now under consideration, were made in both ships with Mr. Fox&#x27;s apparatus; those in the Erebus with the same circle which had been used in the previous voyage, and those in the Terror with a circle of the same size as that of the Erebus, being the property of Captain Crozier, and received by him at Van Diemen Island. The needle employed to show the angles of deflection in the Erebus, marked R. F. 5, was not the same which had been used for that purpose in the voyage of 1840–1841, namely, R. F. 4, which now in its turn was used as a deflector. The weights employed in deflecting the intensity needle were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 grains: the angles of deflection obtained with one grain were however too small to yield results of the same satisfactory nature as those derived from the weights from two to six grains, and I have not therefore taken them into the account. The mounted needle in the Terror was marked F. C. B., a spare needle C being used as a deflector, in addition to the deflecting magnets belonging to the apparatus. The weights were 1, 1½, 2, 2½, 3 and 3½ grains.

At Hobarton we have the deflections occasioned by the constant weights on the needle of the Erebus, April 1841, as follows:

| Deflection. Therm. | Deflection. Therm. |

| grs.              | grs.              |

and in the needle of the Terror as follows:

At Sydney, in July 1841, the deflections with the same weights were—

Taking 1·82 as the provisional value of the intensity at Hobarton (Phil. Trans. 1843, Part II. p. 186)*, we have its value at Sydney, by the needles of the two ships, as follows:

At the Bay of Islands in New Zealand, in August and October 1841, the deflections were as follows:

**Note:** The values given are in degrees, minutes, and seconds (°′″).
Besides the four land stations at which the intensities shown by the needles of the two ships have been thus compared, we have also one ice station in lat. $-65^\circ 47&#x27;$, long. $202^\circ 08&#x27;$, at which similar comparisons may be instituted. The deflections and intensities were as follows:

| Erebus | Terror |

| | | | $3\frac{1}{2}$ | $43^\circ 23&#x27;5$ | $53^\circ$ | $1&#x27;932$ |

Collecting these several results in one view, we have as follows:

| Erebus | Terror | Difference |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Intensity at Hobarton | $1&#x27;82$ | $1&#x27;82$ | (Erebus in defect.) |
| Intensity at Sydney | $1&#x27;685$ | $1&#x27;699$ | $&#x27;014$ or 8 parts in 1000 |
| Intensity at the Bay of Islands | $1&#x27;594$ | $1&#x27;607$ | $&#x27;013$ or 8 parts in 1000 |
| Intensity on ice, lat. $-65^\circ 49&#x27;$, long. $202^\circ 02&#x27;$ | $1&#x27;939$ | $1&#x27;950$ | $&#x27;011$ or 7 parts in 1000 |
| Intensity at Port Louis, Falkland Islands | $1&#x27;322$ | $1&#x27;336$ | $&#x27;014$ or 10 parts in 1000 |

The difference between the results given by the needles of the two ships, though small, is so consistently shown at all the stations during the voyage, that we cannot hesitate to attribute it to the occurrence of a change of corresponding amount in the magnetism of one needle or the other, between the observations at Hobarton in April 1841, and those at Sydney in July of the same year. If we further compare the intensities observed at sea by the two ships on the passage from Hobarton to Sydney, we find that a similar difference prevails in them; and we are therefore led to the conclusion, either that the needle of the Terror gained, or that the needle of the Erebus lost, a very small portion of magnetism, in the period between the observations at Hobarton in April 1841, and the departure of the Expedition from that port in the following July. Now experience has shown that a loss of magnetism is no unfrequent occurrence, whilst a gain is extremely rare, happening only, as far as we know, from such an accident as the contact of a needle with a more powerful magnet than itself. We may therefore conclude with great probability that the needle of the Erebus sustained a small loss of magnetism between April and July 1841, antecedent to all the observations of the voyage, causing the intensities derived with it, when computed in reference to the angles of deflection observed at Hobarton in April 1841, to require to be increased about one hundredth part, or more precisely 8 parts in 1000, in order
to bring them into strict relation with 1·82, taken as the value of the force at Hobarton. This correction being applied, all the intensities observed throughout the voyage by the two ships are in accordance (subject only to errors of observation), forming a consistent series of relative determinations, resting on 1·82 and 1·336, assumed provisionally as the values of the intensity at Hobarton and Port Louis, the commencing and concluding stations of the series. The correction is made in the Table which exhibits the intensities observed on board the two ships, and the geographical positions to which they belong; it is also made in the results inserted in the Map. The correctness of the values assumed at the base stations, 1·82 at Hobarton and 1·336 at Port Louis, remains to be proved by absolute determinations which have yet to be made at those two stations. The absolute intensities observed by the Expedition itself, with the instruments and according to the method prescribed in the instructions of the Royal Society, certainly have not the necessary precision. In the preceding Number of these Contributions are stated the results of five determinations which were obtained by Captain Ross at Hobarton in 1840 and 1841, with the 15-inch magnets of his observatory magnetometers; and of twenty-two determinations obtained by Lieut. Kay at the magnetic observatory at that station, with similar instruments, in 1841 and 1842. Captain Ross’s mean result was 4·573, the partial results varying from 4·491 to 4·626. Lieut. Kay’s mean result in 1841 was 4·553, the partial results (ten in number) varying from 4·509 to 4·601; and in 1842 4·513, the partial results (twelve in number) varying from 4·443 to 4·568. In 1843 Lieut. Kay received the auxiliary apparatus supplied in compliance with the revised instructions of the Royal Society, published in 1842. The magnets of this apparatus were 12 inches in length. The following Table exhibits the results obtained with this instrument in thirteen determinations made with it, between June 23rd and July 1st, 1843. Each determination is deduced from two series of observations of deflection; in the first six instances the distances were 4·505 and 6·005 feet; in the remainder, 4·0 and 5·3 feet. The moment of inertia of the deflecting magnet was computed from the length, breadth and mass of the bar.

Here also it is obvious, from the discrepancy of the partial results, that the angles of deflection afforded by these magnets at the prescribed distances, viz. the least distance being not less than four times the length of the bar, were still too small; and that before any final conclusion be arrived at, it is desirable that we should await the
results which will be obtained with the smaller apparatus described by Lieut. Riddell in his &quot;Magnetical Instructions for the use of Portable Instruments,&quot; &amp;c. In this apparatus the suspended and deflecting magnets are respectively 3·0 and 3·67 inches in length. Meanwhile we may derive, as a provisional value, the arithmetical mean of the four mean results already stated; allowing to each an equal weight, we have,

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Ross, in 1840–1841, 15-inch magnets, } &amp; 4\cdot573 \\
\text{Kay, in 1841, do. do. } &amp; 4\cdot553 \\
\text{Kay, in 1842, do. do. } &amp; 4\cdot513 \\
\text{Kay, in 1843, 12-inch magnets, } &amp; 4\cdot520
\end{align*}
\]

which, with the other necessary data stated in the preceding Number of these Contributions, would give the value of the total intensity at Hobarton 1·81 to 1·372 in London*.

* Since these pages were written I have received the details of the observations of ten distinct determinations of the absolute horizontal intensity at the magnetic observatory at Hobarton, made in August 1843 with deflecting and suspended magnets respectively of 9·18 inches and 7·50 inches in length. The deflecting distances were the same throughout, being 3·2893 and 4·3393 feet. The calculation of these observations not having been yet received from Lieut. Kay, the results have been computed by Lieut. Riddell, R.A., F.R.S., so far as the materials hitherto furnished permit. They give the value of \( X&#x27; \);—being the absolute horizontal intensity (X), uncorrected for the difference in the magnetic moment of the deflecting bar produced by the earth&#x27;s inducing action in the different positions in which the bar is placed in the experiments of deflection and in those of vibration; viz. 1° perpendicular to the magnetic meridian, and 2° in the plane of the meridian. We owe the suggestion of a correction due to this cause to Dr. Lamont: but the necessary data for computing it, for the particular bars employed by Lieut. Kay on this, or on the former occasions, have not yet been received. Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope and at Woolwich, with similar bars, have given results which show that the correction may possibly prove to be of nearly the same amount for the larger and smaller bars, in which case the relative values will be but little affected, and we may estimate that the value of X at Hobarton will be about 0·02 less than \( X&#x27; \). In the expression which has been employed in these Contributions for the absolute horizontal intensity (1·82 + e at Hobarton and 3·72 + e at London, e being a small quantity to be supplied hereafter), the correction here referred to will form a portion of e.

The mean value of the results, 4·501, is considerably different from the mean deduced in the text from all
At the Falkland Islands there were two determinations of the absolute horizontal intensity made by Captain Ross at the Magnetic Observatory at Port Louis, one in September 1842, being $6^\circ 8&#x27;$, and a second in November of the same year, being $6^\circ 32&#x27;$. They were both made with 15-inch magnets; the angles of deflection were observed at four distances, but amounted only to $56&#x27;8$, $31&#x27;9$, $21&#x27;4$, and $12&#x27;9$ in the first experiment, and to $1^\circ 49&#x27;9$, $1^\circ 01&#x27;6$, $41&#x27;5$, and $25&#x27;1$ in the second experiment.

These values of the horizontal intensity would give that of the total intensity at Port Louis respectively $1^\circ 609$ and $1^\circ 367$. It is obvious that we can draw no conclusion whatsoever from these numbers, and that we must wait for the confirmation or correction of the value given by the needles of Mr. Fox&#x27;s instrument, until absolute determinations can be procured with instruments capable of affording more satisfactory results. Steps have been taken to obtain such determinations at the Falkland Islands from Captain Sullivan, R.N., and at Sydney and New Zealand from the Surveying Expedition under Captain Blackwood, R.N.; when these arrive, we may learn whether any and what final correction will require to be applied to the intensities now provisionally deduced from the observations with Mr. Fox&#x27;s needles, in the Erebus and Terror. We may expect to receive these determinations before the time when the results now presented to the Royal Society will have to be combined with those of the preceding and succeeding years, in a general calculation of the magnetic lines in the southern hemisphere.

2. With Deflectors.—In the Erebus, the spare needle R.F. 4 was employed,—as &quot;deflector S,&quot; with its south pole opposite to the division of the circle which the south pole of the mounted needle had previously indicated as the dip;—and as &quot;deflector N,&quot; with its north pole similarly applied to the opposite division of the circle. The angles of deflection varied in different localities during the voyage, in round numbers as follows:—Deflect. S from $52^\circ$ to $71^\circ$; and deflect. N from $49^\circ$ to $67^\circ$. For obtaining the equivalent weights to the deflecting force of the deflectors at these angles, we have the comparative observations with deflectors and weights at Hobarton, Sydney, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and on the ice in lat. $-65^\circ 47&#x27;$, long. $202^\circ 08&#x27;$. The angles of deflection caused by the weights have been already stated; the preceding observations; yet from the improvement which it is natural to suppose practice must have made in the observers, and from the reduced discrepancies of the partial results with the smaller bars, the mean of the ten results in August 1843 would seem entitled to a preference over the earlier and more numerous results. Judging by what has been done at Woolwich with the 2&#x27;45 and 3 inch magnets, and at the Cape of Good Hope with 3&#x27;0 and 3&#x27;67 inch, we may expect with them a still further and considerable reduction in the discrepancies of the partial results; but it would not be safe, with the comparisons which we have now before us, to feel full confidence that there will be no apparently constant or systematic difference between the results of the larger and smaller bars. Reviewing the whole subject, we can as yet, therefore, only consider ourselves as being in progress towards such accuracy in determining the ratio of the intensity at different places by the absolute method, as shall be superior to that with which it was previously obtained by the employment of well-selected needles in relative determinations.
those by the deflectors, with the equivalent weights deduced from the comparison, are collected in the following Table.

| Station          | Date               | Intensity deduced by weights | Angles of deflection by | Equivalent weights |

By projecting these angles and weights, and proceeding in the manner described in the Third Number of these Contributions*, the values of $w&#x27;$ in the following Table were obtained for each deflector, corresponding to each angle of deflection $\nu&#x27;$; and employing these values of $w&#x27;$, the intensities $I&#x27;$ entered in the general table of observations have been computed by the formula

$$I&#x27; = \frac{1·82 \sin 56° 28&#x27;6&quot;}{7·39} \cdot w&#x27; \cosec \nu&#x27; = 2·053w&#x27; \cosec \nu&#x27;.$$

Besides the observations with the spare needle R. F. 4, employed as a deflector, angles of deflection were occasionally observed with the magnets N and S, belonging to the apparatus of the Erebus, used conjointly; their magnetism, however, was so much inferior to that of R. F. 4, that, even when both were used together, their joint effect was less than the half of either pole of R. F. 4; their results would consequently be much inferior in precision to those of R. F. 4, and I have not therefore employed them.

In the Terror, the spare needle marked C was employed both as &quot;deflector N&quot; and &quot;deflector S.&quot; The magnets belonging to the apparatus were also used, N separately, and N and S conjointly. Observations were also occasionally made with magnet S, but its magnetism was so feeble, and the deflections obtained with it consequently so small in comparison with the others, that the results are not entitled to the same confidence, and have not therefore been taken into the account. The equivalent weights have been obtained, as in the Erebus, from the comparative observations with weights and deflectors at Hobarton, Sydney, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands.

I have also, in the case of the Terror, availed myself of a comparison of the weights and deflectors made on the 3rd, 4th and 5th of December 1841, at sea, when the weather was extremely favourable, and the ship did not materially change her position. From the observations on these days we have as follows:

General Remarks.—If we take a general view of the magnetic declination in the southern hemisphere, particularly in the best-known portion of it, comprised between the tropics and the Antarctic Circle, we find that the phenomena present the same obvious and decided features of a duplicate system as do those of the northern hemisphere. If, following any of the geographical parallels, we carry our attention round the hemisphere, we find it divided into four spaces, in which opposite characteristics in regard to the direction of the needle alternately present themselves. In two of the spaces the change in the pointing of the needle, as the space is traversed in the direction of the parallel, is continuous and progressive towards the west, and in the other two continuous and progressive towards the east. If, for example, commencing with the meridian of $30^\circ$ E. or thereabouts, we trace the parallel of $-45^\circ$ round the hemisphere, always proceeding in an easterly direction till we return to the meridian at which we began, we shall find that we first pass through a space in which the direction of the north end of the needle becomes progressively more and more easterly, either by the decrease of westerly or increase of easterly declination; we next pass into a second space, on entering which the continuity is broken, the progressive movement of the north end of the needle towards the east is arrested, and its direction becomes now more and more westerly as we advance; thence we pass, successively, into a third space which has the same characteristic as the first, and into a fourth which has the same as the second.

The spaces here spoken of must be distinguished from those which are characterized by the exclusive prevalence of either east or west declination: they have a more simple and pure magnetical relation, implying the predominance within each space of one or the other of the two systems of magnetic forces which govern the direction of the needle. It may happen, or it may not happen, that in one of these spaces the direction of the needle may coincide in some point or points with the geographical meridian; when this occurs, the space will comprise both east and west declination; when it does not happen, the declination throughout the space will be exclusively east or exclusively west as the instance may be: but in either case, the change in the direction of the needle is always continuous and uniform in character throughout the space. It is well known that if the magnetic declination be computed on the supposition of a single central magnetic axis, there will be found two, and only two such spaces in each hemisphere. The systematic discordance which the declinations in the northern hemisphere presented when compared with the declinations so computed, and their agreement with the phenomena deducible from a double system of forces, led Halley to embrace the latter hypothesis. The declinations in the southern hemisphere present an arrangement strictly analogous to that in the northern, and conduct to the same conclusion, be that conclusion what it may.

If, with Halley, we view the declinations in the Southern Pacific as principally influenced by the weaker system of forces, or by that to which is also to be ascribed the high intensity of the magnetic force in the same quarter, we should be prepared
to expect that if the geographical limits of the adjacent spaces, having the characteristics referred to, were determined at different epochs, the alteration in the position of the spaces, if any, would show the existence of a secular change in the system itself; that it would indicate the direction of such change; and, if the intervals were sufficiently long in reference to the precision with which the determinations were made, the average rate of the movement of translation might also be inferred.

In this view a knowledge of the geographical position of the limiting lines, or of lines drawn so as to separate one of these spaces from the next, may have a particular value. In the part of the Pacific Ocean which is now referred to, the separating lines, as for distinction they may be called, coincide nearly in direction with geographical meridians, and are therefore crossed nearly at right angles by vessels pursuing a course from east to west, or from west to east. Prior to our own times, the epoch of Captain Cook&#x27;s voyages is perhaps that in which the observations of the declination in the Southern Pacific may be regarded with the most confidence. The determinations of that period have been collected by M. Hansteen into a map, of which he assigns the year 1770 as the mean epoch. It is one of those published in the Atlas of the Magnetismus der Erde, and comprehends the results obtained by Byron, Carteret, Wallis, Cook in three voyages, Ekeberg also in three voyages, and Abercrombie. If in this map we draw lines separating the spaces which have the opposite magnetic characteristics referred to, and compare them with the corresponding lines which we may draw in Erman&#x27;s map of the Declination in 1827–1830, published in the Magnetic Instructions of the Royal Society, we find an effect of secular change very distinctly shown in the altered position of the separating lines. These lines, A and B, are drawn in the accompanying Plate*, where the two epochs, 1770, and 1827–1830, are brought into comparison. In the map of 1827–1830, the separating lines occupy a considerably more westerly position than in the earlier map, the difference amounting to about $10^\circ$ of longitude. Hence we are led to the conclusion, that the spaces in the Southern Pacific, distinguished by certain magnetic characteristics, undergo a movement of translation, of which the general direction is from east to west. This direction is the opposite to that in which the change is known to take place in the corresponding quarter in the northern hemisphere (viz. in the Siberian quarter), where the secular movement is from west to east.

We are not without earlier, though possibly it may be supposed less precise, evidence of the effect of secular change in the Southern Pacific. From Halley&#x27;s chart of the variation lines for 1700, we are enabled to draw the separating line B for that epoch, when we find it to have been between the longitudes of $305^\circ$ and $310^\circ$. In a still earlier map drawn by Hansteen for the year 1600 (Magnetismus der Erde, Atlas, No.1), representing the observations of the very able and scientific navigators of that period, we find the position of the same line to have been about $333^\circ$ of east longitude.

In the observations of Captain Ross&#x27;s voyage, we have the most recent evidence of the progressive westerly movement of the magnetic phenomena in the Southern

* Plate XII.
Pacific. The separating lines A and B, deducible from the observations in 1842, are seen in the Plate to be in both cases considerably to the west of those derived from the observations of 1827–1830.

The whole body of evidence therefore, from the earliest observations to the latest, is consistent in showing a progressive movement to the westward of the spaces in the Southern Pacific, characterized by certain magnetic peculiarities, which in Halley&#x27;s view indicated the proximity and predominance of the weaker system of forces. It is worthy of notice that the rate of progression, deduced from the changes of position shown at the several epochs, differs much less from a uniform rate than might have been anticipated from the nature of the evidence we possess, even supposing the actual rate to have been uniform in nature; whilst the magnitude of the whole change which appears to have taken place since the phenomenon became the subject of observation, in round numbers 50° of longitude in two centuries and a half, can scarcely fail to fix the attention. These are facts which, when the true physical causes of the magnetism of the globe shall occupy the earnest attention of philosophers, will probably attain an importance which at present perhaps we scarcely sufficiently estimate. But an endeavour to place distinctly before our minds facts of which the explanation must be deemed an essential condition of a satisfactory solution of this great problem, may not be without its use even at the present time. It may be also useful to call the attention of navigators to the value which may hereafter attach to determinations which may be made with instruments which are on board every ship, and in constant employ for the ordinary purposes of navigation. The position of the lines separating the spaces which have been the subject of discussion, has the advantage of being even more easily determined by observations on board ship than that of any particular declination line; in crossing them, the declination, if previously decreasing, will then begin to increase, and if previously increasing will begin to decrease; the determination is therefore independent of compass error, which is a much more prevalent source of error than is generally supposed; and if the ship&#x27;s course be steady for some days together, which in the latitudes in question is very frequently the case, it is also in a great measure independent of the disturbance occasioned by the ship&#x27;s iron. A very cursory inspection of the general table of the declinations observed by the Erebus and Terror suffices to show that they must have crossed the separating line (A) about the 15th of March 1842, when their latitude was about −59° and longitude 221°; and the line (B) about the 27th or 28th of the same month in latitude about −59°, and longitude 275°*.

Should the circumstance occur that one of the separating lines in the course of its progressive change of place should pass over a magnetic observatory, the epoch of its passage would be precisely determined. There is some reason for believing that

* The line A passes through the culminating points of the southerly inflexion of the declination lines, of which the present position is shown in the Declination Map at the close of this paper to be about 220° east longitude. The line B passes through the culminating points of the northerly inflexion of the declination lines about the longitude of 276°.
such an event is now taking place at the Cape of Good Hope. If we examine Erman&#x27;s map of the Declination in 1827–1830, published in the magnetic instructions of the Royal Society, we find one of the separating lines in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope, and if we compare this map with those of earlier epochs, we find the position of that line progressively more and more to the east as we ascend in the order of time. Hence we should be led to expect that about this period it might be found to pass over the meridian of the Cape. The observations which have been made daily at the magnetic observatory at the Cape, since its establishment in 1841, give reason to believe that the westerly declination which had been increasing for above two centuries, attained its maximum in the year 1842 or 1843. In April 1841 the declination was $29^\circ 05&#x27;$ west, in April 1844 $29^\circ 06&#x27;$ west*. The earliest observations at the Cape with which I am acquainted, are those of Davis in 1605, and Keeling in 1609. (Purchas, Book iv. ch. 6. § 1. and Book iii. ch. 6. § 4.) According to these observations the declination in 1605 was $0^\circ 30&#x27;$ east, and in 1609 $0^\circ 12&#x27;$ west†. The line of no declination probably therefore passed over the Cape about the year 1607, and in 235 years the westerly declination has increased from $0^\circ$ to $29^\circ$, (omitting the odd minutes,) or at an annual average rate of $7&#x27;$. Observations at several intermediate epochs show that the progression of this change was at least not very far from being an uniform one. If we divide the whole period into four equal parts, we should have

| Year     | Declination |
|----------|-------------|
| 1607     | $0^\circ$   |
| 1666     | $7^\circ 15&#x27;$ W. |
| 1725     | $14^\circ 30&#x27;$ W. |
| 1784     | $21^\circ 45&#x27;$ W. |
| 1843     | $29^\circ$ W. |

In the appendix of Hansteen&#x27;s Magnetismus der Erde, p. 24, we have the record of actual observations as follows:

| Year     | Declination |
|----------|-------------|
| 1667     | $7^\circ 15&#x27;$ W. |
| 1724     | $16^\circ 27&#x27;$ W. |
|          | $16^\circ 18&#x27;$ W. |
| 1780     | $22^\circ 16&#x27;$ W. |

We may therefore conclude that the westerly declination at the Cape, which for above 200 years had increased at an average rate of about $7&#x27;$.4 a year, or a degree in about eight years, has been for the last three years nearly stationary, having arrived at a maximum of $29^\circ$ and a few minutes about the year 1843; and that a decreasing progression may now be expected‡. Ships passing the Cape, on a voyage to the

* The observations at the magnetic observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, preparing for the press, will show the mean declination in each month of the years referred to.

‡ Captain FitzRoy observed $28^\circ 30&#x27;$ in 1836; at that epoch, consequently, the maximum had not been reached. Sir Edward Belcher, in 1842, observed $29^\circ 13&#x27;$.
east, will find that the westerly variation, which increases the whole way from the Brazils to about the meridian of the Cape, begins there to diminish, and continues to diminish, passing into easterly variation increasing, for above 100 degrees of longitude east of the Cape. The separating line which now passes through the Cape divides spaces distinguished by opposite magnetic characteristics; on the west side of the Cape the north end of the needle moves to the west, and on the east side to the east, as east longitude increases.

The maps which exhibit the results of the observations in the two ships, of the Declination, Inclination and Intensity, in the voyage of 1841–1842, and the isogonic, isoclinal, and isodynamic lines traced approximately in conformity with them, are a continuation of the maps published in No. V., which embodied in a similar manner the results of the preceding voyage. The results in the Erebus are distinguished from those in the Terror by a different character, for the purpose of permitting the degree of accordance in the two series of independent determinations to be readily judged of by the eye. These maps afford the best reply to those who have expressed doubts of the success of observations of the inclination and intensity made at sea.

Magnetic lines, drawn from observations made in parts of the globe to which observation had not previously extended, are the proper test by which we may judge of the degree of approximation with which the values of the numerical elements have been obtained in a general mathematical theory of terrestrial magnetism, such as M. Gauss&#x27;s. The portion of the observations of the Antarctic Expedition which has been placed before the Royal Society in No. V. and in the present number of these Contributions, permits us already to form some conclusion on this point. Plate XIII. exhibits the lines of one of the magnetic elements, i.e. the intensity, computed by M. Gauss&#x27;s theory, and drawn in Plates XVIII. and XIX. of the Atlas des Erdmagnetismus, compared with the lines which are the direct results of observation.

The very imperfect resemblance between the two systems of lines is of course no impeachment of the sufficiency of the theory, with corrected numerical elements, to represent the natural phenomena in parts of the globe which observation may not have reached. The degree of approximation to which it will do this must depend upon the extent and correctness of the observation-basis from whence the numerical elements are derived, and upon the order of the magnitudes comprehended in the calculation.

The evidence which the plate affords, that the calculations in the elaborate work referred to differ so widely from the facts in the southern latitudes, shows how much observations were wanting in those latitudes for the purpose of perfecting the theory; and is an ample justification (if indeed any justification were necessary) of the exertions which the last few years have witnessed to obtain them.

Since these pages were written I have received from Mr. Archibald Smith the following note. Regarding it as a continuation of the memorandum with which he
was so obliging as to favour me, printed in the last number of these Contributions, I avail myself of this opportunity of giving it an early circulation.

&quot;The apparent changes in the values of the constants $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, in the Erebus and Terror (Contributions, No. V., p. 153), seem to show that those vessels had an appreciable quantity of magnetism, which was so far permanent, as to retain for a considerable time traces of the inductive force to which they had been exposed, and perhaps some strictly permanent magnetism. It seems, therefore, desirable to introduce into the expressions in the memorandum printed at p. 147 of Contribution No. V., terms which will represent such forces.

&quot;Suppose, then, as in the memorandum, that $\phi$ represents the total magnetic force of the earth at the place of observation, $\theta$ the inclination, $\zeta$ the azimuth of the ship&#x27;s head, reckoning from N. to W., and that $\phi&#x27;$, $\theta&#x27;$, $\zeta&#x27;$ represent the values of the same quantities shown by an instrument at a fixed position in the vessel, and affected by the attraction of the iron in the vessel; and let $P$, $Q$, $R$ represent the attraction of the permanent magnetism in the vessel to the bow, to the starboard side, and vertically downwards. The fundamental equations of the former memorandum become by the introduction of these terms,

$$\phi&#x27; \cos \theta&#x27; \cos \zeta&#x27; = \phi [A&#x27; \cos \theta \cos \zeta + B \cos \theta \sin \zeta + C \sin \theta] + P$$

$$\phi&#x27; \cos \theta&#x27; \sin \zeta&#x27; = \phi [D \cos \theta \cos \zeta + E&#x27; \cos \theta \sin \zeta + F \sin \theta] + Q$$

$$\phi&#x27; \sin \theta&#x27; = \phi [G \cos \theta \cos \zeta + H \cos \theta \sin \zeta + K&#x27; \sin \theta] + R.$$

&quot;In these equations $A&#x27;$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E&#x27;$, $F$, $G$, $H$ and $K&#x27;$ are constants depending on the distribution of the soft iron in the ship, and perhaps on the temperature and other circumstances.

&quot;If we suppose, as before, that the soft iron is symmetrically disposed, the equations (1.) (2.) and (3.) of the former memorandum become,

$$\frac{\phi&#x27;}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} \cos \zeta = \cos \zeta + a \tan \theta + \frac{P}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} . . . . . . . . . (1.)$$

$$\frac{\phi&#x27;}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} \sin \zeta = b \sin \zeta + \frac{Q}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} . . . . . . . . . (2.)$$

$$\frac{\phi&#x27;}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} \sin \theta = c \cos \zeta + d \tan \theta + \frac{R}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} . . . . . . . . . (3.)$$

&quot;Let $H$ represent the horizontal force $= \phi \cos \theta$, $H&#x27;$ the affected horizontal force $= \phi&#x27; \cos \theta&#x27;$, and let $a \tan \theta + \frac{P}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} = L$, $\frac{Q}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} = M$, and $d \tan \theta + \frac{R}{A&#x27; \cos \theta} = N$. The last equations become

$$\frac{H&#x27;}{A&#x27; \cos \zeta} = \cos \zeta + L . . . . . . . (1 a.)$$

$$\frac{H&#x27;}{A&#x27; \cos \zeta} = b \sin \zeta + M . . . . . . . (2 a.)$$

$$\frac{H&#x27;}{A&#x27; \cos \zeta} = c \cos \zeta + N . . . . . . . (3 a.)$$
&quot;By the introduction of the same quantities, the equations numbered from (4.) to (14.) in the former memorandum become

\[
\frac{H&#x27;}{A&#x27;H} = \cos \zeta \cos \zeta&#x27; + b \sin \zeta \sin \zeta&#x27; + L \cos \zeta&#x27; + M \sin \zeta&#x27;
\]

(4.)

\[
(\cos \zeta + L) \sin \zeta&#x27; = (b \sin \zeta + M) \cos \zeta&#x27;;
\]

(5.)

and representing \( \zeta - \zeta&#x27; \), or the deviation, by \( \delta \),

\[
\sin \delta = L \sin \zeta&#x27; - M \cos \zeta&#x27; + (1 - b) \sin \zeta \cos \zeta&#x27;.
\]

(6.)

\[
= \frac{2}{1+b} L \sin \zeta&#x27; - \frac{2}{1+b} M \cos \zeta&#x27; + \frac{1-b}{1+b} \sin (\zeta + \zeta&#x27;).
\]

(7.)

\[
\tan \zeta&#x27; = \frac{b \sin \zeta + M}{\cos \zeta + L}.
\]

(8.)

\[
c \cos \zeta + N = (b \sin \zeta + M) \cosec \zeta&#x27; \tan \theta&#x27;.
\]

(9.)

\[
= (\cos \zeta + L) \sec \zeta&#x27; \tan \theta&#x27;.
\]

(10.)

\[
= \sqrt{(\cos \zeta + L)^2 + (b \sin \zeta + M)^2}. \tan \theta&#x27;.
\]

(11.)

\[
\tan \theta&#x27; = \frac{c}{b} \cdot \frac{\cos \zeta + \frac{1}{c} N}{\sin \zeta + \frac{1}{b} M} \sin \zeta&#x27;.
\]

(12.)

\[
= c \frac{\cos \zeta + \frac{1}{c} N}{\cos \zeta + L} \cdot \cos \zeta&#x27;.
\]

(13.)

\[
= \frac{c \cos \zeta + N}{\sqrt{(\cos \zeta + L)^2 + (b \sin \zeta + M)^2}}.
\]

(14.)

&quot;Equation (7.) may also be put under the form

\[
\sin \delta = \frac{2}{1+b} \sqrt{L^2 + M^2 \sin (\zeta&#x27; - \mu) + \frac{1-b}{1+b} \sin (\zeta + \zeta&#x27;)},
\]

where

\[
= \frac{2}{1+b} L \sec \mu \sin (\zeta&#x27; - \mu) + \frac{1-b}{1+b} \sin (\zeta + \zeta&#x27;),
\]

in which \( \tan \mu = \frac{M}{L} \), and \( \mu \) represents the displacement of the line of no deviation towards the starboard side.

&quot;By means of these equations we can determine \( A&#x27;, L, b, M, c, N \), from observations made at sea alone. The first four of these quantities furnish the corrections for the horizontal force and the declination. There is greater difficulty in obtaining the correction for the inclination. It will be observed that \( \theta \) only occurs in these equations involved in the quantities \( L \) and \( N \). If there were no permanent magnetism in the vessel, it would be necessary, in order to determine the correcting factors \( a \) and \( d \), that observations of the inclination on shore, and corresponding observations on board, should be made in at least one magnetic latitude. If there is any appreciable permanent magnetism, observations of the inclination on shore and on board, and of the horizontal force, should be made in at least two magnetic latitudes. This would be sufficient if \( a, P, d, R \) remained absolutely constant. As that appears not to be
the case, as many observations as possible should be made of the inclination on shore and on board, with corresponding observations of the horizontal force. Such observations should be made with great care when the vessel is on or near the magnetic equator and before and after any rapid change of magnetic latitude, and whenever the vessel returns to a place where the observations have been made before on board the same vessel, under the same circumstances as to the distribution of her iron.

&quot;When the permanent magnetism is symmetrically distributed, $Q = 0$ and $M = 0$, and the other constants may be easily, and probably with great accuracy, determined from the following equations. The small letter suffixed to the symbol of a function indicating the affected value observed with the vessel&#x27;s head on the N., W., S., E. (affected) points,

$$A&#x27; = \frac{H_n + H_s}{2H} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (15.)$$

$$a \tan \theta + \frac{P}{A&#x27;H} = L = \frac{H_n - H_s}{H_n + H_s} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (16.)$$

$$b = \frac{H_w + H_e}{2\sqrt{H_n H_s}} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (17.)$$

$$d \tan \theta + \frac{R}{A&#x27;H} = N = \frac{H_n \tan \theta_n + H_s \tan \theta_s}{H_n + H_s} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (18.)$$

$$c = \frac{H_n \tan \theta_n - H_s \tan \theta_s}{H_n + H_s} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (19.)$$

&quot;The values of $H_n, H_s, H_e, H_w$, are given by the square of the number of vibrations of a horizontal needle made in a given time, and beginning to vibrate in a given arc, and require no correction except for temperature.

&quot;If $n, s$, represent the number of vibrations made by such a needle in the same time, with the ship&#x27;s head successively on the north and south points, and if $\Delta$ represent the value of $\delta$ when $\zeta&#x27; = \pm 90$, the values of $L$ and $\Delta$ are given by the following simple expressions:

&quot;If $\tan \lambda = \frac{n}{s}$,

$$L = \cos 2\lambda. \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (20.)$$

$$\Delta = 90^\circ - 2\lambda. \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (21.)$$

The equations (18.) and (19.) may be put under the form

$$d \tan \theta + \frac{R}{A&#x27;H} = N = \frac{\varphi_n \sin \theta_n + \varphi_s \sin \theta_s}{\varphi_n \cos \theta_n + \varphi_s \cos \theta_s} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (22.)$$

$$c = \frac{\varphi_n \sin \theta_n - \varphi_s \sin \theta_s}{\varphi_n \cos \theta_n + \varphi_s \cos \theta_s} \quad \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \quad (23.)$$

and the values of $N$ and $c$ obtained, but probably with less accuracy, from observations of the total intensity and inclinations made with a Fox&#x27;s instrument.

&quot;Note.—The last equation in the former memorandum is erroneous. The value of $\psi&#x27;$ cannot be obtained from two observations of the true azimuth of the ship&#x27;s head, when $\zeta&#x27;_1 + \zeta&#x27;_2 = 180$, independently of $a$.&quot;

* This observation differs so widely from the others made on the same day, that, considering the unfavourable state of the weather, I have omitted it in the mean results: possibly the ship&#x27;s head may have been W. by S. instead of S. by W., in which case the observation would agree well with the others.—E.
