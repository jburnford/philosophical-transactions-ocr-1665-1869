<div class="ocr-text">So far the first communication concerning this matter: In which occurring several particulars, requiring further Information, and they being sent to the Author, he was pleased to return what follows.

&#x27;Tis so far, that the Rape is put into any place to sour before it be cast into the Vinegar-vessels, that as soon as &#x27;tis separated from its Grapes (which is done immediately after Vintage,) it is carefully put up in Barrels, least it take Air; without which it would heat itself, and be spoyled.

There is no other way of keeping the Rape that hath once served already, than to drown it; that is to say, to fill the Vessel wherein it is, with Wine or Vinegar. Rape will serve a year, more or less, provided that care be taken of cleaning every morning, with a piece of Linnen, the grease that is on the sides of the Vessel, and with a little broom, that which swims on the top of the liquor. The Rape may be freed from its grease with water, rubbing it between ones hands.

No body, that I know, hath hitherto examin&#x27;d what this Grease is. When I can get a fit quantity of it, I will endeavour to make some Experiments about it; especially if I be assisted with Suggestions for making proper ones.

I have been lately inform&#x27;d, that there have been Merchants here, who made Vinegar with phlegme of Wine, remaining after that the Aqua vita is extracted from it.</div>
