VI. An Extract of a Letter from Mr Ralph Thoresby, F.R.S. to Dr Nehemiah Grew, Fellow of the College of Physicians and R.S. concerning a Ball voided by Stool.

A Poor Apprentice Girl at Rawden, 4 miles from Leeds in Yorkshire, about 14 years of Age, having been tormented with Colical, and, as was suppos&#x27;d, Nephritick Pains for some time; at length voided a roundish Ball, per Anum, as hard to feel upon as a Stone.

After a while, the Pains returning with greater violence, so as to make her roll upon the ground, she voided another as hard, and much bigger.

Upon which, one Mrs Ward a neighbouring Gentlewoman, who had been much afflicted with Gravel, gave
her some of those Medicins which she us&#x27;d to take her self. Whereupon the Girl voided a third Ball, also per Anum, with less pain, yet the greatest of the three.

The first of these Balls is smooth and glossy, of the colour of a right Hazel nut, 3 inches about, and somewhat compressed. The other two rough and gritty, and in like manner a little compressed into a kind of obtusely triangular figure. The 2d, is 4 inches and a half round about; the last, 5 inches and a half.

Considering their bulk, all 3 are very light, especially the 2 latter and greater ones, of which the last weighs but 5 Drams 36 Grains; and both of them swim in water.

This lightness proceeds from the Matter whereof they consist; which, in some places is purely Downey or Fuzzy; in others, mixed with a Gritty substance, yet not confusedly, but regularly mixed. The Fuzzy parts possess the central part of the Ball, with a small particle of blackish Glass or other Vitrify&#x27;d substance in the very Centre itself. Over which are several Coats, gritty and fuzzy, alternately ending in the circumference with a grit, much resembling the Ground-work and Superstructure of the Oriental Bezoar-stone.

The Powder of one of these Balls scraped off with a Knife, is no way mov&#x27;d or affected with any sort either of Alcaline or Acid Liquor dropp&#x27;d thereupon. Neither being burn&#x27;d doth it stink, it consisteth therefore of no Animal substance; but the Girl being of the Green-sickness age, the gritty parts (with the glassy particle in the Centre, as the most ponderous and least moveable) seems to be broken off of Tobacco-Pipes, and ground small between her Teeth; the downy or fuzzy to be lick&#x27;d or scraped off the Lean of Mutton, or the Rind of Peaches, or some other Part or Plant. Her Stomach kneading the Matter into a Coat, as her changeable Appetite supply&#x27;d it alternately with one or the other sort.</div>
