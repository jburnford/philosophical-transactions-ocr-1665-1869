Angelinus and Alfarinos &amp; Cruce place them prope naso colatoria in strictura narium; both seeming to imply that Sinus more exactly describ&#x27;d by (2) Avicenna: Which is to be understood of humane Heads, not those of Brutes, but only as apply&#x27;d by Jouberius.

What terrible Symptoms, as Cephalaea&#x27;s, Deliriums, Epilepsies, Syncopes, Convulsions, &amp;c. a Worm, with such sharp and piercing Weapons may raise, by continually preying and sporting on a Part so exquisitely sensible, and nearly situate to the Origin of Sensation, as the Membrane, that invests the cavity of this Sinus, may be more easily imagin&#x27;d than explain&#x27;d.

V. An Account of very large Stones voided per Urethram. In a Letter from Mr Edw. Lhwyd, Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, to Dr Hans Sloane, S.R.S.

Oxford, Sept. 22, 1704.

I make bold to trouble you with a Copy of a Paper I receiv&#x27;d from Dr Bullen, a Physician in Cheshire, together with a figure of the Stones he mentions. They are much of the same size and shape; and being joyn&#x27;d together, the circumference one way is above three inches and a half, and the other three and a quarter, (See Fig. 10.) The person that voided them, took an excessive quantity of Honey during his pain; to which alone he attributes his Deliverance; how probably you can best judge.
Ne forte ea, quae verissima efficiant, pro verisimilibus tantum habeantur, vel de re in his Finibus tam notâ &amp; apertâ, ulterius ambigent Extranei, si quid ipse in suadendo Vallem, postulatus affero, testorq; —— in agro Cetriensi, loco non longè a vico Malbano dislito, quendam Thomam Olton annum jam septuagesimum octavum, &amp; quod excurrat, agentem, hominem sane probum, &amp; tám re quam famâ spectabiliem, per multos, retrò annos vixisse: qui quidem Vit cum vesicâ calculo graviter cruciatus est; opem a me aliquid Medicis circumdegentibus non semel petiit: eratq; a nobis variis medicamentis pro rei exigentia, sed inutiliter tractatus. Tandem verò in ano paroxysmorum, pra omnibus aliis atrocissimo, calculos duos, benedicente Numine, per Urinæ ductum excrevit; æneis istis ab ornatisissimo Viro R. W. Armigero Musæo Oxonieni nuper immisso, quoad figuram exactè quadrantisbus; &amp; archetypis, quæ supra drachmas duas seperatim pendebant, per omnia (gravitate excepta) respondentibus.

Calculum primò egestum dolor ferè intolerabilis comitavit, secundum verò vix ullus, qui molestiæ sensum crearet; nec mirum, si Urethra a lapide priùs emanante adeo disrupta, &amp; lacerata, alteri jam transituro facilem &amp; patentem præberet exitum. Duo autem hi calculi, unum aliquando in vesicâ constituebant; quòd ex fracturae, si committantur, convenientiâ, palam est. Ista via, ex neglectâ Chirurgia jam usq; patet; cui quidem incommodo Cornu peramplo, radici penis aptato, quoties Urinam mittit consulere coactus est; ne secùs tam sua, quam adstantium vestimenta inter mingeendum, inquinaret.

Hæcce quæ dico, non tantum mihi, sed toti Perichoro constant, adeò ut penè quemlibet effet me falsitatis arguere, si quid a veritate alienum pronunciare fusciperem. Sed (Diis gratias) si me rudem Natura, non vanum &amp; mendacem improba finxit; de prædictis itaq; fidem præstare non gravabor.

VI. An Experiment made at a Meeting of the R. Society, Decemb. 29. 1704. Of firing Gun-powder on a red hot Iron in Vacuo Boyliano. By Mr Fr. Hauksbee.

The Candent Iron being included in a Recipient proper for that purpose, and the Air withdrawn (which was in about two minutes of time) the Mercury then in the Gage standing at 29 inches, a quantity of Gunpowder was made immediately to descend upon the red hot Iron, which continu&#x27;d upon the surface of it some small time before it went off, and then was observ&#x27;d not to fire all at once; and the last of the Quantity that did so, seem&#x27;d to give the greatest flash: Upon which, the Mercurial gage was taken notice of to descend something more than an Inch, it rising again \( \frac{3}{8} \) of the same. And upon several Repetitions of the like quantity of Powder (the factitious Air being always first withdrawn) the Appearances were very resembling. Again, upon Purging the Recipient of the factitious Air, and the Mercury elevated in the Gage as at first, three quantities were caus&#x27;d to descend upon the Iron, whose Explosion, as well as the Air produc&#x27;d from them, seem&#x27;d in proportion to the quantity of Powder: The Mercury then in the Gage subsiding to 25. But upon dropping 6 Quantities (the Recipient being first purg&#x27;d as before) which Quantities not descending all at once, but successively as fast as might be, the Quan-</div>
