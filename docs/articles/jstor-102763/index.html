<div class="ocr-text">III. An Account of part of a Collection of Curious Plants and Drugs, lately given to the Royal Society by the East India Company.

A Preface to the following Account by the Publisher of these Transactions.

At the beginning of the 20th Volume of these Papers, an Account was promised of a Curious Collection of Plants and other Simples, gathered by Mr Samuel Brown, a Physician at Fort St George in the East Indies. The performance of which promise has been hitherto delayed, because some of the Seeds were distributed and raised in the most Curious Gardens in England, as at her Grace the Dutchess of Beaufort&#x27;s at Badminton, the Right Reverend the Bishop of London&#x27;s at Fulham, at Dr Robert Vuedale&#x27;s at Enfield, Mr Jacob Bobart&#x27;s in Oxford, Mr Du-Bois&#x27;s at Mitcham, and Mr Sam. Doody&#x27;s at the Apothecaries Garden in Chelsea. Some additional informations have been by this means received, and &#x27;twas hoped more might have been had; and this has been the occasion of the delay of this account.

It shall contain the whole and entire Observations of Mr Brown, without any abridgment. His Observations shall have his name subscribed to them, to distinguish them from the Remarks, designed to be added by Mr Petiver, which will give his Thoughts and Discoveries concerning these Plants, he having observed &#x27;em in other Collections, raised in England from Seeds, or described in Books already printed. He was thought the fittest person, as well for his great abilities in this kind, as that they were gathered at his desire, and that Mr Brown, who pre-
sented them to the Company, refers in some of these Books to some of the same kinds he had sent him before, as will appear hereafter.

The Order in which they are designed to be published is such as they came over in: The first Book will be in this Transaction, the others in those succeeding, as they can be got ready at Gresham College, and for the Press.

The Plants themselves, and the Original Papers of Mr Brown are kept in the same Order, and with the same Numbers in the Repository of the Society as they are here published, for the inspection of the Curious, who are desired to handle them tenderly, lest they should be injured; and the good intentions of the East India Company and Royal Society be frustrated, which are, that they may last for the Information and Use of all inquisitive Persons, and be forthcoming on all occasions wherein they can be of Service.

That they may be of great Use to the publick, is manifest from this one particular. Some years ago, I think, ever since the year 1672, a Root was made great Use of with some Success in Epileptic, Convulsive or Head Diseases; &#x27;twas call&#x27;d by Dr Peachy, a Physician since dead, Cassumunar, and a sheet of Paper was then printed of its Vertues. It seem&#x27;d to be a kind of Zedoary better than ordinary; but whence it came, or how to come by it, (the name being feign&#x27;d to hide it,) and the person dead, none cou&#x27;d tell. When I saw this Collection at the East-India-house, I found amongst other things this Root by the name of Bengalle, and an account that it was much used by the Natives in the Indies. I told some Drugsters of this discovery, they sent for it, and have receiv&#x27;d it from the Indies by that name, and now it is better understood, as will appear by these papers, and to be had in greater plenty, so that even the poorer fort of People may receive benefit by it at a more moderate price, and the
the Merchant receive advantage by trading in a new Commodity.

This is one of many Discoveries which are already made by this Collection, which I hope will sufficiently excuse me to those worthy persons I mov&#x27;d to sollicit in this affair that Honourable Company; who, upon understanding the matter, and the importance of it, very readily granted their request.

Mr Sam. Brown

His First Book of East India Plants, with their Names, Vertues, Description, &amp;c. And some additional Remarks, by James Petiver, Apothecary, and Fellow of the Royal Society.

These Plants were gathered from February the 26th to the 28th, at Hinguer Pollum, about 20 miles from Fort St George.

Plain Clay ground, somewhat Stony, not fit for Tillage, a meer Wilderness.

1 Cherry-Mango.

Mango Sylvestris Madraspat. fructu Cerasi. Musæi Petiveriani No. 659. Morittan-chidde Malab.

Of this there is another sort little differing, only that the Leaves are a little longer and sharper, which the Malabars call Cautman-chidde.

This is a small Tree about 6 or 8 foot high. I have not seen the Fruit, the Flowers have a very pleasant smell, the Leaves taste almost like Tea. I can learn nothing of its Vertue as yet. Mr Sam. Brown.

2. Madras Flower-Fence, with membranaceous pods.

Crista Pavonis auriculata, non spinosa, siliquis membranaceis e Madraspatan. Mus. Petiver. 635. Avaree Malab.

This Shrub is about 2, 3, and sometimes 4 foot high, and bears a flat pod about a finger long, and more than an inch broad. S. B.
It purges both in Infusion and Powder, and is given by the Natives in the Pox and lingering Fevers. Mr Sam Brown.

Dr Plukenet hath given a lame Figure of this in his Phytogr. Tab. 314. Fig. 4. and hath very little reason to suppose this Oriental Shrub, to be the Tepehoaxin of Roechus pag. 410, which bears red Flowers and two Seeds only, whereas the Flower of this is yellow, and the Seed seldom or never fewer than six.

3. Veludee Malab.

Siligosus Madraspat. frutex Glycrrhizae foliis alternis

This is a Shurb with slender Branches about 4 or 5 foot high.

It is very good to expel Worms of all sorts, and to ease pains proceeding from them. The Juice is very bitter; they chuse therefore to eat a handful of Leaves boil&#x27;d. S. B.

4. Neer-corea Malab.

It grows in wet places, Padde Fields, &amp;c. It is about a foot high. I know no Physical use of it. S. B.

5. Yelanaiureve Malab.

This is a small Shrub about one or two foot high.

It strongly provokes Urine, if the Decoction of the roasted Herb be taken with a little Powder of Borax.

Of this there is another larger sort. S. B.

This seems to differ very little or nothing from our common Melilot, and if it be the Suendadi pullu Hort. Vol. 9. Tab. 40. p. 75, the Figure of the Leaves are not well exprest, they being too broad and not crenated. Dr Plukenet&#x27;s Icon in his Phytograph Tab. 45. Fig. 5. is not much better, his being also whole and set altogether from one base, whereas the extrem Leaf should stand at some distance from the Pair. It rather agrees with his 4th Figure in the same Table, which also comes from these parts, and perhaps may be both one Plant.
6. *Laurus Madraspatana Canella alba foliis Pungalu Mal.*

This is a small Tree about 8 or 10 foot high: the Fruit of this boil&#x27;d and beat to a pulp, applied to scal&#x27;d Heads cures them, as also the Itch; but the Oyl of the Fruit by expression is much better, and may be also taken inwardly. S. B.

7. *Chrysanthemum Orientale foliis crispis Mus. Petiver 373 Conyza minor Indiae Orientalis, Nelapu Malaborum Mant. Alm. Bot. 55.* It may also be the *Chrysanthemum Benghalense angustifolium pusillum summo caule ramosum* of the same Author in his *Phytogr. Tab. 21. Fig. 4.* the Figure being taken from a poor specimen, as many of his others are.

It grows a foot or two high, has an Herby or Grass-like taste: the Natives mix with this 8 or 10 other Ingredients, and give it in Fevers. S. B.

8. *Muladundee Malab.*

*Capparis spinosa duplicatis spinis fol. acuto Mus. Petiver. 625.*

Dr Plukenet hath given a very imperfect Icon of this in his 107th Table Fig. 3. under the improper Epithet of *Rhamnus.* It may also be his *Ramus fortis Arbuscula Evonymifolio spinis gemellis Madraspatana Tab. 218. Fig. 7.* being very like it, and coming from the same place.

There are three sorts of this Tree, of all which they boil the Bark of the Root in either Coco or Gingee Oyl to cure Scabs and Itch, but take it not inwardly as I can learn: This is a trayling prickly Plant, rises about 14 or 15 foot high, and is supported by Trees, &amp;c. I take it for a species of Capers. S. B.

9. Aromatick Eye-bright from *Madraspatan Marre-pondu Malab.* This when fresh, has a weak but pretty aromatick smell, it bears a white Flower, which when dry looks blewish. S. B.
This is described in the *Philosoph. Transact.* No. 244, p. 328, fig. 31. Dr Plukenet hath given such a sort of an *Icon* of this *Herb* in his 177th Table, Fig. 6, that when he came to see it in his Collection, he was so far from knowing it again, that he makes a new Plant of it, adding Mr Brown&#x27;s Epithet of *Aromatick* to it, but supposes it to be another he had before figured under No. 3. Tab. 118. and if so, here is one Plant made three. I wonder so great a Botanist as Dr Plukenet should not know his own *Plants*, especially such he had taken the pains to *Figure*.

10. *Niconee Malab.*

This is a small *Tree*, 7 or 8 foot high, and sometimes as thick as a man&#x27;s Leg. The *Natives* use it instead of *Candles* and *Torches*: one time when I Travelled up the Country in the night they were my lights. S. B.

The specimens of this *Shrub* are so impaired, that from what remains, it&#x27;s difficult to reduce it to any certain *Tribe*.

11. Sweet Flowred *Angola*, *Odangee*, or *Odinjee Malab*. *Arbor Madraspatana floribus hexapetalis heptapetalifve, fructa coronato* Phil. Trans. No. 224, p. 313, Fig. 1.

This *Tree* grows 40 or 50 foot high, and thick as a lusty man&#x27;s middle, the *Flowers* smell sweet, while fresh.

A *Decoction* of the *Bark* of the *Root*, is good for colds and stiffness of the *Lambs*. Of the *Fruit* they make *Oyl* good for cold *Pains*, and serves their *Lamps*. S. B.

12. *Baccifera racemosa Madraspatana Lauri Cerasi foliis, floribus parvis numeroq[ui]simis* Phil. Trans. No. 224, p. 320. *Curaum chedde Malab.* This grows as thick as a man&#x27;s Leg, and 20 foot high, the fresh *Flowers* have a sweet smell. The *Fruit* they roast and eat. S. B.
14. Coodee Chittammuttee Malab.

This with Gunta Paringe, Succu. Tippelee mullu. Cha-
veum. Chitra-mullum. Candun-gatree. Nelawammoo.
Pantpauticum. Cutta mullee. Canjeeever. These ele-
ven they boil and drink the Decoction of, for all sorts
of intermitting Fevers. It is a weak Herb, and for the
most part Trails or lies on the Ground. S. B.

Dr Plukenet calls this in his Phytograph Tab. 132.
Fig. 3. Althea minima surrecta Veronicae villopis foliis e Ma-
draspatana. Yet in his Correct Mantissa gives it again
as new, with the Character of procumbens, which he
ought to acknowledge Mr Brown for, but how he
can prove it surrecta too, himself can only best in-
form us.

15. Coata-corundee Malab. Boordarum Indostan.

It grows in moist places, the Flower of a deep red
or purple, the whole Plant of a most grateful smell,
it grows sometimes a foot high. The Powder of this
with 3 or 4 other things they use for the Pox, a drink
of this with three more they cure Fevers. The bot-
tom Leaves are sometimes 3 or 4 inches long, and one
or two broad. S. B.

That most celebrated Botanist, Dr Plukenet, may ve-
ry well boast of his innumerable species of Plants, if he
multiplies others as he has done this, making it three
different Herbs, as you may see in the Philosophical
Transactions, No. 224. p. 382. Fig. 18.

16. Nalauppe Gent Mucotarre Malab.

A sort of Caper, being of the same Species with No.
8. It&#x27;s a prickly Bush about three foot high, the
Flowers sweet, the Fruit small and very bitter, the
whole Plant, that excepted, is good for the Pox, as
also for Fevers and Cough, mixed with other things.
S. B.
17. Caut-mulle Malab. Addewee-malle Gent.

Syringa scandens Madraspatana Fraxini foliis densioribus, claviculis donata Pluk. Phyt. Tab. 228. Fig. 1.

The clavícula to this Plant are wholly owing to the Doctor&#x27;s own donation, and had his Épithet of Scandens been also left out, it had been less maqueraded, being an erect Plant rising three or four foot high, and divides into many Branches, the Flower very fragrant, and Fruit small, which they soak in water all night to bring off the Husk, then Boyl it, which is good food. S. B.

18. Larustinus Madraspatanus trifoliatus. Punanchidde Malab.

This is a Shrub about five or 6 foot high, and as thick as a mans Thigh. The Natives mix the Juice of its Bark, which is very thick, with Lime, to make it last long, and by this means it becomes as hard as Stone. S. B.

Dr Plukenet confounds this Tree with his Arbor aromatica e Coromandel Laurinis foliis binis ternisve nostra Raij H. Pl. 1808. Phytogr. Tab. 14. Fig. 5. which if he had nicely considered the Flowers of, he would have found them very different, and his Leaves are sometimes 4 together, as well as 2 or 3, whereas this is constantly trifoliated.

19. Mr Du-Bois his Madrafs welted Sun-Flower.

Chrysanthemum parvum ramosissimum, membranaceo caule Madaraspaterse Pluk. Tab. 160. Fig. 5. Hist. Oxon. Sect. 6. p. 25. No.88. Charangulle Malab.

It&#x27;s a small low Plant six or eight inches high, of a faint sweet smell. It sometimes grows of itself in Gardens. S. B.

20. Ferrum Equinum majns Malabariense siliquis in summitate Comel in Hort. Malab. V. 9. Tab. 18. p. 31. Mus. Petiver. 53. Neer-pundo Gent. Neruchadday Malab.
This grows in the Water, the wood of the Branches which are very long and lye on the surface of the Tanks or Ponds curl&#x27;d in Rings one within another, is very light and spongy, and so soft, that you may squeeze it how you please. S. B.

Dr Plukenet hath not only needlessly and lamely Figured this Herb Tab. 309. No. 3. it being before much better done in the aforesaid Hort. Malab. but since that, to confound and multiply species, has given it again as New in his Mantis p. 140.

21. Lychnis Indica Gentianæ foliis, Febrifuga, Giritilla Zeylonensibus Mus. Petiver. 657. Narre comptee Malab.

This grows 6 or 8 inches high in wet places, the mid-day Sun parches it. S. B.

22. Centaurium elatius Clinopodij folio Hinguer-Pollumenfe caule hirto. Mucaorundce Malab.

This rises with slender weak Branches about 3 or 4 foot high, when fresh it smells like Chivches, the Natives eat it for pains in the back. S. B.

23. Ambrosia affinis e Madraspatan Persicariae folio Mus. Petiver. 605. Nonducallacree Malab.

This is a water Plant, grows 6 or 8 inches high, the Natives eat it. S. B.

24. Samolus Hinguer-Pollumensis Satureia rigidis foliis. Arraveenampoondoo. Malab.

This rises about a foot high, thrives best in hard ground. Boyl&#x27;d in Oyl of Coco-nut with other things, the Natives cure Palsies of long standing. S. B.

25. Genista tinctoria Madraspatana foliis sericeis. Nellacrandee Malab. It grows in hard ground 6 or 8 inches high. S. B. The Author of the Phytographia Tab. 205. Fig. 7. hath given a very imperfect Figure of this, under the title of Myosotis, an Epithet very different from the genus of the Plant.
26. Mallewamboo Malab. Trucaweampaue Gent. Margosa de Mato Portug. Of this Tree there are 3 sorts more, viz. Carreampelle, Nelle wampulle and Nalee weambboo. This here is the worst sort, and is only good for cold pains washing with the Decoction. The whole Tree is very bitter, is above 20 foot high, and as thick as a mans thigh; the Fruit is round. S.B. This is a species of the Azederack or Bead-tree.

27. Neala poondoo Malab. Grows in hard ground on the banks of Fields: This with four or five other things the Natives cure pains from Wind or Cold. S.B.

28. Ette Malab. Mutte chettu Gent. the Dutch call it Lignum Columbrinum.

This Tree is 15 or 20 foot high, as thick as a mans thigh, the fruit round, of an Orange colour when ripe, till then green. Some are as big as Apples, others but little bigger than Cherries. The Fruit, Leaves and Root beaten to mash, and boil&#x27;d in the Oyl press out of the Nimbo Kernels, is by the Natives used outwardly, and taken inwardly as a Sovereign Medicine against the poisonous bites of venomous Serpents, &amp;c. as also in the Palsie and old Aches, but they use not the Decoction of it in Wine nor Water, for Fevers, as the Dutch do. The Flowers are of an ash colour when fresh, and stink after an odd manner which I can&#x27;t describe. S.B.

Of this here are three sorts more, viz. Code Ettee, Nellawatachittu and Tetammarau. S.B.

This is a species of Nux Vomica, and there being several sorts of it, as Mr Brown here observes, it&#x27;s thought more proper to take another opportunity to give you the differences of them together.

29. Polygonum multiflorum Hinguer-pollumense. Nechetta-poondoo Malab.
This trails on the ground half a yard long, the Natives boil and eat it. S. B. It&#x27;s like our common Knotgrafs, but hath more Flowers and lesser Leaves.

30. Velacaunumboo Malab. and Gent.

It grows in hard ground, in dry places. S. B.

Were not Dr Plukenet too fond of the guilt he charges others withal, viz. to multiply species and confound Botany, he would not thus frequently make 2 or 3 plants of one, especially such he had reason to suspect, were by others very well described, as for example, this plant which seems little or nothing different from the Gnaphalium ad Stechadem citrinam accedens I. Bauhin. Vol. 3. lib. 26. p. 160. fig. chabr 371. Ray. H. Pl. 284. and which Dr Sloan in his Catalogue of Jamaica Plants, p. 125. observes to sport very much as well in its Heads as Leaves; Yet this the Doctor figures as a Non-descript. Tab. 187. f. 5. and after that in his Mantissa p. 92. he gives it again as new; which in so great a Botanist I would willingly believe proceeds rather from forgetfulness than design.

31. Ocimum Hinguer Pollumense floribus exiguis dense spicatis. Kerandee Chidde Malab.

This rises about a foot high, grows in dry places. S. B.

32. Kainepu Malab.

This has a pretty smell, tho&#x27; small, it grows in moist places. This is that you judged (Mr James Petiver) to be a species of Eye-bright; the Flower is blue near the middle, and white round the edges. S. B.

33. Pulandee Malab.

Bruised and boiled and mixt with Oyl of Aumeneconne (which Parkinson calls Ricinus sive Cataputia major vulgator) is a good Remedy for a Thrush in Childrens mouths; the Juice given 3 or 4 spoonfuls to a man for Cholick pains, gives 2 or 3 stools, and
in two or three days cures. It grows in dry places, about a foot high; has an herby taste. S. B.

Under this name here are two varieties, which Dr Plukenet has distinguished in his Phytographia, Tab. 86. Fig. 5. and 6. but since that in his Mantissa p. 154. (having forgot these,) he hath there dwindled them both into one new one.

34. Tamariscus Madraspatana Cupressi facie Mus. Petiver. 681. Autacore Malab.

This grows in sandy ground, which in the Rain time is overflowed. I take it for a species of Tamariske, but it grows not in this Country to any bigness; the thickest I ever saw here, was about as big as my wrist, and 3 or 4 foot high. S. B.

35. Samolus Madraspat. Gram. Leucanthemi foliis Philos. Transf. No. 224. p. 325. fig. 25. Where I have fully described it. My very worthy and ingenious Friend Mr Edward Bulkley Surgeon, at Fort St George tells me, being grownd with water and rubb&#x27;d on the Body, it cures the swellings thereof.

36. Conyza Madraspatana Carthami folio. Pukerande Malab. When fresh has a good smell. S. B.

After Dr Plukenet in his Mantissa p. 188. had given this amongst the Virga aureas as a new plant, he immediately corrects his Judgment, and supposes it may be more properly rankt amongst the Eupatorii, where, if he has not twice figured it, viz. Tab. 87. fig. 5. and Tab. 177. fig. 1. he would do well to set them in a clearer light, having very confusedly joyned other false synonyms to them, as that accurate Botanist Dr Herman hath also observed, and in some measure corrected in his Paradysus Batavus. p. 157.

37. Galeopsis Hingur-pollumentis flore minimo, spica tenuiore. Karundee poondoo Malab.

This grows in dry places, about afoot high, is good with other things for Childrens Fevers. S. B.
38. Vatakélugelepe Mal. Geleka-chittu Gent.

Dr Hermans yellow Malabar Rattle Broom with blunt leaves. Crotolaria Asiatica folio singulari cordiformi floribus luteis H. Leyd. 201. fig. and descr. Genista Malab. fol. singulari Floribus luteis, siliquis bulbatis Com. in H. Mal. Genistella Indica major, Salicis folio glabro obtuso cordiformi fl. luteo minore Breyn. prodr 2. Tandale-cotti H. Malab. Vol. 9. Tab. 25. p. Ray H. Pl. 1894.

This grows three foot high or more, in dry places. S. B.

39. Samolus Madraspat. floribunda, verticillis plurimis dense stipatis. Kalureevee Malab. Is hot, will raise Blisters and dissolve Buboes, if timely applyed, for which the Natives often use it. S. B.

This Dr Plukenet hath given us twice over, viz. Alm. Bot. in his Almag. p. 205. pl. 9 and Mantissa p. 112. It&#x27;s strange so nice a Botanist should rank this Herb amongst the Docks, from which Tribe it vastly differs, being full of capsules, and each containing many small Seed.

40. Sinapistrum Malabaricum diphyllon. Kaukau-poondoo. Malab. It grows about two foot high in dry places. S. B.

Dr Plukenet first communicates this to Mr Ray, (in his Hist. Plant. p. 1903.) under the improper Epithet Ray H.Pl. of Asclepiadi affinis siliquis foliaceis pappis destitutis; after which, without mentioning this Synonym (being fig. 5. Pluk I suppose ashamed of it) he figures it under another name, viz. of Sinapistrum in his 6oth Table fig. 5. and V. 9. Tab. to shew his strength of memory in the same Volume, 33. p. 61. Tab. 119. Fig. 7. he gives it again as new, with a worse Icon than before, and only supposes it to be the Cupa-Veela Hort. Malab. Vol. 9. Tab. 33. p. 61. which without doubt it is.
41. Dr Hermans blue Malabar Rattle-Broom.

Pee Tandale Cotti H. Mal. V. 9. Tab. 29. p. 53.

Crotalaria Asiatica folio singulari verrucofo floribus caeruleis H. Ludg. Bat. 199. Fig. and desc. Genistella major Indica Alni folio fl. caeruleo spicato Breyn. Pr. 2. p. 50. Genista Indica Alni folio floribus caeruleis, filiquis bullatis Comel. in H. Mal. Carpakelegelepe Malab.

This grows in dry places, about three foot high. S. B.

42. Kadali Madraspatana minor, capsulis pilosis. Caunampoondoo Malab. It grows in dry places about a foot high. S. B.

Dr Plukenet has figured this Tab. 173. f. 4. by the name of Echinophora, and two others of the same Genus, he has dispersed under different heads, the one he calls Cistus Chamaerodendros Tab. 161. Fig. 2. the other he has made a Lysimachia. To avoid this confounding of Genuses, I have chose to call them all by the Malabar name Kadali, under which title there are 3 or 4 of them described in Mr Ray&#x27;s Hist. Plant. taken from the Hortus Malab. Vol. Tab. 42. p. 87. &amp;c. as also 2 others in my Museum No. 245 and 246.

43. Hoary Willow-leaved Malabar yellow Rattle-Broom. Janapachidde Malab. Katou Tandale-cotti H. Mal. Vol. 9. Tab. 26. p. 47. Crotalaria Benghalensis foliis Genist subhirsutis P. Bat. Prod. Pluk. Tab. 169. Fig. 5. Crot. Malab. sylv. foliis singularibus majoribus floribus luteis Comel in H. Mal. Genistella Indica major, Salicis folio lanuginoso, flore luteo amplo Breyn. Pr. 2: p. 50.

This I observed in Flower, in the Right Reverend the Bishop of London, his Garden at Fulham, so that I very much wonder after all these synonyms and a Plant so well known, should by that critical Botanist Dr
Dr Plukenet, be given in his Mantissa pag. 58. as Pluk. 169. new, notwithstanding he had figured it before, yet at the same time might know it was better done in the aforesaid Hort. Malabaricus.

This grows about 4 foot high in dry places, the Natives make Twine and Ropes of it, and sometimes use it to fume those who have Fevers. S. B.

44. Malabar Arrowhead. Cooletteyella Malab. Grows in the water, the Natives use the root bruised to cure their sore feet, which they often have in wet weather going barefoot. S. B. See its Synonyms and comparative difference in the Philosop. Transf. No 224. p. 331. No. 39.

45. Convolulus Hinquer-Pollumensis, fol. cordato polyanthos, pediculis quasi spinosis. Moolepuncoodee Malab.

This Climer Dr Plukenet positively asserts to be the Scammonea Syriaca C B 295. or true Scamony of the Shops, which I am sure he has seen growing in the Apothecaries Physick Garden at Chelsea, but I believe never observed the footstalks of the Leaves to be endowed with thorn-like excrescencies, resembling that imperfect one, which he has figured Tab. 276. fig. 3. F. 3. Besides its Leaves, Flowers, Seed Vessels, and manner of growing are so very different, that he had no reason to suppose it the same.

46. Periploca Malabarica fol. angustissimo. Nan-na-ree-chedde Malab. Segunda-pala Gent.

This climbing Herb, Leaves, Root and Branch, the Natives boil with long Pepper, and drink the Decoction in continual Fevers, the Root is of a very sweet smell, and I believe of more use than they talk of. S. B.

After Dr Plukenet in his Almagestum Botanicum p. 37. pl. 2. had declared this to be the Apocynum angusto Salicis folio CB. 303. and that it was brought from
from Madraspatan; yet in his Mantissa p. 17. (I suppose only forgetting himself) he gives it again as New, with the Epithet of A. angustifolium breviori folio, disdaining the pains to consult the Hort. Malabar, where he might have found it very well Figured and Described, viz. Vol. 10. Tab. 34. p. 67. under the name of Narn Nindi.

47. Cambee Chedde Malab.

Pentaphora Madraspatana; Nerii flore, tubo longifimo Phil. Transact. No. 224. p. 331. pl. 38. where I have described its Leaves, Flowers and Fruit.

It rises 4 or 5 foot high, and as thick as a man&#x27;s Arm; the Natives eat the Fruit, when boyld &#x27;tis like a Myrobalan; is found in dry places. S. B.

Dr Plukenet ranks this amongst the Pruniferous Tribe, and if so, it&#x27;s very strange, being the only plum I have yet seen, with a Coronated Fruit, hard Shell, and many small Seed.</div>
