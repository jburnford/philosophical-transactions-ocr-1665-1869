<div class="ocr-text">V. Mr. Alexander Orme&#x27;s pectoral Syrup, sent in a Letter to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. &amp;c. from Culcutte, dated Jan. 25. 1733.

Some Uses of the pectoral Syrup.

A Drop or two, with a little Honey, given to newborn Infants, greatly helps the necessary cleansing of the Bowels. Three or Four Drops are a safe Puke for them, and cleanse the Stomach and Bowels from that Phlegm that causes their Gripes.

It is of great Service in most Asthma&#x27;s, and has relieved, when the best Remedies have failed. If the Fit is violent, give a large Spoonful of it, which will soon procure a Vomit or two. If the Fit is moderate, Two Tea Spoonfuls three times a Day will be sufficient.

In Fevers that are attended with a laborious Breathing, it has been found serviceable.

It is excellent in the Small-pox, as well to vomit in the Beginning, as to help on the necessary Salivation in the confluent Sort.

It helps Coughs, and promotes Expectoration.

From these few Hints, a Physician will be able to adjust its Use in other Distempers. I should not
recommend it, had not repeated Experience convinced me of its Usefulness: And that it may be of Use to Posterity, I mean to Physicians that are really such, I give the Receipt of it to be given to the President and Censors of the College of Physicians, London.

VI. A Letter from the Rev&#x27;d Mr. Henry Miles to Mr. John Eames, F. R. S. concerning the Seed of Fern.

SIR,

In the Edition which the celebrated Boerhaave and Gaubius have given us of Swammerdam&#x27;s Biblia Natura, sive Historia Insectorum, in Dutch and Latin, 2 Vol. in Fol. printed at Leyden 1737. and 1738. we have an Epistolary Dissertation on the Seed of the Male Fern, together with a very curious Cut, representing the Seed-vessels, their Mechanism, and the Seed, as viewed by a good Microscope; inserted at the End of the said History. The Cut I have attempted, with my unskilful Hand, to draw, as well as I could; and, possibly, it may help you to conceive of the Form of what it is designed to represent, in some measure.

The Author, I find, claims to himself the having first discovered the Seed of Fern, in his Dissertation, at the Beginning: &quot;You rightly judge&quot; (says he to his Friend) &quot;me to have been the first,&quot; &amp;c. Boerhaave says,</div>
