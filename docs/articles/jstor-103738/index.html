Supposing the Moon to be of this Diameter, the Comet Seem&#x27;d to me to be in proportion to this Circle; as above delineated.

II. Extract of a Letter from the Right Honourable
the Lord Paisley, F. R. S. to Mr. George
Graham, F. R. S. With some curious Figures
of the same Comet.

His Lordship being at Witham in Essex, where
he had the Advantage of a very clear Sky,
first discover&#x27;d this Comet on Friday the 11th of Octob.
last about 7 in the Evening; it then appeared not
much unlike a Star of between the 4th and 5th Mag-
nitudes, but a Haziness round the Head, and some
Light streaming from it on that Side that was oppo-
site to the Sun, induced him immediately to look
upon it as a small Comet; which his Observation
the next Evening abundantly satisfy&#x27;d him of. His
Lordship was very particular in the Notice he took
of its Appearance, and was pleased to communicate
the three curious annexed Figures [Fig. 1, 2, 3.] of it,
representing it on three several Nights, viz. the 11th,
13th and 15th of the same Month; some time after
which the Tail became so inconsiderable as hardly
to deserve any farther Description; as will be readily
judged from the Decrease of it between the 11th and
15th Days of the Month. The Tail was visible on
the 11th to near a Degrees Distance from the Body,
as his Lordship found by comparing it with some
known Distances in the Heavens; it was of a dusky
Light not unlike a Cloud growing darker and darker to-
wards its Extremity, as is express&#x27;d in the first Figure,
where, as well as in the two following, the white
Speck in the Head is intended to express the Bright-
ness
nefs of a small Star; from the Comparison of which with the Tail the Brightness of the latter may in some sort be collected: The Tail appear&#x27;d sharper, and not so much spread in the two following Observations, and in the last did not exceed one third Part of the first Length; it was then of a much darker Colour, which made the Difference between that and the Head more observable, the Head yet appearing sufficiently bright. For some following Nights his Lordship&#x27;s Observations were interrupted by cloudy Weather, after which the Comet was so far diminish&#x27;d, as only to be known by its Motion, its Appearance being no ways distinguishable from that of a small nebulose Star.

III. Observatio ejusdem Cometae ab Illustrißimo Domino Francisco Bianchini habita Albani Mensae Octobri, 1723. &amp; ab eodem Ulyssiponem missa P. Joanni Baptistæ Carbone Soc. f E S N. Commuicavit Isaacus Samuda, M.D. Col. Med. Lond. L. S. R. S.

Die 17 Octobris, postquam Jovialium Comitum situm observavsem forte in Constellationem Capricorni oculos conieci; cumque astra singula percurrerem, in quamdam veluti nebulosam stellam incidi, caeteris sane grandiorem, quam tamen ibidem loci numquam antea observaram. Rei novitate perscrutatus, eo Telescopium direxi, statimque Cometæ esse deprehendi; siquidem tenuissimæ nebulæ globus apparuit, ejusque in medio veluti lucidus nucleolus. Idem quoque nudis oculis discernere licuit; &amp; praeter</div>
