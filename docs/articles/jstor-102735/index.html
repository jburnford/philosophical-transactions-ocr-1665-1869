<div class="ocr-text">Part of a Letter to Dr Sloane, wherein is an account of a Double Pear.

The Errors of Nature deservedly claim a place in her History, being of great use to illustrate her Ordinary and more Regular Motions.

I will take the liberty of presenting you (under this style) with an account of a Phenomenon in Botanics, I met with the last Autumn. It was a Double Pear: one part growing over, and being fixt in the other, not unlike an Acorn in its Cup. I at first question&#x27;d, whether this might not be artificial, but a little examination discover&#x27;d it to be the Work of Nature, tho very unlike her common Productions. That which was most surprizing was, that from the edges of the lower Pear there grew up five Leaves of various Magnitude, at distances almost equal from each other. The largest of them was one inch long, half an inch broad, as large again as the smallest Leaf. These Leaves grew out of the Skin of the lower Pear, and had no Fibres rising from the carious part of it. One of the Leaves (the largest of them) had a Fibre of the bigness of a small hair, continu&#x27;d from the place where the Leaf rise, down, just within the skin, and loose from it to the Pedunculus. The outer Coat of the Pedunculus was continu&#x27;d to the Skin of the lower Pear, and this Skin to that of the upper Pear. The inner Fibres of the Pedunculus go thro the lower up into the upper Pear, and disperse themselves in it. The upper part was twice as big as the lower, and had several Kernels in it; but the lower none at all.</div>
