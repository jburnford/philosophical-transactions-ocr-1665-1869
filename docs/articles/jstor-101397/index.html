<h2 data-pagefind-ignore>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">He concludes the whole with four Chapters, whereof the first treats of the Pores and Figures of Volatil Salts, corresponding to those of the Brain, Heart, Blood, Nerves: The second compares Volatil Salt with Quicksilver, which he takes to be nothing else but a Volatil Salt: The third examines, whether Volatil Salts are contained in Mixts actually or potentially: The fourth inquireth, whether all Volatil Salts are of the same kind.

So much of this Author; whose way not being here made out and declared, we hope, a Learned and very knowing Member of the R. Society, Doctor Daniel Coxe, will shortly supply the world with that defect, he being certainly and experimentally master of a sure and easy way of extracting the Volatil Salt out of all sorts of Plants.

Hearing of great complaints of the Rot of Sheep in many parts of England; we thought, it would not be unwelcome to the Reader, to be, on such an occasion, directed, for a good and cheap way of preventing the disease, to what the Honourable Robert Boyle hath publish&#x27;d in his second Tome of the Usefulness of Natural Philosophy, printed at Oxford A.1671. p. 15. The short whereof is; That a great Sheepmaster lately preserv&#x27;d his Flocks in a moist Country, when most of his neighbours lost theirs; and that he did it by the bare use of (Spanish) Salt, of which each Sheep, being first made to bleed a little under the Eye, was made to take down a small handful, two or three times (with some days of interval,) without being suffer&#x27;d for some hours to drink any thing after it.
