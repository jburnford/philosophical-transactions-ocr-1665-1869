Mr. Henry Baker F. R. S. to Martin Folkes Esq; President of the Royal Society, concerning the Earthquake felt at London Feb. 8, 1749-50.

Read Feb. 8, 1749-50.

As I was walking along Chancery-lane To-day, towards Holbourn, about 40 Minutes past 12 o&#x27;Clock, People came out of several Houses to their Doors in great Surprise, complaining of the shaking of their Houses, and imputing it to the Fall of some great Timber, or other heavy Body, which they suppos&#x27;d at some little Distance from them, and which they came out to inquire after.

When I was got into Holbourn, I found the People under the same Consternation, and expressing themselves nearly in the same manner.

Going to Gray&#x27;s-Inn, many People were got together in the great Square, talking about the Shock they had felt; and in particular a Lamp-lighter was giving an Account, that, being on his Ladder, pouring Oil into a Lamp, he was in Danger of falling off, by somebody&#x27;s shaking the Ladder, as he at first imagined.

I then went to a Gentleman&#x27;s Chambers under Gray&#x27;s Inn Library, where I was told the Shaking had been so much, that they thought a Clock would have been thrown down; and imagin&#x27;d at the time, some large Box or Heap of Books had been tumbled down over Head.
The People in all the Streets, as I returned home, were talking of this Matter; and some of the Women complaining that the Motion had made them sick.

My own Family, in Catherine-street in the Strand, had been no less surprised, and had sent to the Neighbours to inquire if some heavy thing had fallen down, to occasion the Shaking of the House, which Mrs. Baker described as very great: She sat in the Dining-Room, which is to the Street, and her Belief at the Instant was, that the Servant was fallen all along in the backward Room of the next Story higher, thereby shaking the House, and making a considerable Noise.

My Son felt the same Shock at the Tower; where also a Gentleman, who was sitting at a Table to write, in his House in the Mint, was thrown out of his Chair with a considerable Force towards the Table; and where every Body was much shock&#x27;d with the Apprehension of some Explosion of Gunpowder.

What therefore so many People, in different Streets, at great Distances from each other, have been surprized at, cannot be only Fancy, but must be owing to some real Cause; and if no Powder-Mill, or Magazine of Powder has been blown up, it must have been an Earthquake, or some Tremor of the Earth itself.

I was pretty curious to inquire of People in different Places, to judge the better from their several Reports; and I found them agree, almost in general, in the first Supposition of some weighty Body falling; most said with a Noise, but some seemed uncertain as to that. I endeavour&#x27;d likewise to learn
learn its Course, by comparing the Accounts of People in different Situations: It seems to have lain East and West, and to have passed from the West Eastward. I felt nothing of it myself as I walked the Street, nor do I find that many who were walking did.

I hope you will please to excuse this hasty Account, and permit me to assure you that I am, with all possible Respect,

SIR,

Catherine-street, Feb. 8.
4th p.m. 1749-50.

Your most obedient
humble Servant,

H. Baker.

An Account of the Shock of an Earthquake, felt Feb. 8. 1749-50: By Gowin Knight M. B. &amp; F. R. S.

Read Feb. 8. TO-DAY, betwixt 12 and 1 o’Clock, 1749-50. the House in which I live in Lincoln’s-Inn Fields was shook violently for a Moment. The Room where I was shook very much, but nothing was thrown down. In another Room the Grate was seen to move, and the Fire-shovel was thrown down. A Maid-Servant that was above-stairs was much frighten’d with the Shock and Noise: She said, she heard a Sound like Thunder, which</div>
