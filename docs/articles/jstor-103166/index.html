<div class="ocr-text">V. A Relation of the Effects of a Storm of Thunder and Lightning at Sampford-Courtenay in Devonshire, on October the 7th 1711. Communicated by John Chamberlayne Esq; F. R. S.

In the Parish of Sampford-Courtenay near Oakhampton in Devon, on the 7th of October, about 3 or 4 o&#x27;clock in the Afternoon, there was a great darkness as the Minister was Catechising the Children, that he could hardly see with Spectacles: And as soon as Prayers were over, some young Men went to ringing, as commonly they used to do; and there were several People in the Church Porch talking; and of a sudden, a great Fire-Ball fell in between them, and threw some one way, some another; but no one was hurted. The Ringers said, they never knew the Bells go so heavy in all their lives, and were forced to leave off; And being very weary, and looking out of the Belfrey into the Church, saw 4 Fire-Balls more, a little bigger than a Man&#x27;s Fist, which of a sudden broke to pieces; so that the Church was full of Fire and Smoak.

John Goodman&#x27;s Man received a full Blow in the Neck, which caused him to bleed both at Nose and Mouth; but is very well now. He says, that the Fire and Smoak went up into the Tower, which broke a great Beam which one of the Bells hung on, and the Gudging breaking, the Bell fell on the Floor. It likewise carried away one of the Pinacles of the Tower next the Town, and threw some of the Stones near a Barn Door at a pretty distance from the Church, and hath done some Damage to the Barn at one end. The Chimney of the House was
was removed in such a manner by the Thunder and Lightning, that all People did admire it stood, and not fall upon the House. And tho&#x27; the People ran up and down in a great Consternation at the dreadful Thunder and Lightning, yet no body was hurt.

This Relation comes from the Minister who then officiated.

VI. Some Microscopical Observations upon Muscles, and the manner of their Production. In a Letter from Mr. Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, F.R.S.

Delft, June the 10th 1712. N. S.

I have observ&#x27;d a great many Years ago, that the Shell Fish call&#x27;d Muscles, lay their Eggs upon the outside of their Shells; and that so regularly one by another, that they may be compared to a String or Band. These Eggs, or imperfect Muscles lying upon the Shells, do continually increase in Strength, till at last they come to be perfect Muscles; but then you may see remaining upon the Shells a part of the Egg-shell, which sticks fast to the said Shell, till the Skin or Membrane, wherewith the Muscles are encompassed, is changed.

In the Month of August 1710. I procured some Muscles, and dissected them according to the best of my Power; and found within the Shells on both sides of the Muscle, against the Parts of the Fish, very thin and weak Membranes; which I have taken often out of the Muscles, and placing them before a Microscope I have seen such a vast Number of Motions in the said Membranes; that it is not to be described either by Pen or Words; and I show&#x27;d the same likewise to other Persons: And</div>
