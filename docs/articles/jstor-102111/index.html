To The

RIGHT HONORABLE

FULKE LORD BROOKE

Of

Beauchamp&#x27;s-Court.

My Lord;

Having Compleated the fifteenth Volume of the Philosophical Transactions, (which contains part of the great Stock of Experimental Learning, communicated to the Royal Society the last year,) I now Humbly Dedicate it to Your Lordship; a Person of Honor, always ready to Favor, whatever makes for the Improvement of Knowledge, and the Public Good.

But this imperfect Character of Your Lordship, tho&#x27; of it self sufficient to justify the present Address, is not the only Inducement to it: I could mention, how much We are all indebted to Your Lordship, for a Uniform and Steady Loyalty to the King, and a Pious Love for Your Country:
I might add, That Your Lordship&#x27;s Kindness has reacht the Publisher of these Tracts, and made Him wholly Your Own: But I must take care, not to be Uneasy to Your Lordship; who is more inclined to Do great things, then to Hear of them after they are done.

Wherefore, I shall only recommend to Your Lordship&#x27;s Patronage and Protection, the following Discourses: Some of which retreive lost Peices of Antiquity, (as the Incombustible Cloth, &amp;c.) and by these means add to the Authority of the Antients, who have suffered in their Reputation by Our Ignorance: Others extend the bounds of Learning, and inform Mankind by New Discoveryes: These are all presented to Your Lordship, in token of a much greater Debt, from,

My Lord,

Your Lordship&#x27;s most Obedient Humble Servant,
WILLIAM MUSGRAVE,
Reg. Soc. Sec.
Beginning the fifteenth Volume.
