MR. HENRY SMEATHMAN, who was many years a pupil of the late Mr. Rice, and before he went on his travels, practised with success that Author&#x27;s ingenious method of teaching to read, speak and write, with ease, energy and propriety; begs leave to offer his services to the public in the same mode of useful and polite instruction.

Gentlemen intending themselves for the Church, the Bar or the Senate, will by oral and familiar conversation, in a few months, receive more improvement, than by a solitary study of many years, in an art not taught in our Schools or Universities, yet absolutely necessary to those who wish to excel in public or polite life, or aspire to eminence in eloquence and literature.

By this art, a liberal education is improved and accomplished, classical learning advantageously displayed, and the want of a proficiency in the dead and other languages supplied, as by Mr. Smeathman&#x27;s method, founded on that of Mr. RICE, the pupils may acquire a critical knowledge of the idiom and elegance of their own without them.
This recommends it peculiarly to the attention of all those who wish to have the pleasure of reading the English classic authors with grace and propriety, or to write and speak correctly; of those Gentlemen, who are intended for the Navy, the Army, the Public-office or the Counting-house; or whose juvenile studies may have been obliterated by an early introduction into those situations; and of all those who may have been deprived of the advantages of a liberal education.

They are effectually cured of any defects in pronunciation, which do not arise from an imperfection in the organs of speech; and instead of provincial, disagreeable or absurd habits, they acquire an energetic, a persuasive and a graceful manner of speaking, reading and reciting. Above all, the younger pupils receive this singular and important advantage, that their minds are opened more early, their reason is assisted in its exertions, and directed to such objects as naturally promote the perfection, and the happiness of human beings.

This method is equally well adapted to both sexes, those advanced in life may receive instruction privately, as usual, and Ladies will be attended at their own houses.

Application may be made to Mr. Smeathman, at his Chambers, No 14. Clement&#x27;s-Inn. Of whom, in a few days, may be had a short Treatise on the nature of eloquence, and the importance of learning to read, speak and write our own language, independent of all others; with a plan of his mode of teaching, and the advantages to be derived from it.

The following are detached extracts from the above-mentioned Treatise.

&quot;Those
&quot;Those who have not studied and been exercised in reading, speaking or composing, in their own language, will not do either in such a manner as to claim or deserve attention; and it is the talent of performing them with ease, energy and propriety, which we call eloquence.

&quot;People are usually very solicitous to have their children instructed in all those liberal arts, which are deemed requisite to perfect them as Gentlemen and Scholars: and surely as nothing contributes more to this intention, they would not omit oratory, if they thought it was to be learned. They listen with rapture to the charms of eloquence, but are not aware that it is in their power to procure this inestimable talent for those who are the objects of their incessant care and daily anxiety.&quot;

&quot;This can only arise from the erroneous idea that oratory is not to be taught or acquired. Yet no art is more simple in its Principles, or clearer in its rules, and no rules are more easily reduced to practice, or more certainly practised with success.&quot;

&quot;It is granted that people may improve themselves much by private declamation. The art of eloquence, however, is in this respect like fencing, in which a man can learn very little by pushing against a wall: he may indeed strengthen his muscles, and enable himself to bear the fatigue, but it is by frequent exertion with a master only that he can expect to acquire skill.&quot;
&quot;It is from the friendly observations, the oral information,
the frequent contentions and the unrestrained corrections,
of a skilful companion, that a student in oratory can derive
essential improvement: writing alone can no more commu-
nicate the art than it can speech to the dumb.

Those therefore who educate their children for eminent
stations in life, with the hope that they will one day render
themselves conspicuous in the Senate, the Church or the
courts of Law and Justice, without having them grounded in
the first principles of eloquence, expect to reap where they
have not sown: they must in all probability be disappoint-
ed.&quot;

&quot;There is scarce a man of a moderate age and capacity not
born with some invincible imperfection in the organs of
speech, who may not in twelve months be enabled to com-
municate his thoughts with pleasure to his audience, and
credit to himself; or so to read the Liturgy as to excite
Devotion in the most lukewarm, and to confirm it by a na-
tural, persuasive and convincing manner of delivering the
great and essential truths of Religion; and how much this
is to be wished is left to the opinion of all who have heard
the disgusting and unedifying manner in which the finest
compositions are generally delivered in our public places of
worship, and seen the awkward figures some of our learned
Senators make when they attempt to speak in Parliament.&quot;

&quot;We have hitherto treated only of the most obvious advan-
tages arising from the study of eloquence. On a closer
view,&quot;
&quot;view, many other important benefits will be found to be
derived from it. Of these, opening the mind, improving
the heart and infusing a desire of knowledge, deserve par-
ticular notice. Such is the tendency, effect and benefit, of
the mode of instruction here recommended; for as it applies
directly to the understanding without burthening the me-
mory, or perplexing the mind, the youngest pupils recur
to it with delight; and its uncommon success, when at-
tempted, has arisen from the immediate conviction which
they feel, that our path to knowledge is pleasant, and
the possession of it highly advantageous and desirable.&quot;

&quot;Our youth are generally very defective in those polite
Branches of Knowledge without which classical Learning is
of little use. Their manners frequently continue rough and
puerile, when they ought to be, graceful and manly, their
speech inarticulate or slovenly, diffonant or defective, dis-
agreeable, and often unintelligible; and very few, even
among those who are good scholars, can read or write their
own language with ease or propriety: an accomplishment
absolutely necessary to those who wish to derive any advan-
tage from extensive knowledge or profound erudition.&quot;

&quot;Young People are naturally emulous of the company of
persons respectable either for their Rank or Abilities, and if
they pass their time with low or ignorant people it is for
want of being properly introduced and accustomed to mix in
the conversation of men of polished manners and liberal ac-
complishments.&quot;

&quot;The mode of Instruction here recommended, must neces-
sarily in its Course remove these Defects, and the prejudices.&quot;
intailed on them; and promote the acquisition of those
usefull arts, on which the Success of life so much depends.&quot;

&quot;In the prosecution of it their Curiosity is excited and di-
rected to proper objects, and a desire for general knowledge
the great foundation of excellence, implanted by making them
acquainted with such remarkable things in nature and art
as are worthy of Attention. Instead of a slovenly or ungrace-
full mode of speaking, they are taught to deliver their senti-
ments with propriety and precision according to times and
circumstances; consequently their manner when improper
is reformed insensibly, and without appearing an object of
attention; their Minds are cultivated by frequent appeals
to their understanding, and their judgements regulated by
the constant habit of observation and reflection, exercised
in a Minute enquiry into the Truth and propriety of such
thoughts as they are directed to in the course of their study.
Thus being early qualified for the company of well bred and
intelligent people they appear with becoming confidence and
satisfaction on all occasions.&quot;</div>
