<div class="ocr-text">XVI. An Account of a remarkable Marine Insect: In a Letter of Mr. Andrew Peter Du Pont, to Mr. Emanuel Mendez da Costa, Librarian to the R. S.

Dear Sir,

Read March 10, 1763.

My friend Robert Long, Esq; of Jamaica, favoured me with the drawing and description of a marine insect he took up at sea. I believe it is a non-descript, and as you have often desired me to communicate to you any observations worthy attention to present to the Royal Society, I send you this to communicate to that learned body, if you deem it worthy their notice. I shall always think it a pleasure to tender my respects in whatever I can to the Society, which pray assure them of. I am, with great esteem,

Dear Sir,

Your very obliged friend,

and humble servant,

Chiswel-Street,
Jan. 17, 1763.

Andrew Peter Dupont.
August 13, 1762.

In a calm on my voyage to England, on board the Friendship, captain Thompson, two persons swimming took up this most singular creature floating on the surface. Its motions muscular. Its length a little more than one inch. Four small and short horns, probably its eyes. It protruded them in the water only; an orifice in the front part seeming its mouth. Two round spots opaque, marked A, possibly respiracula. The mid-line of the back part appeared through a common magnifier like a silver leaf, and was in continual undulating motion, either from the muscles or circulation of juices. Two side lines extending the whole creature&#x27;s length, and ending in one in the tail of a deep blue. The fingers, or tentacles, end in a deep blue; a silvery cast intermixed with the blue over the whole back, or upper parts, where the blue is lighter. Vide Tab. III.

This figure is a magnified drawing by the common hand-microscope. It can turn itself on the back by a muscular contraction of the head part, the tail and ramified arms inwards. The inferior parts are white.

It died the third day, though the water was shifted once every day.
