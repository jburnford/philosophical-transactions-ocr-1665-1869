LXXXV. Extract of a Letter to Dr. Maty, F. R. S. from Geneva, concerning the Introduction and Success of Inoculation in that City.

Read June 18, 1752. IN September 1750, the practice of inoculating the small-pox was first introduced into Geneva. The example was set by a young lady; and was, the next year, follow&#x27;d in the hospital of foundlings, where it was admitted by an order of the governors, and authorized by the magistrates.
trates. Their method of doing it was generally the same, which is now commonly used in England; whence instructions were sent to Geneva, when they first began to inoculate. Yet three persons were inoculated in a new manner. These were blister&#x27;d slightly, by means of a small vesicatory applied to that part of the arm, where the incision is usually made. The blister occasion&#x27;d by this plaister was open&#x27;d, and a pledgit dipp&#x27;d in the pocky matter was applied to the excoriated part. In one instance the incision was made only in one arm; the success of which was the same, as when it had been made in both. Some pocky matter was made use of, which had been kept three weeks; and some, that had even been kept four months, without any apparent difference in the effects from that which was fresh; unless it was owing to this, that, in one instance, the small-pox came out four days later than the usual time.

The experience, which they have hitherto had in Geneva, has suggested to them a conjecture, that the incision ought to be made deeper, where the matter, which is used, has been kept some time. All, who have yet been inoculated in Geneva, have recover&#x27;d; and the far greater number of them have had but an inconsiderable number of pustules.</div>
