<div class="ocr-text">as they are upon the Natural Place; and the Island itself, with all its Inequalities, and Hills and Dales; the Town, the Fort, the little Houses, Platform, and Canons mounted; and even the Gardens and Platforms of Trees, with their green Leaves standing upright, as if they were growing in their Natural Colours: In fine, Men, Beasts, and whatever you may imagine to have any protuberancy above the level of the Sea. This new, delightful, and most instructive form of Map, or Wooden Country, you are to look upon either Horizontally, or sidelong, and it affords equally a very pleasant object.

Some Anatomical Observations of Milk found in Veins, instead of Blood; and of Grass, found in the Wind-pipes of some Animals.

A curious Person wrote not long since from Paris, that there they had, in the House of a Physician, newly open&#x27;d a Mans Vein, wherein they found Milk, instead of Blood. This being imparted to Mr. Boyle at Oxford, his Answer was, That the like Observation about white Blood, had been made by a Learned Physician of his acquaintance, and the thing being by him look&#x27;d upon as remarkable, he was desirous to have it very circumstantially from the said Physician himself, before he would say more of it. The next Moneth may bring us in this Account.

The other Particular, mention&#x27;d in the Title of this Head, came in a Letter, sent also by Mr. Boyle, in these words:

I shall acquaint you, That two very Ingenious Men, Dr. Clark, and Dr. Lower, were pleas&#x27;d to give me an account of a pretty odd kind of Observation: One of them assuring me, That he had several times, in the Lungs of Sheep, found considerable quantity of Grass in the very Branches of the Aspera Arteria: And the other relating to me, That a few Weeks since, He, and a couple of Physicians,
tians, were invited to look upon an ox, that had for two or three days almost continually held his Neck straight up, and was dead of a Disease, the Owner could not conjecture at; whereupon, the parts belonging to the Neck and Throat, being open&#x27;d, they found, to their wonder, the Aspera Arteria in its very Trunk all stuff&#x27;d with Grass, as if it had been thrust there by main force: which gives a just cause of marvelling and inquiring, both how such a quantity of Grass should get in there; and how, being there, such an Animal could live with it so long.

Of a place in England, where, without petrifying Water, Wood is turned into Stone.

The same Searcher of Nature, that was alledged in the immediately precedent Observations, did impart also the following, in another Letter from Oxford, where he saith:

I was a while since visited by a Gentleman, who tells me, That he met with a Place in these parts of England, where, though there be no petrefying Springs (for that I particularly asked) Wood is turned into Stone in the Sandy Earth it self, after a better manner then by any Water I have yet seen: For I had the Curiosity to go to look upon pieces of Wood, he brought thence, and hope for the opportunity of making some tryals to examine the matter a little further, then I have yet been able to do. Thus far that Letter.

Since which time, He was pleased to give this further Information of the same matter, with a Maniffest of some other Particulars, belonging to this Subject, in these Words.

I was lately making some Tryals with the petrified Wood I told you off, which I finde to be a very odd substance, wonderfully hard and fixed: If I had opportunity to Re-print the History of Fluidity and Firmness, I could adde divers things about Stones, that perhaps would not be disliked; and I hope, if God vouchsafe me a little leisure,</div>
