<div class="ocr-text">XI. Experiments for ascertaining the Velocity of Sound, at Madras in the East Indies. By John Goldingham, Esq. F. R. S.

Read February 20, 1823.

The manner in which sound is conveyed, and the theory of its velocity, are too well known, and are to be found in too many scientific works, to need detailed repetition here. The actual rate of its motion, particularly in different states of the atmosphere, does not appear, however, to have been so well agreed upon by Philosophers. A scientific writer* in a standard work, states &quot;That some of the most eminent philosophers, judging that the knowledge of the flight of sound might be of use on various occasions, have been at extraordinary pains and expense to measure the rate at which it moved; and the result of their experiments, particularly of those which were best conducted, is as follows:

1. &quot;That the velocity of sound is the same, whether by sea or by land, in dry or in rainy weather, by day or by night, in winter or summer.

2. &quot;That sound, whether more or less strong, flies with the same swiftness. For, by experiments, a cannon fired with a half-pound charge of powder was heard at about the distance of seventeen miles and a half in the same time after the flash was seen, as it was when fired with a charge of 6lbs.

* Robertson.
3. &quot;That the times in which sound is heard are proportional to the distance; that is, at a double distance it is heard in twice the time; at a triple distance in thrice the time,&quot; &amp;c.

This, however, is not supported in all points by the experiments I am about to detail; nor indeed could we expect it would be, from the manner in which sound is conveyed; as this leads us to the conclusion, that the more dense, and the less elastic, the atmosphere, the slower sound would travel.

The velocity of sound has been variously given by different philosophers, as the following table,* originally from the Philosophical Transactions, will tend to show.

To these may be added the following results of more modern experiments and calculations.

In Chili the thermometer 73.5, barometer 27.44 in. sound was found to travel 1227 feet in a second. By Mr. Millington 1130 feet.

Mr. Richard Van Rees has shown theoretically that the velocity of sound in common air is 341.54 metres in a second.

Mr. Bengenberg at Dusseldorf, by experiment, 333.7 metres, about 2 feet and a half more, it is stated, than the velocity obtained at Paris by experiment.

* Being a portion of a dissertation by Mr. Derham, who, if I recollect right, makes the velocity the same as Flamsteed and Halley.

MDCCCXXIII.
Mr. Goldingham&#x27;s experiments

A metre, according to the accurate investigations lately made in England, contains $39,370.79$ English inches, and therefore $341,54$ metres will be equal to $1120$, and $333,7$ to $1094.8$ English feet.

&quot;Some curious experiments were made relative to sound by Messrs. de Thury, Maraldi, and de la Caille, upon a line $14636$ fathoms in length, having the tower of Mount Lheri at one end, and the pyramid of Montmartre at the other extremity, their Observatory was placed between the two objects. The result of their observations was, that sound moves $173$ French* fathoms in a second when the air is calm.

1. That sound moves with the same degree of swiftness whether it is strong or weak, an explosion of half a pound of powder discharged in a box, having been heard in the same space of time, as the report of a great gun charged with nearly six pounds of powder.

2. That the motion of sound is uniform, its velocity neither accelerating nor diminishing through the whole course of its progress.

3. That sound travelled at the same rate, whether the gun be pointed perpendicular to the horizon, or towards the person who hears the report, or from him—by other experiments however, the progress of sound appeared to be impeded by a strong wind.&quot;

Dr. G. Gregory, Econ. of Nat.

The velocity in the foregoing table, stated to be Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s, does not agree with that given by himself, which is $979$ feet; this however is not deduced from experiment, but from the theory, no regard being had to the thickness of the solid particles of air, through which sound is propagated. This being allowed for, according to the formula,

* Or $1106\frac{1}{4}$ English feet.
brings out the velocity of sound greater in the proportion of ten to nine, or 109 feet more, making the velocity 1088 feet; besides, vapours are dispersed through the air, which being of a different tone and elasticity, do not partake of the motion of the true air, by which sound is propagated; and it is also demonstrated, that the motion of sound will be quicker in such an atmosphere than in an atmosphere of true air, in the ratio of twenty-one to twenty; then the velocity last found being augmented in that proportion, we shall have 1142 feet for the velocity of sound in a second, according to Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory.

La Place, using the Newtonian formula, which he considers correct, and a theorem which he gives, makes the velocity of sound in a second 345.35 metres (or 1133.06 feet English) the temperature being 43°. The French Academicians, as before mentioned, found the velocity 337.18 metres, or 1106\(\frac{1}{4}\) feet English. By experiments of Lacaille the velocity was 344.42 metres, 1130.1 feet English, but the temperature is not mentioned.

In the above enumeration of the velocity of sound, given by different philosophers, very considerable discordances are observable; the actual reason of which cannot, I imagine, be discovered without the details of the experiments, and these are not in my possession; but probably, a particular examination of the experiments I am about to submit, may furnish a clue for the discovery of the cause of these differences. Halley and Flamsteed are the only two, whose results agree with the theory; but I am not quite certain whether their results were deduced from theory or experiment. Be this as it may, the conclusion drawn from the experiments
Mr. Goldingham&#x27;s experiments

made here agrees, in a very satisfactory manner, with that given by Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory, and by the two other celebrated men just named.

Between the years 1793 and 1796 a considerable number of observations were taken by myself, and under my superintendence, at the Observatory, with the view of ascertaining the velocity of sound. Not having the exact distances of the guns from the station when I returned to England, I wrote for farther information upon the subject—which I had not obtained when I quitted Europe again. I therefore did not bring these experiments forward at the time; and having a more elevated station to observe from, by the erection of a new building, and the advantage of corroborating distances, by the trigonometrical survey carrying on under the superintendence of Colonel Lambton, I entered upon the course of experiments about to be detailed. The former experiments (those of 1793 and 1796) were made with Arnold&#x27;s chronometers, as were these now given. In examining works obtained from libraries here, since I closed these experiments, for information relative to the results of like experiments by other observers, I found a letter from Colonel Beaufoy, in the Annals of Philosophy, addressed a few years ago to Dr. Thomson; and recommending to be done in England, what, in all the essential points, has been performed here, as will appear by the following extract:

&quot;It has frequently excited my surprise, as well as regret, and in which I am no wise singular, that use has not been made of the admirable Trigonometrical Survey, begun by the late General Roy, and continued with so much ability and attention by Colonel Mudge and Professor Dalby, to
make experiments on the velocity of sound; and however experiments of this kind may have been neglected, it is hoped that the present Master General of the Ordnance, a near relation of the late scientific Captain Phipps, (afterwards Lord Mulgrave) will, for the purpose of perfecting a branch of science, no less curious than useful, order a series of experiments of this nature to be undertaken, not only in the inland parts of the kingdom, but also on different parts of the Coast.&quot;

He then mentions that the experiments should be made under different circumstances of the wind and weather, and at different times of the 24 hours, and proceeds to enumerate the stations where the experiments should be made. He recommends that pocket chronometers should be used, &quot;which generally making five beats in two seconds, the velocity of sound could be determined to the fraction of a second;&quot; and concludes by saying, &quot;he has no doubt scientific foreigners would assist our countrymen in finding the time sound is travelling across that part of the Channel, where the shores are visible from each other.&quot;

At Fort St. George (Madras) a morning and an evening gun are fired from the ramparts, as is customary in fortified places, the former at day light, and the latter at eight o&#x27;clock in the evening. At St. Thomas&#x27;s Mount, the artillery cantonment, morning and evening guns are also fired, one at day light, and the other at sun set. The Madras Observatory, in latitude $13^\circ 4&#x27; 8&#x27;&#x27;$ north, is situated between these; the distance of it from the Fort, about half its distance from the Mount, the Fort being to the N.E. of the Observatory, and the Mount to the S.W. In former years, as I have mentioned before, experiments were made by me for ascertaining
the velocity of sound, but were not brought forward. And a new building,* elevated so as to give a commanding view of the country, particularly of the Mount† and Fort‡, having been erected, I commenced a new series with the morning and evening guns of both places. The experiments with the Mount gun, it will be seen, comprise an interval, which embraces all the varieties of the wind and weather during the revolution of the sun; the interval with the Fort gun is less, in consequence of the morning and evening guns having been fired from different parts of the ramparts, after the date at which the Fort experiments close. All the experiments were made with chronometers, which had 100 beats in 40 seconds, sometimes by three observers, myself and two of the Observatory Bramin assistants, but generally by two: the observers having repaired to the station at the top of the Observatory building, a little before the expected time, and each holding his chronometer so that he could distinctly hear the beats, began to count the instant he saw the flash, and continued counting until he heard the report; the number of beats between the flash and report was then immediately put down upon a slip of paper, by each observer, without communication with the others, and the papers delivered to me for their contents to be registered; the height of the thermometer, barometer, and hygrometer, with the direction of the wind and state of the weather, were also observed at the time, and registered; and in this manner the whole of the

* The station on this building is about 55 feet above the level of the sea, distant in a direct line 4500 yards.

† The Mount gun is about 120 feet above the level of the sea.

‡ The Fort gun is about 30 feet above the level of the sea..
experiments were made. The situations of the guns with respect to the station from which the observations were taken, was very favourable, being in the direction, one of N.E. and the other of the S.W. monsoons—with the southerly wind and sea breeze, (both which prevail at certain seasons of the year,) blowing between the two. The guns used were 24 pounders, charged with 8lbs. of powder, and both pointed, not exactly towards the station, but in a direction not far from it.

The distances were ascertained with great care: first, by a survey made for the purpose, a base having been measured, and the angles taken with a grand circular instrument, similar to that used on the trigonometrical surveys.* Secondly, by using two or three of Colonel Lambton&#x27;s distances and bearings found by the trigonometrical survey.

The results were thus deduced, and verified in different ways; and I have reason to think that the distances of the guns from the Observatory station are very accurately given. The mean of 12 results made the distance of the Mount Gun from the station 29547 feet; and the mean of 6 results, gave the distance of the Fort Gun from the station 13932.3 feet. The map† will show the exact relative positions and distances of the points, and the face of the country over which the sound travelled.

* I have not given the details of the survey, as that would swell the Paper to an inconvenient size: the base, however, was measured with great care twice, and generally six observations were taken for finding each angle, each observation differing very little from the other.

† The angles and distances were protracted, and the map of the intermediate country filled up from the best surveys, under the superintendance of E. Lake, Esq. of the Madras Engineers, my son-in-law.
We see, as I before remarked, that the distance of one gun from the station is nearly double that of the other, and this will be found an advantage, in showing whether sound travels equally during its progress.

The experiments are given in the subjoined Tables.

Table I. Contains the experiments of each day with the Mount gun, together with the state of the atmosphere and the direction of the wind at the time of observation: the titles at the heads of the columns render a particular explanation unnecessary—the number of observers is stated in the third column, and the mean of their observations in the ninth.

Table II. Contains the mean of observations of each day, when the air was calm.

Table III. The mean of observations of three days, when the wind was in the S. E. quarter.

Table IV. The mean of observations of three days, when the wind was in the N. E. quarter.

Table V. The mean of observations of three days, when the wind was S.W. by W. or N.W.

Table VI. The experiments with the Fort gun, arranged as those in Table I., with the Mount gun.

Tables VII., VIII., IX., and X. The experiments with the Fort gun arranged according to the state of the wind, as in the former Tables of experiments with the Mount gun.

Table XI. Shows the mean motion of sound for each month at the Madras Observatory, as found by the experiments, at the mean height of the thermometer, barometer, and hygrometer, given in the table.

Upon a cursory inspection of Tables I. and IV., it will be seen that the motion of sound varies under different states of
the atmosphere and weather: that according to the first table, sound at one time has been as long as 27.6 seconds in travelling from the Mount to the Observatory station; and at another time only 24.8 seconds; the distance being 29547 feet. In the first case, therefore, the velocity of sound was only about 1078 feet in a second; while in the other, its velocity was nearly $1191\frac{1}{2}$ feet. The extremes in Table VI., show a still greater difference. This proves the necessity for making experiments during a long interval, in order to obtain an accurate general result.

In Tables II. and VII. we find, as the thermometer rose, the atmosphere at the same time decreasing in density and increasing in its elasticity, that the sound moved with greater rapidity.

That with the wind in the SE. quarter the velocity was considerably increased, both from the Mount and Fort; more, however, in proportion, as might be expected, from the former than the latter.

That with the wind at NE. the sound from the Fort gun travelled with a greater, and from the Mount gun with a less velocity, than when the wind was in any other direction; that wind being favourable for increasing the velocity from the Fort, and unfavourable from the Mount: the full effect of the wind, however, is not to be ascertained by this table alone, as the thermometer during the time the NE. wind prevails is comparatively low, and the barometer high; both which, as will have been seen by inspection of the tables, occasion the sound to travel slower than ordinary.

The wind SW. W. and NW. the velocity from the Mount was accelerated, and that from the Fort retarded; but not in
the degree that would have taken place had the thermometer, barometer, and hygrometer, remained the same as in the NE. monsoon; but having been different, the velocity was accelerated from both guns on this account, in like manner as it was retarded in the NE. monsoon.

The following are the results deduced from the experiments in the different tables. I shall first give the general results from Table I. and VI.

| Mean height of Barom. | Thermometer. | Hygrometer. | Seconds. | Distance. | Velocity in a Second. |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Tab. I.               |              |             |          |           |                      |
| Inch.                 | 29,992       | 84°11       | 19       | 25,869    | 29,547               |
|                       |              |             |          |           | 1142,18              |

Or almost precisely the same as the velocity by the theory.

| Barometer. | Thermometer. | Hygrometer. | Seconds. | Distance. | Velocity in a Second. |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Tab. VI.   |              |             |          |           |                      |
| Inch.      | 30,065       | 80°47       | Dry.     | 11,4      | 12,306               |
|            |              |             |          |           | 13932,3              |
|            |              |             |          |           | 1132,14              |

Here we find a difference from the former general result by the observations with the Mount gun; the reason of which appears to be, that I could not, as I have before stated, carry on the observations during at least a complete revolution of the changes in the atmosphere; and that this is the reason I shall now endeavour to show. The interval wanting is between the 28th of March and the 16th of July. Had this interval been wanting in the experiments with the Mount gun, there would have been a difference of 0.237 seconds in the mean result; for the mean of the experiments in this
interval is $25&#x27;&#x27;$,632, and the mean of the whole $25&#x27;&#x27;$,869, making the difference just mentioned.

Now $25&#x27;&#x27;$,869 + $0&#x27;&#x27;$,287 = $26&#x27;&#x27;$,106, which would have been the mean number of seconds had the observations with the Mount gun been continued during the same interval only as the experiments with the Fort gun. Then $26&#x27;&#x27;$,106 : $0&#x27;&#x27;$,237 :: $12&#x27;&#x27;$,306 (the mean of the Fort observations) : $0&#x27;&#x27;$,112. Now $12&#x27;&#x27;$,306 - $0&#x27;&#x27;$,112 = $12&#x27;&#x27;$,194, which would have been the general mean of the experiments with the Fort gun, had the same been continued as long as the experiments with the Mount gun. Then the distance $13932$,3 feet, divided by $12$,194, will give $1142$,5 for the motion of sound by the experiments with the Fort gun thus brought on; and this also agrees, within a fraction of a foot, with the velocity according to Sir Isaac Newton; and with the results by the two other celebrated philosophers before named.

We then have by the Mount gun $1142$,18 for the velocity.

And by the Fort gun - - - $1142$,5.

The mean is $1142$,34, or very nearly the velocity above alluded to. Nothing could be more satisfactory than this general result;* and it may be presumed, that the other results in different states of the atmosphere are equally to be depended upon.

The velocity also by the Fort gun, which, it will be recollected, is little more than half the distance of the Mount gun from the station, shows that sound travels equally during its progress.

In the N.E. monsoon, the sound was very indistinct at times; this however does not appear to have sensibly affected

* The results by the Mount gun may however be taken as the standard.
its motion. The French academicians indeed proved, as I have mentioned before, that this made no difference in the velocity.

I shall now proceed to the conclusions from the other Tables; and first, those of the experiments with the Mount gun.

| Table     | Inches      |            |        |         |          |                     |

Secondly. The experiments with the Fort gun.

| Table | Barometer | Thermometer | Hygrometer | Wind   | Seconds | Distance | Velocity in a second |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| VII.  | 30,111    | 79, 3       | 11,85      | Calm   | 12,313  | 13932,3  | 1131,5              |
| VIII. | 30,023    | 82, 3       | 14, 6      | SE     | 12,231  |          | 1139,1              |
| IX.   | 30,131    | 78, 6       | 7,33       | NE     | 12,340  |          | 1129,0              |
| X.    | 29,979    | 81, 9       | 11,41      | SW.W.&amp;NW| 12, 46  |          | 1118,1              |

The results in these Tables, like the separate observations, show the necessity of making a series of experiments long continued, in order to obtain the correct general rate at which sound travels; and this may afford a clue, as I observed in the first part of this paper, for discovering the cause of the differences in the results by the authorities there named: it is difficult, undoubtedly, to ascertain the distance of two stations, one far from the other, to the nearest foot; but errors of many feet in this respect, would make but a small difference in the velocity in a second found by experiment, when
the gun and station were even at a moderate distance;* we must therefore be led to conclude, that these differences have chiefly arisen from the experiments having been made during a limited period only, and at unfavourable times for obtaining a mean result, instead of the interval which appears by these experiments to be necessary.

A particular examination of the Tables and results, will show the difficulty of ascertaining what proportion of the differences should be allowed to each of the instruments used for finding the state of atmosphere, exclusive of the effects of the wind.

During the calms, we might expect that the proportional parts to be allowed for the difference in the thermometer, barometer, and hygrometer, might be found with some degree of accuracy; the discrepancies, however, are very considerable. Comparing the results of Tables II. and VII. we find the barometer 0.121 lower, the thermometer 4°.6 higher, and the air about $8\frac{1}{2}$ more dry by the former Table than by the latter, while the velocity in a second is only 17.7 feet greater by one Table than the other.

We give however in addition the following results taken from the Tables of calms, and arranged according to the different heights of the thermometer and barometer. These results may assist us in coming to some conclusion upon this part of the subject.

* For example, a difference of about twenty-six feet in the distance, between the Observatory station and the Mount gun, would make only about a foot difference in the velocity in a second.
*Experiments with the Mount gun.*

Where the changes are so numerous and so frequent as in the atmosphere of the earth, we cannot expect that our imperfect instruments will be of a construction sufficiently delicate to show accurately every alteration that may affect the motion of the pulses of the air; but by various comparisons and combinations of the results, we may hope to arrive at general conclusions, somewhat approaching the truth.

Now, by numerous combinations of the observations just given, when the air was calm, we are led to conclude: first,

* These are deduced from 100 observations.
that for each degree of the thermometer 1,2 feet may be allowed in the velocity of sound for a second; for each degree of the hygrometer 1,4; and for one-tenth of an inch of the barometer* 9,2 feet. Then taking these numbers as the basis of the comparison, we find the mean difference of the velocity between a calm, and in a moderate breeze of wind, to be nearly 10 feet in a second. And by comparing other results together, a difference of about $21\frac{1}{4}$ feet in a second, or 1275 in a minute is found between, the wind being in the direction of the motion of sound, or opposed to it.

Before I conclude these introductory observations, and explanations of the experiments, it may be proper to refer more particularly to Table XI., containing the mean motion of sound for each month of the year, by the experiments with the Mount gun, according to the state of the atmosphere indicated by the different instruments; and to the prevailing monsoons, which may be considered to be the same, during the same months, every year; full information respecting which is given in the former Tables. On examining this Table, it is rather curious to observe how regularly the mean velocity proceeds to a maximum about the middle of the year, and afterwards retraces its steps; giving us a velocity in one case 1164 feet in a second, and in the other of only 1099 feet. This regularity would, no doubt, be still greater with the mean of the observations of several years.

* The rise and fall of the barometer is very limited in this country, as will be seen by an examination of the Tables. A sudden fall of 0,3 inch indicates a gale of wind.
