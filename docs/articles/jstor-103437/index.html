GIVING SOME ACCOUNT OF THE Present Undertakings, Studies and Labours OF THE INGENIOUS, IN MANY Considerable Parts of the World.

VOL. XXXIV. For the Year 1726, and Jan. Febr. March, April, May and June 1727.

LONDON,
Printed for W. and J. Innys, Printers to the Royal Society, at the West End of St. Paul&#x27;s. 1728.
To
Martin Folkes, Esq;
Vice-President of the Royal Society.

Honoured Sir,

I shall not, I presume, need any other Apology for prefixing your Name to this Thirty Fourth Volume of Philosophical Transactions, when I declare, that the Motive of my doing so was the same, which induc&#x27;d the greatest Man that ever liv&#x27;d, to single you out to fill his Chair, and to preside in the Assemblies of the Royal Society, when the frequent Returns of his Indisposition would no longer permit him to attend them with his usual Assiduity.

This Motive, Sir, we all know, was your uncommon Love to, and your singular Attainments in those noble and manly Sciences, to which the Glory of Sir Isaac Newton, and the Reputation of the Royal Society is solely and entirely owing.

That Great Man was sensible, that something more than knowing the Name, the Shape and obvious Qualities of an Insect, a Pebble, a Plant, or a Shell, was requisite to form a Philosopher, even of the lowest rank, much more to qualify one to sit at the Head of so great and learned a Body. We all of us remember that Saying so frequently in his Mouth, That Natural History might indeed furnish Materials
The DEDICATION.

vials for Natural Philosophy; but, however, Natural History was not Natural Philosophy; and it was easy for all his Friends to see, with what intent he so often us&#x27;d this remarkable Expression. We knew his Love to the Royal Society, and his Fears for it. It was not that he despis&#x27;d so useful a Branch of Learning as Natural History; he was too wise to do so: But still he judg&#x27;d that this humble Handmaid to Philosophy, tho&#x27; she might be well employ&#x27;d in amassing Implements and Materials for the Service of her Mistress, yet must very much forget her self, and the Meanness of her Station, if ever she should presume to claim the Throne, and arrogate to her self the Title of the Queen of Sciences.

These, Sir, were the Sentiments of that Illustrious Philosopher, and his Authority alone would weigh a great deal with you, if the Solidity of your own Judgment did not convince you of the Truth of them. But I shall not offer here to draw your Character: It is sufficient to say, that Mr. Folkes was Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Friend. However, while I avoid being troublesome to your Modesty, I beg leave to indulge my own Vanity thus far, to endeavour by this publick Application to perpetuate the Memory of that sincere and constant Friendship, which has now so many Years subsisted between you and me, who am, with the highest Esteem and Respect, Sir,

Your most Obliged and most Faithful Servant,

J. JURIN, R.S., Secr.
