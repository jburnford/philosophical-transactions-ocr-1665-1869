<div class="ocr-text">Two Minutes, gently shooting withal to the North-east, till it arose to about 45 Degrees; then suddenly quitting its Tail, which vanished, colouring the neighbouring Clouds with a Yellow on their Separation, it formed itself first into a Ball of Fire; then shooting quickly to the South-east in a Stream of Light, disappeared, making a Noise like a Clap of Thunder at some Distance, and leaving behind it a smoaky Substance in its Tract.

The Weather moderate and cloudy, Wind, as nigh as I can remember, West South-west. It continued in Sight upwards of Five Minutes.

III. Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Mr. William Gostling to Peter Collinson, F.R.S. concerning the Fire-ball seen Dec. 11. last, and the Mock-Suns seen the 19th of the same Month.

My good Friend,

Canterbury, Mar. 9. 1741-2.

As the Fire-ball appeared at Noon-day, and the Sun shining, few People saw it, and they could only guess at the Course.
Course. The best Account I have had is at Second-hand, from two Farmers who saw it together, and make its Course from North-west by North to South-east by South, and right over Littleborn (which is the first Village in the Road from hence to Deal). Their way of telling its Course was by saying, it went from Westbere toward Ratling, near which Place Lord Cowper was then hunting, and heard but one Explosion, which seemed to be within a few Rods of him: The other, I suppose, happened at such a Distance, as to be in one with that so near him.

I have inclosed a Sketch of an Appearance we had eight Days after the Ball, viz. Dec. 19. of which, I believe, the Duration was uncommon, from Sun-rise to Noon *.

I remember Dampier mentions Haloes as presaging Storms, and this Combination of them has been succeeded by a long Season of stormy Weather. I am

Your obliged Friend and Servant,

William Gostling.

* The Representation of it was exactly the same as that at p. 47. of No 462. except that the Light at c, expressed in that, was omitted in this.</div>
