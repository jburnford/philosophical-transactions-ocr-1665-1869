Each Cornea seemed to have its Iris, (or Rain-bow-like Circle) and Apertures or Pupils distinct; and upon opening the Cornea, there was found within it two Balls, or Crystalline Humours, very well shaped; but the other parts of it could not be so well distinguished, because the eye had been much bruised by the handling, and the inner parts confused and dislocated. It had four Eye-browes, placed in the manner express&#x27;d in Figure 4. by \(a\), \(b\); \(a\) representing the lower, and \(b\), the upper Eyelids.

Lastly, That just above the Eyes, as it were in the midst of the Forehead, was a very deep depression, and out of the midst of that grew a kind of double Purse or Bag, \(C\), containing little or nothing in it; but to some it seemed to be a production of the matter designed for the Nose, but diverted by this Monstrous Conception; perhaps the Processus mammillares joined into one, and covered with a thin hairy skin.

Observables in the Body of the Earl of Balcarres.

These following Observations, were a while since sent out of Scotland by an ingenious person, an Eye-witness, to Sir Robert Moray,

1. That the Belly of this Nobleman being opened, the Omentum or Net was found lean and small: his Liver very bigg; the Spleen bigg also, filled with a black and thick humour. His Stomach and Entrails all empty, of a Saffron-colour, distended with wind only. The Bladder of Gall swelled with a black humour: the Kidneys filled with a kind of grumous blood.

2. That in the Thorax or Chest, the Lobes of the Lungs were all entire, but of a bad colour; on the left side somewhat black and blue, and on the right, whitish; with a yellowish knob under one of the Lobes.

3. That
3. That the Pericardium or the Case of the Heart being opened, there appeared none of that water, in which the Heart uses to swim; and the external Surface of it, from the Base to the Tip, was not smooth, but very rough. It being cut asunder, a quantity of white and insipid liquor run out, and beneath the Base, between the right and left Ventricle, two stones were found, whereof the one was as bigg as an Almond, the other, two Inches long and one broad, having three Auricles or crisped Angles: And in the Orifice of the right Ventricle, there was a fleshy fattish Matter.

4. That the whole Body was bloodless, thin, and emaciated, of a black and bluish Colour.

5. The Scull being opened, both the Cerebrum and Cerebellum were bigg in proportion to the Body; and out of it run much more Blood, than was seen in both the other Regions together.

Of the designed Progress to be made in the Breeding of Silkworms, and the Making of Silk, in France.

The French King Henry the Fourth, having made a general Establishment all over France, of planting and propagating of Mulberry-trees, and Breeding of Silkworms, in order to set up and entertain a Silk trade there; and having prospered so well in that Design, that in many parts of his Dominions great store of such Trees were raised, and Multitudes of Silk-works propagated, to the great benefit of the French people, forasmuch as it was a considerable beginning to avoid the transport of several Millions abroad for buying of Silks, and withall an excellent means of well-employing abundance of poor Orphans and Widows, and many old, lame, and other indigent and helpless people; The present French King, hath lately revived and seconded that Undertaking, by giving express order, that it should be promoted by all possible means, and particularly in the Metropolis of that Kingdom, and round about it; and that for that end the whole way concerning that Work and Trade</div>
