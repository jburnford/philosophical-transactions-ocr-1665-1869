TO

MARTIN FOLKES, Esq;
PRESIDENT
Of the Royal Society of London,
For improving Natural Knowledge,
And Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences
at PARIS, &amp;c.

SIR,

THOUGH the Royal Society heard
with the greatest Concern the Resolution
taken by their late worthy President, to decline
being any longer chosen into that Office: As they
were truly sensible of the many Services he had
done them, and still gratefully acknowledge the
Continuance of his Favours: Their Loss was im-
mediately made up, and all their Apprehensions
removed upon your Acceptance of that Post, in
which you have shewn the Society, that you
make their Welfare and Prosperity the Object of
your constant Care and Application. The great
Pains you have taken to inlarge their Correspon-
dence both at Home and Abroad, the generous
Encouragement you have given to Persons en-
gaged in all the several Branches of useful Know-
lege
lege to bring in their Discoveries, the Part you have borne yourself by imparting curious and useful Papers, and the constant Care you are pleased to take of all their Affairs; are the most convincing Proofs of your Zeal and Affection for the Royal Society, and of their Happiness, in having made Choice of a Person in all Respects so qualified to fill their Chair; whereby they have the Satisfaction of seeing themselves flourish more and more, and Arts and Sciences continually encouraged, under the Protection of a Gentleman universally acquainted with all the Branches of Learning, which are the Objects of their Pursuits and Inquiries. Give me Leave, Sir, to make this public Acknowledgement, and at the same time to record my own Gratitude for the many Favours and Instances of Friendship you have conferred upon,

Honoured SIR,

Your most obedient and Most humble Servant,

Cromwell Mortimer, M.D.

Secretary to the Royal Society, and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.
