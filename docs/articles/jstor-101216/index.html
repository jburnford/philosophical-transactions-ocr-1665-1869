<div class="ocr-text">Storm of Hail about the Coast-Towns of Suffolk, tracing along Seckford-Hall, Wood-bridge, Snape bridge, Aldborough, &amp;c. more to the North-ward. The Hail was small near Yarmouth; but at Seckford-Hall, one Hail-stone was found by measure to be 9. Inches about. One of this Town (viz. Wood bridge) found one at Melton, 8. Inches about. At Snape-bridge a man affirm&#x27;d, that he lighted on one about 12. Inches about. A Lady of Friston-Hall, putting one of them into a Ballance, found it weigh 12 s. 6 d. Several persons of good credit in Aldborough affirm&#x27;d, some Hail-stones to have been full as bigg as Turkeys-Eggs; (an ordinary Hens Egg weighs but about 9 s.) J. Baker of Rumborough, driving a Cart on the Heath by Aldborough, had his head broken by the knocks of them through a stiff Country-felt: In some places his head bled; in others, bunnyes arose: The Horses were so pelted, that they hurried away his Cart beyond all command. They seem&#x27;d all white, smooth without, shining within. &#x27;Tis somewhat strange, methinks, that their pillar of Air should keep them aloft, if they were not clapt together in the falling; especially at such a time of the year, when the Air is less thickned and its Spring weaker.

Account of a great number of Stones, found in one Bladder, by the same.

Mr. Goodrick Chirurgeon of Bury St. Edmunds affirm&#x27;d to me, that himself Cutting a Lad of the Stone (for which he hath a great name) took out thence, at one time, 96 small Stones, all of them of unlike shape, Size, Corners, Sides; some of which were so be-stow&#x27;d as to slide upon others, and had thereby worn their flats to a wonderfull slickness. He assur&#x27;d me also, that in the same place, another, when dead, had a Stone taken from him, almost as big as a new-born Childs head, and much of that Shape.

The Description of a Well, and Earth in Lanchashire, taking Fire by a Candle approached to it.

This was imparted by that Ingenious and Worthy Gentleman, Thomas Shirley Esq; an Eye-witness of the thing, now to be related in his own words; viz.

About the later end of February 1659. returning from a Journey to my house in Wigan, I was entertained with the relation of an odd Spring, situated in one Mr. Hawkley&#x27;s Ground (if I mi-</div>
