<div class="ocr-text">XLI. Observations of Immersions and Emerisions of Jupiter&#x27;s first Satellite, made at Funchal, in Madeira, with a reflecting Telescope of 18 Inches Focus, made by Mr. Short. The Time was found by taking equal Altitudes, with a Quadrant of 12 Inches radius, made by Mr. Bird, and with the help of a good Pendulum Clock made in London. By the late Thomas Heberden, M.D. F.R.S.

Read Dec. 13, 1770.

The latitude of the place of observation in Funchal, by a mean of several observations made with the same quadrant = 32° 33&#x27; 35&quot;.
