<div class="ocr-text">VI. Observations on the Class of Sweet Tastes, made by comparing the Tastes of Sweet Plants with Monsieur L&#x27;Emery&#x27;s Chymical Analysis of them, in his Treatise of Drugs, by Sir John Floyer.

I observe that by our Taste we may discern all the Chymical Principles in Plants before their distillation, and that for want of a due observation of their Tastes, Mr L&#x27;Emery has not fully described the Chymical Principles which Plants do yield in Distillation.

All Watery Plants show their Phlegm as well to the Taste as in Distillation; and in all dry woody Tastes we observe the Earth, as well as we can by the Chymical Analysis.

By the Mucilage and Gummyness, or Oily Taste, we distinguish the Oyl of Plants, as well as by Distillation.

The Aromatical Smell shews us the volatility of the Oyl and Salt of Plants, and by the foetidness we also know that the Oyl and Salt are in a volatile state.

By the acrimony and pungency we know that there is a Volatile Salt in Plants, and by their burning taste we find there is a Corrosive Salt in them.

By a crude rough Acidity we observe the Tartar, or essential Salt of Plants; but if the Acidity be of a Vinous smell, we observe that &#x27;tis of middle state of Digestion, and
and may be called a Vinous Tartar, and the Crude Tartar an Acerb Tartar, but if the Tartar had a pungent smell, then &#x27;tis a Volatile Tartar, or Acid Acrid Tartar.

I will next describe the principles observable in Sweet Tastes, and their several Classes, but must first observe that Sweet Tastes shew their Oyl by their slimy smoothness, and their Tartar is evident in their extracts, as in the Juice of Liquorish.

1. The Grass sweetens *gramen caninum* have much essential Salt and moderate Oyl, *Juncus equisetum*, *arundo*, *typha*, *nymphaea*, are all of the Rush kind, sweet and rough, and some of them have more Oyl, others more Acid, and that the most crude have more Oyl than Tartar.

2. The Corn Sweets, as Barley, Rye, Wheat, Oats, Rice, Millet, have much Oyl and essential Salt, and a little Volatile: So Bread yields Oyl and Essential and Volatile Salt.

Note, that Fermentation or the Fire produces the Volatile Salt, by exalting the Tartar into a Volatile Salt; and the slimy mealiness in Corn supplies the Oyl. *Tragopogon* and *Scorzonera* are referable to the Grass, and contain much Oyl, and essential Salt.

3. The Subacrid Sweets, as *Rampions*, *campanula*, *trachelium*, contain much Oyl and essential Salt, but the Acrimony in these Plants shews a Volatile Salt not described by the Chymist.

4. The Ferns contain Oyl and Essential Salt, as Polypody; but the Acrid principle is not observed by the Chymist, nor the fragrancy in Harts Tongue. *Osmunda* and the *Capillaries* have more Oyl than Salt, because more mucilaginous and crude.

5. All the Leguminous slimy Sweets have more Oyl than Tartar, but all much of both, as Broom, *Ononis*, *Aquilegia*, *fumaria*, Asparagus, *ruscus*, *thalictrum*, *polygonatum*, *Senna*, *galega*, *lathyrus*, *luteola*, *periclymenum*, *glyciriza*, *psyllium*, much Oyl and Volatile or Essential Salt.

Beans
Beans and Peas and Lentils have also a Volatile Salt and *lens aquatica*. Note, that since there is no Acrimony in these Seeds, the Volatile Salt is produced by the Fire.

The Aromatic Legumens, as *Melilotus*, have an exalted Oyl, and essential Salt.

*Periclymenum* is described to have only essential Salt and Oyl, but since there is an Aromatic Odor in the flavour, and a great Acrimony, there must be some degree of Volatile Salt in it.

Fenagreke and Meadow Trefoyl have much Oyl and little Salt, and so has *Ophioglossum pinguiscula &amp; consolida regalis*.

6. The sweet Nuts, as Almonds, have much Oyl and essential Salt, but the bitter have more Salt than the sweet Almonds, therefore &#x27;tis probable that the Tartar abounds more in all bitters, and that Tartar is the effect of a higher digestion, and the crudest Tastes, as Styptics, Sweets and Slimes have least of it. So Chesnuts and Beech-nuts have much Oyl and little Salt. Filberds are described to have essential Salt, and a little Volatile as well as Oyl; but it seems no probability that one may have it, and none in any of the other.

7. The Sweet Acid or Vinous Tastes have much Oyl and essential Salt, as Prunes, Cherries, Strawberries; Raspberries. The variety of the Tastes of these Fruits shews the different digestions and mixtures, tho the principles are the same.

The Sweet Viscous Fruits, as Sebestens, have little essential Salt, and much Oyl.

8. The Sweet Aromatic Burning Tastes contain a Volatile Salt and Oyl, as *Schenanthus*, Ginger, *Zed-Oary*, Cubebs, Cardamums, *Vaynillas*, *contrayerva calamus aromaticus*; but these following are mistaken by the Chymist, who say that *Costus amarus, dulcis, cyperus, galanga*. Orris, have a Volatile Oyl, but essential Salt only, for Orris is Acrid and Aromatic as well as the rest, and therefore there is both Volatile Salt and Oyl in them, and also an essential Salt from their sweetness.

9. The
9. The sweet Acrid Aromaticks of the Fænil Class have all a Volatile Salt and a Volatile Oyl, as Angelica, Lovage, Parsly, Meum, Dill. Note, The Leaves and Roots of Fænil contain a Volatile Oyl and Essential Salt, the Seed a Volatile Oyl and Salt; but since the Roots and Leaves have a pungent Taste, there is also a Volatile Salt in them, tho the Chymists do not observe it.

All the parts of Carraways have the odor of Punaifes, except the Seed; from whence I may infer, that the foetid Plants have the same principles as the Aromatics, viz. a Volatile Oyl and Salt; and this is confirmed by other foetids which have them, as Rue and Affa fætida, and Vulvaria. Peucedanum is described for a bitter acid Taste, with the odor of Pitch, and must have a Volatile Salt, tho L&#x27; Emery describes only its essential Salt and Oyl: So in Smallage he describes only the essential Salt and Oyl, but its Acrid Taste manifests the Volatile Salt.

10. The Sweet Gums, as Manna, Sarcocolla, contain much Oyl and essential Salt; tho Honey and Sugar have more essential Salt than Oyl; by which we may observe how much essential Salt is in all Sweets, and why they are apt to turn sour, and ferment; and from such sweet Gums all sweet Plants have their Acid and Oyl upon Distillation.

11. Citrulls, Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, which are bitter Sweets, and very mucilaginous, contain much Oyl and little Salt.

Since the whole Classes of Sweet Plants contain an Oyl and Essential Salt, some more some less of both, the Vertues of the several sweet Tastes can never be explained by the Chymical Principles, and no new Virtues by them is discovered; therefore all the advantage we have obtained by these Chymical Distillations is only to show the nature of Sweetness in general, by discovering the principles contained in sweet Plants, and this is a greater advantage to Natural Philosophy than to Physick, to which the tasting of Plants is more useful.

By the Taste we distinguish the Sweets into their several Classes, and we discern tempers and digestion, and mixture of their principles, and hence easily guess at their effects in Animals, and by the Taste we distinguish the different state of both the Oyl and Acid in Plants of different sweet Tastes; whereas the Chymists observe no difference of the Tartar Acid, whether it be Acerb, or Vinous, or Volatile; nor of the sweet Oyls from the bitter and slimy.
By the Taste we distinguish the Acrif and the Acid Salts, which mix in distillation; and they are not well distinguished by the Chymifts.

By the Taste we discern when the Fire makes new products and mixtures, not naturally found in Plants; for in Corn, Beans, Peas, Bread, Fire produces a Volatile Salt not observable in them before: And a Volatile Salt is drawn from the Ices of Wine by the Fire; and Leven yields also a Volatile Salt; whereas before in Corn only an Oyl and Acid were observed; and &#x27;tis probable that the Tarrar is Volatilized, both by the Fermentation and the Fire.

Coffee is a Bean by its Taste and Cods, and acquires a Volatile Salt by roasting; but L&#x27;Emery only mentions its Oyl and fixed Salt upon Distillation, but the fixed Salt is the effect of Fire, and its virtue depends on the Volatile.

No more Chymiftry is necessary for the discovery of the Physical Vertues of Plants, than to make Decoctions of them in fair Water, and to observe the Tastes and other sensible qualities of those Decoctions, and from them to take the natural hints for the trial of their Vertues on Animal Bodies. I will confine myself to the Clafs of Sweet Tastes, and give an account of several Decoctions made in all the species of sweet Plants, and add some Tastes I had not formerly described fully, and such reasons as induced me to place them in the Clafs of Sweet Plants.

I hope these objections against Decoctions, that the Volatile parts expire, and the mucilage dissolving in the Water obscures the Taste: I therefore do confess, that Plants are best tasted in their natural state to discover all their Vertues, but these Decoctions do help to confirm our Tastes, and discover the great variety of Medicines which may be made from Sweet Tastes. Note, that all Decoctions must be tasted cold.

A Description of the Tastes and other sensible qualities in the Decoctions of Plants of the Sweet clas.

1. The Grass Sweets, under which are contained all sorts of Grasses and Rushes, Reeds and Corn; I refer Nymphea Alba to the Rushes, both for its figure and taste, which is crude and styptic, with a bitterishness in the Seed; but the flowers are like Lillies of a sweet smell, and mucilaginous, sweet, styptic in Taste.
I boiled Horse-tail a handful in a pint of Water, and I found the Decoction to taste very Styptic with a bitterishness, and the Decoction looked like Small Beer, the Taste being like Rushes: I concluded it to be of the same Class. The Styptic Virtue is useful for all Fluxes.

Plantago aquatica boiled in Water gave a Caustic Acrid Taste, joined with a crude rush Taste; the Decoction was greenish and pale. This Caustic Acrimony is useful in the Scurvy and Dropsy. It is aranunculus, by its capitula echinata, as well as by its Acrimony.

Nymphaea lutea has a sweet Astringent lustre in the Flowers, with an Acrid smell like Creepers.

A Reed is of a sweet bitter and mucilaginous Taste, it abstersges by the bitter without Acrimony, and cools by the Mucilage Sub-acrid Styptic, by which tis a Rush.

Sagittara is Sweet, Subacrid and Styptic, by which it is a Rush.

Alga Marina is Subacrid and Sweet, and something Styptic.

Fucus is of a sweet, Saltish Taste.

The Palm-Tree is Sweet and Styptic, and because of this Taste and its folia arunlinacea, I refer it to the sweet Styptic; a sweet Vinous Juice flows from its Bark being wounded, the Immature Fruit is very Styptic, but the mature Sweet, viscid, vinous, and subastringent, proper for Fluxes.

Wine, Vinegar and Sugar are made from the sweet Juice.

The Inspissate juice of the Palm Tree is the Terra Japonica; whose substance is gummoso, and of a bitterish Styptic Taste, and also of a sweet Taste, and of a grateful odor. Boyl 3l of Terra Japanica in 1b of Water, and sweeten it for a Cough or Looseness.

Leven is observed by Aetius to be cool by its acidity, to be hot being putrid, and also to have some Virtue from the Salt and Flower. He observes that Beer is hotter than Barley, and because of its putrefaction &#x27;tis of an ill juice; and he also observes, its Windiness depends on the Air included in it; and the Waterish Beer and the Acid is cooling.

All these Virtues were discovered by the sensible qualities of Leven and Beer, without Chymistry. And we may observe that what we call Fermentation in them, was called by Aetius a Putrefaction. We have rectified the notion, and given it a new name, but the Antients knew the nature and effects of Fermentation as well as the Moderns; and &#x27;tis that which gives the different states of the principles in Plants, and the several states are best discovered by our Tastes and Senses.
I boyled Gramen spica secalina, and the Decoction was of a sweet, mucilaginous and styptic Taste.

The Roots of Grass have something of Acrimony and Astringent, but the Decoction tastes smooth and sweetish. The green Leaves of Grass are sweet and styptic. The Decoction of the Water was of a pale colour.

The Seeds of Grass are more diuretic and binding, I made a Decoction of them, which resembled Water-gruel.

Paronychia foliis rutaceis must be referred to the Grasses, because of its sweetness.

2. Quere whether Rapunculus be not of the Sweet Class, because the whole Plant is Sweet and Milky, and for that both are given to Nurses to increase Milk. The Roots of the rampions are something styptic and cooling, and proper against Inflammations.

Scorzonera and Tragopogon are referable to the Grasses, because of their geniculate Stalks, their Grassly Leaves, sweet Tastes and Milky Juice, the Decoction was smooth and of a pale colour.

Trachelium is also Sweet, Milky, Subacid, and Bitterish, of the same class.

3. The sweet mucilaginous and crude Lychnis, the decoction of Alfine, is sweetish and mucilaginous, the colour pale like Small Beer. I could observe no astringency in Alfine. I boyled 3j in a pint of Water, it hath a cooling and moistening quality like common Lychnis. Dioscorides says, Chickweed being bruised has the smell of a Cucumber.

All the common Lychnis&#x27;s are bitter sweets, and them I shall refer to the class of Bitters, tho their jointed Stalks and Sweetness may justly place them here, yet their chief Physical Virtue is from their Bitterness.

4. The Sweet Bitterish Styptic, and Subacid Fern.

I boyled 3j of Fern Roots in 1b of Water to half, the Taste was very Styptic and Bitterish, the Colour Citron.

The Mucilage and Stypticity make Fern an excellent Vulnerary, and Styptic in all Fluxes: the young Buds rubbed in the Fingers swell something like a Kernel, or the Laurel smell.

Dryopteris is described Astringent and Sweet, Acid and Bitterish.

Hemionitis has both Astringency and Bitterness.

Adiantum album &amp; nigrum are Sweet and Styptic, and since Experience shews these to be good Pectorals, the other Ferns have the same Pectoral Virtue, as Vulneraries.

Herniaria is described as a Styptic.
In *Adianthum* there is something odorate. *L&#x27;Emery.*

Polypody is Bitterish, Sweet and Astringent, Nauseous and Sub-acrid and Slimy, it purges by this Taste both Choler and Flegm.

I boiled Harts Tongue 3l in 1tj of Water to half; it was of the colour of Small Beer; the Taste was Mucilaginous, Sweet, Styptic, with an Aromatic flavor of Raspberries or Orris, which is its Cordial Virtue, joined with Stypticity and Mucilage, by which &#x27;tis proper for hot Hypochondriacs.

The Roots of *Osmunda* are of a Subacrid and Bitterish Taste, besides the Astringency, by which they open, but the Astringency much hinders that effect.

5. The Sweet, Acrid, Aromatics and Foetids, the Roots have more Sweetness and Aromatic Acrimony than the Leaves, which are more crude; the Seeds have most Aromatic Acrimony.

The Seeds of *Siler montanum* have an ungrateful smell like Cummin, and a Bitterish Taste.

*Peucedanum* is Bitter and Sweet. The Green Leaves of Coriander are foetid like *Punaises*.

*Laepitium* is Acrid, Aromatic in Smell, and of a Sweet, Acrid, Aromatic Taste.

*Sampire* is of an Acrid Aromatic Taste, and the Smell of Smallage.

*Cumin* is Acrid, Aromatic and Bitterish, and of a disagreeable Smell.

*Dracumulus Hortensis* is sweet like Anis.

*Ferula* has an ungrateful Aromatic Odor.

The Seed of *Meum* is bitter.

*Cachrys* is Bitter, Acrid, Aromatic.

*Cancalis* and *Daucus* agree in Virtue and Taste.

*Saxifragia pratinis* has a great Root, Sweet and Acrid; the Leaves are most Aromatic, and the Seeds; it resembles the Taste of Parsly.

The Leaves of *Gingidium* are of a disagreeable strong smell, and the Roots bitter.

*Tordylium* is Sweet, Aromatic, *gravi odore*.

*Pericpier* is like Chervil, and so is *Peeten Veneris*.

I refer the Umbells to the Grasses, because of their Sweetness and Joyned Stalks. Our Botanists have omitted the sweet Taste in some of them, which are bitter. Most of them are of an Aromatic Smell and Taste, but some are foetid, virole and fervid in their Taste.
Smyrnium Root has the smell of Myrrh, with a Bitter Acrid Taste, and it helps the Urine and the Menses like it.

The colour of the Specifick Juice is varicus: Thysselinum and Seseli praterse have a Milk: The Ferula&#x27;s are Milky, or have a Saffron colour: Their Juices make Sagapenum and Galbanum.

The Juice of the Root of Peucedanum is reddish, and is called Opoponax odor piceo vinjo.

The Root of Syphondylium has a Saffron coloured Juice, of a foetid and bitterish Taste.

Tis observed that some Seeds grow bitter by the fault of the soil in which they grow. All of this class have a Volatile Oil and Acrid Salt, by which they are diuretic, carminative, and pectoral, also by their sweetness, Emmenagogue, if foetid.

I boiled Parsley Roots 3j in 1b of Water, to half, the Taste was Sweet, and Acrid, Aromatic, the Colour pale.

The Roots of Meum are Acrid, and smell strong; too much of it offends the Head.

Libanotis has the smell and taste of the Seed of Angelica.

Sium or Apium palustre fol. Oblongis has an odor of Bitumen on all the Plant.

Thyselinum is Bitter, Ingrate and Acrid.

The Decoction of Angelica Roots are bitterish, Aromatic, Acrid, and of a yellowish Colour.

Imperatoria Roots decocted smelled like Angelica, and tasted very Bitter and Acrid; of a green Colour.

6. The Sweet, Acrid, Terebinthinate and Styptic.

Calamus, Nardus, Cyperus, agree in their Diuretic, Carminative and Emmenagogue Virtue, and their Stypticity, &amp;c.

Calamus resembles a Reed; it is an Acorus, the Taste resembles the Turpentine Plants, as well as its Cones.

Juncus odoratus is a Rush, with the smell of a Rose, when rubbed of a Burning, Acrid, Aromatic and Bitterish Taste.

Cyperus is of a pleasant Odor, like Lign. Aloes whilst it flowers, and of an Acrid, Aromatic, Bitterish, Styptic Taste.

Nardus resembles the flavor of Cyperus; &#x27;tis Bitterish, Astringent, Acrid and Aromatic.

The Roots of Cyperus are used for Nardus.

There is some factor in Valerian, Asarum, Serpentaria, whose Roots have a little Sweetness, with a Terebinthinate Bitter Acrid, and all of them resemble Spikenard odoris gravitate, and have the same Diuretic, Carminative, Emmenagogue Vertue, and are proper for Malignant Fevers; and a little Styptic.
The Red Valerian has a crude Taste in the Stalks and Leaves, the Flowers rubbed smell like Turpentine; the Leaves smell nauseous, foetid; the Roots agree with Spikenard. *Spica Celtica* and the Flowers of Valerian agree well.

The Leaves of Wild Valerian boiled in Water yield a crude and foetid Mucilage.

The Tincture of the Roots of Valerian, extracted with Spirit of Wine and Sal Armoniac, fines it much.

The Roots of Asarum are Geniculate as Grasses, and taste very Acrid, Aromatic and Bitterish; &#x27;tis called *Sylvestre Nardum*, and for its similitude referrible to it. The Antients attributed the same Virtue to *Asarum* as to *Acorus*, but more intense and strong.

Galen observed that *Phu* was an Odorate Root, like *Nardum* in virtue.

Pliny observed that Cyperus was a *Gladiolus bulbosa radice*, and like the Odor of *Nardum*.

The Decoction of *Ascarum* was greenish, with a strong smell of Spikenard, and Bitterish Acrid.

The Decoction of Valerian Roots of the same Taste, but pale colour, and smell of Spikenard, but weaker; they seem to be of the same Class.

7. The Sweet, Fervid Acrid, Bitterish, and Aromatic like Orris in Taste.

The Roots of Orris are Geniculate like Grass.

The Florentine Roots are bitterish and sweet, and of a burning Taste.

The Water Flag is burning and styptic, but of no smell; the Flowers of common Orris have an ill smell, tho the Roots be Aromatic. The whole Herb smells like Elder whilst &#x27;tis fresh bruised, but when dry &#x27;tis Odorate; it gives a Rasberry Taste to Drinks, and purges.

The great Galangal is Aromatic, Acrid, Burning and Bitterish; the Roots also geniculate, odorate; in form like Cyperus.

The Roots of *Acorus* are geniculate, acrid, burning, bitterish and aromatic; it resembles Orris both in Leaves and Roots.

Ginger is acrid, burning and aromatic like Pepper; the Leaves are like *Iris Palustris*.

Zedoary smells like Camphire, and is of a strong Taste, rather than sweet, &#x27;tis very bitter, and less acrid; but resembles Ginger.

*Coffus* is very burning, acrid and aromatic, and bitterish; it agrees with the virtue of Orris, both in its discussing quality and deobstructing.
Costus Dulcis has a sweet Taste, and acrid; but the bitter has an ungrateful kind of Taste; but there is but one species of Costus, the fresh is sweet and white, the old is bitter and blackish.

Gladiolus has a bulbous Root, sweet, and moderately acrid or burning; and the Leaves are like Orris.

Xyrs is of an ungrateful foetid odor, like Cimices; in form and figure like Orris.

Costus Arabicus is acrid, bitter and aromatic in Taste.

The Roots of Contrayerva smell like Fig-leaves, are like Orris Roots in figure, they being chewed; taste sweet, aromatic and acrid, and have also an astringent Taste.

Cardamomum has the Stalk and Leaves of a Reed, the Seeds in pods of a burning, acrid, bitterish, aromatic Taste.

Amomum by its external figure and virtue agrees with Cardamomum; some reckon it like Acorus.

Grana Paradisi are of a foetid and aromatic Taste, betwixt Cardamums and Pepper, and agrees with the same in virtue in Paralytic cases.

The Grains of Paradice infused in Wine gives the odor of Quinces.

Salmon.

The Roots of our yellow Flag are large and reddish; our Countrymen scrape them and pound them, then mix them with Milk, and give them twice to a Dog, as an infallible Medicine against the bite of a Mad Dog. A person who took them told me they did not purge, but tasted very rough: The Decoction is of a reddish colour, and rough.

8. The Sweet Mucilaginous Pea tastes, or Legumens.

I boiled Vicia 3j in 1b of Water to 1b, which tasted sweet and crude styptic, the colour was pale and greenish.

I boiled Lens Palustris in the same manner, and found the Decoction of a turbid colour, and reddish like Mum; it is a Legumen by this Intense Colour, as well as by the Taste, which was Sweetish, Subacrid and Styptic. Note, that Snails and other Insects are usually mixt with it.

I boiled Lagopus in the same quantity as the other; the Taste of the Decoction was styptic, crude and bituminous.

The Cortex Lentium is styptic and binding; the Seed of it mucilaginous and loosening; and this breeds an ill, flatulent and crude Juice, obstructing the circulation of the Blood and Spirits, injurious to the Sight and Menstrues; and by their flatulency producing turbulent Dreams.
The Leaves of Liquorish feel gummoso, the Roots are sweet and subacrid.

Tamarinds are of an acid, acrid and sweet mucilaginous Taste; the Stones have the figure of Lupins, the Leaves of Tamarinds; are of an acid agreeable Taste; and they must be referred to the Services and Berries, tho by the Cods and Seeds I erroneously have clas&#x27;d them with Cassia or Lupins.

Fumaterry is subacrid, bitterish, mucilaginous, and legumen, tho the Flowers be not.

Radix Cava has bitter-sweet Roots like Beans, and a mealy sub-acrid Taste; the Leaves have a crude smell like Fumiterry, and of the same virtue.

The Skin of the Bean is styptic, but the fleshy part bitterish leguminous.

Coffee is bitterish and of the Bean kind, in which there is a Volatile Salt, which raises the Spirits, and produces Urine and the Menses.

Orobus is of an ingrateful bitterish Taste; all the bitter Legumes open obstructions and promote Urine, as Kidney Beans, &amp;c.

I boiled Broom 3j in Water 1b to 1b, the Taste was moderately bitter, sweet and styptic, not nauseous, and without any heat.

I boiled of Genista Spinosa rootes 3j in 1b of Water to 1b, the Colour was like Small Beer, the Taste mucilaginous, styptic, without any great bitterness or acrimony; the Root tastes bitterish, mucilaginous, styptic; it may be proper for the Stone by those Tastes, and for Fluxes.

The Leaves of Bruscus have the smell of Broom when bruised, and its bitterness and stypticity and sweetness, and are subacrid; and by this Taste a Legumen.

Crato describes Sena as if it had Viscidum quid, by which it gripes; and by the Taste he discovered the bitterness and astriction. Matthiolus observed its viscous Taste and bitterness, with a viscid nauseous odor, like Cynoglosse or Punica. The filia, as well as the sweet taste and flowers, prove it a legumen.

Polygala boiled with the Blue Flowers gave a Colour Blue like Violets, and the Taste was very mucilaginous, the Plant is aromatic, acrid.

3j of Violatri Color boiled in 1b of Water to half, made a Decoction of a Greenish Colour, like Cowslip Wine, and it tasted gratefully and mucilaginous; the Roots of Polygala are acrid and aromatic; it purges Bile.

The Decoction of the Root of Periclymenum is styptic and bitter, and of sweet leguminous Taste.
Purple Trefoyle is mucilaginous and styptic, by which it cools Feverish heats, and by its burning acrimony it expel the putrid particles in Pecticial Feavers and Fluxes.

The Leaves of Red Trefoyle rubbed smell acid, and the Flowers bruised smell like Woodbine. The Decoction of 3j in 1b of Water to half gave a Greenish Colour, pale; and the Taste was of a crude mucilaginous leguminous Taste, with an acrimony, by which &#x27;tis a great Diuretic and Ophthalmic.

The Decoction of Purple Trefoyle has a turbid Colour, and mucilaginous Taste.

The Leaves of Periclymenum are acid and acrid; the Flowers more sweet, the style is of a Bean Taste, and the Twigs of the same.

The Stamina have the Taste of the Flower, and their Heads are very acrid.

Trifolium Fraticans is Bacciferous, with a Blue Juice, and tho it wants Cods &#x27;tis a Legumen, as well as Periclymenum, which is bacciferous.

The Flowers of Alparagus are hexapetal, and of an Herbaceous color; the Seed is a Pea, without a Cod, the Root is of a sweet glutinous acrid Taste; the tops of it boyled resemble Peas Pottage, and are evidently of a Leguminous Taste.

In the Legumens these are irregular, in Flowers or Cods, they are notwithstanding certainly of that Clas; by which we may infer, that the Taste gives the most certain character of a Clas.
