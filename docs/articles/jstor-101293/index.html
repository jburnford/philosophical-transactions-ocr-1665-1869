A Note.

Relating to the formerly publish&#x27;d Narrative about Empty Tubes, serving for a decay&#x27;d sight; imparted by the same Author in a Letter of August 10. 1668.

Sir, I pray you, give notice, That I have now tried Convexe Spectacles, which about 3 years agoe (before my sight fell into this decay) agreed very well for my use; and putting these Glasses
Glasses into the Tapers, I found the smallest Prints somewhat larger, but not so clear, so distinct, nor so pleasing to the Eye, as when I use the Empty Tapers. Also I am so confirm&#x27;d, that these empty tapers do preserve, strengthen, and in some small degree recover the sight.

* This may give occasion to consider, Whether to a sight much decay&#x27;d, a hindrance of the Refractions may be a Remedy? And whether that hindrance of Refractions, which helps some Eyes, helps not others?

And I find myself best at ease with those Leather Tubes, I first used; and rather without any fastening to the bone of the Spectacles: For, as they hang in that slight manner, I can with a touch of my finger raise them up, or bow them down, divide them, or unite to take in the same object, which is more than I said at first. And I put them off and on as speedily and as easily as any other Spectacles.

Yet being since farther encouraged by corresponding with some of the Royal Society in England, about a Moneth since, the said Physician, together with Monsieur Scheffeler, another ancient Practitioner in this City, repeated the Experiment by infusing Altering Medicines into the Veines of the right Armes of three persons: the one, lame of the Goute; the other, extremely Apoplextical; and the third, reduced to extremity by that odd distemper, the Plica Polonica. The Success of this, as Monsieur Hevelius (who was the person only admitted to be present at the operation) informes me, was; That the Gouty man found himself pretty well next day, and shortly after went to work, it being Harvest time, and has</div>
