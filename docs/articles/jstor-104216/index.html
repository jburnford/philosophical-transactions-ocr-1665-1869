<div class="ocr-text">at 11h, 59&#x27;, 50&quot;, Mercury preceded the Sun&#x27;s Centre 42&quot; in Right Ascension.

The Sky clearing up towards One o&#x27;Clock, the following Times were observed at Mr. Graham&#x27;s House with great Accuracy.

| Last interior Contact at | 1. 0. 42 |
| End, or Mercury just leaving the Sun&#x27;s Limb at | 1. 2. 16 |

This last Observation agrees to a Second with the same Observation made by Dr. Bevis at Mr. Sisson&#x27;s House in the Strand.

During the time of these Observations it blew a violent Gale of Wind, so that both Observers and Instruments were somewhat disturbed.
