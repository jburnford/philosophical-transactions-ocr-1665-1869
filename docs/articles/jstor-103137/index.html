<div class="ocr-text">very plain, allowing the Ascent of Water in small Tubes, and between the Surfaces of nearly contiguous Planes, to be explain&#x27;d from the Power of Attraction, that one Surface has to another at such a nearness (as I see no Reason to doubt it:) For the Drop of Oil moving on towards the contiguous Surfaces, comes to enlarge its space, and touches the Planes in more and more Parts, as it approaches nearer and nearer the touching side. Thus in the whole Progress of its Motion, it is continually encreasing in its Surface, and consequently the Power of Attraction must encrease in proportion to that Surface; so that the Celerity of its Motion must necessarily be augmented. This Experiment seems very powerfully to confirm the Experiments made before on the same Subject, from the gradual Increase of the Motion of the Drop; representing thereby the several Appearances of the Ascent of Water in different siz&#x27;d Tubes, or between Planes whose Surfaces are placed at different distances, the slower Motion representing those Experiments made in larger, and the swifter in smaller Tubes; the same to be observed in different distanc&#x27;d Planes.

I have since repeated the same Experiment in vacuo, where, in all Respects, it answered as in the open Air; which is a plain Indication, that the Presence of the Air has nothing at all to do in producing this Phenomenon.
