<div class="ocr-text">A new way of raising Water; by Dr. Papin, Fellow of the Royal Society.

Having seen it practised severall times, that after the Discovery of some new Problem, the Inventor propounds it as a Riddle, to stir up those that are ingenious in the same kind of learning, and make them find sometimes better things then what is propounded: I have thought I might do the same, with a way for raising water, which I think surely to be new, since it is not used in considerable occasions where it might be of great advantage.

AA. Is a great Glass made like a Tumbler, but much bigger, and laid upon the Chimney board BB.

CC. Is the Engine like a small Rock, that doth constantly spout out water by the two holes DD: this Rock is kept at a distance from the bottom of the Glass AA: so that it may plainly be seen that it cannot receive any water by subterranean Tubes.

EE. Is a factitious Corall reaching from the Center of the Rock CC. to the Center of the Crown FF.

FF. Is a Crown bearing upon the Aperture of the Glass AA. and holding the Rock CC. suspended at a considerable distance from the bottom.

GG. A Glass open at both ends applied to the Rock CC. to keep the water upon it from falling down.

HH. Two shells to receive the water from the Jetto&#x27;s.

I would have brought this Engine hither, but it is so apt to be spoiled, by carrying to and fro, that I hope the R. S. will pardon me, if I keep it at my lodging, where it may be seen at any time: and if they be pleased to appoint some that may come, and release one another, to watch it a whole day, and see whether it will not run constantly, nor loose any thing of its strength:
I hope that the learned in Hydrostaticks, being by these means assured of the possibility of such a Motion, will be the more ready to think of it, and find perhaps something better than this. But if no body doth it, I will myself within some months, publish this contrivance, with the uses it may be applied to.

According to the Inventors desire the Royal Society order&#x27;d that the thing should be observed: the Ingenious Mr. Hook saw it for near half an hour, there being other persons to observe it longer, who watch&#x27;t it about four hours together, during which time there sprung out of the Rock CC. above a hundred times more water, then a vessel of the same bigness could hold: so that they went away not doubting but the water did circulate in the said Engin, and might continue a great deal longer, since it did run still as constantly and as high as at their first coming: and the Honorable Mr. Boyl, knowing the whole contrivance of the Engine, affiures, that it may continue for a whole day and more; and thinks it worth to be left for some time, to the enquiry of Ingenious men.
