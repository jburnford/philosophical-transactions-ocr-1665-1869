<div class="ocr-text">her 27. and made by Fracassati and Malpighi; for it is contain&#x27;d in an Exercitation De Omento, annexed to the Tetras Anatomicarum Epistolarum Marcelli Malpighii and Caroli Fracassati de Lingua &amp; Cerebro, printed in Bologna. Since it was then omitted, it was thought worth the inserting now, viz.

The Epiploon, being look&#x27;d upon by a good Microscope, is like a great Sack full of abundance of other Small Sacks, which do inclose gatherings of Grease or Fat. There are many Vessels which may be call&#x27;d Adipous or Fatty, which issue out of this Membrane, and spreading themselves all over the Body, convey Fat to it, just as the Arteries carry the Blood all over the same. Wherever is Fat or Grease, there is found store of these little Sacks, wherein that is inclosed; whence it is, that in lean and emaciated Bodies, instead of Fat, you find nothing but Skins.

The structure of these small Sacks, and of the adipous Vessels, sufficiently sheweth, that the Fat is not formed accidentally out of the thick Vapours of the Blood, as is the common belief: Nor is its chief use to foment the natural Heat; but it seems rather to conduce to the allaying of the Acrimony of the Salts, that are in the Blood and the Serotities. And indeed (saith this Author) lean persons, and those whose Epiploon hath been cut, are more subject than others to Rheumatisms, Lienteries, and the like diseases that are caused by the sharpness of the Humours. And those that are fat, are not so easily seized on by them, in regard the Acrimony of the Serotities is corrected by the mixture of the Fat, just as the sharpest Lixivium will lose its force, if Oyl be mingled therewith.

Some Hortulan Communications about the curious engrafting of Oranges and Lemons, or Citrons, upon one another&#x27;s Trees, and of one Individual Fruit, half Orange and half Lemon growing on such Trees, &amp;c.

1. We have here Orange-trees, (saith the Intelligence from Florence) that bear a fruit, which is Citron on one side, and Orange on the other. They have not been brought hither out of other Countries, and they are now much propagated by Engrafting.

2. This was lately confirmed to us by a very ingenious English Gentleman, who asserted, that himself not only had seen, but bought of them An. 1660, in Paris, whither they had been sent by Genoa Merchants; and that on some Trees he had found an Orange on
on one branch, and a Lemon on another branch; as also (consonantly to the Florentine information) one and the same Fruit half Orange and half Lemon; and sometimes three quarters of one kind, and one quarter of the other.

3. A Provencial at Paris pretends to keep Orange-trees in that Town all the Winter long without any Fire, though they remain in the Earth, and not be put in Cases or Boxes. This is thought to be effected by a peculiar sort of Dung used for that purpose, and wrought deep into the Ground.

Q. Why should not the Experiment of some such thing be made about London, whose Latitude is but so little more Northward than that of Paris?

Enquiries for Greenland.

To discharge our Promise made in the last Transactions, we shall subjoin the following Queries, which we also purpose to recommend in due season, to some of those English Masters of Ships, and other fit persons, that shall Sail into Greenland for the whale-fishing; intreating withall, as many as have conveniency, to assist us in these recommendations.

The Enquiries are,

1. What, and how much is the heat of the Sun there in the midst of the Summer, compar&#x27;d with the heat of it in England? to be observed with a seal&#x27;d Thermometer.

2. What is the most constant weather there in Summer, whether Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, Foggy &amp;c.

3. What weather is most usual at such and such times of the year?

4. What constancy or unconstancy there is of the Wind to this or that quarter of the Horizon, or to this or that part of the year?

5. What the Temperature of each particular Wind is observ&#x27;d to be? And particularly, whether the North-Wind be the coldest? If not, what wind is? whether is the colder, the East or West, &amp;c.

6. What Wind is observed to bring most Ice, and what to make a clear Water at Sea?

7. What Currents there are? How fast, and which way they set? Whether those Currents are not stronger at one time of the Moon than at another? Whether they always run one way?

8. What is observable about the Tides, Spring or Neap? How</div>
