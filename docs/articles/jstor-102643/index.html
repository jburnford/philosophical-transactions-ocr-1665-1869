<div class="ocr-text">Of the Origin of white Vitriol and the Figure of its Crystals, not yet accounted for, by Dr. Martin Lister, F.R.S.

Amongst the Desiderata, relating to Fossil Salts, the Origin that I know of white Vitriol is obscure, and its Crystals undescribed.

All I can find of this matter is out of Borrichius de Docimastice metallica, that it is produced from a certain Lead Ore, boiled raw. (Plumbi nigri vena vitriolum album producit, etiam non cremata) none, that I know of, of our English Lead Ores gives us any suspicion of any such Vitriol. It is true, I have by me some Sorts of white Lead Ore Spar-like, plentifully yielding Lead: But I cannot say that either those or any coloured Lead Ores, did give me any reason to suspect, after diverse experiments upon them, that yielded white Vitriol.

As to the Crystals of white Vitriol, they are very difficult to describe, and seem to me to be a congeries of infinite small Needles, for which reason it is of a most speedy Operation, and irritates the Stomach suddenly, before they can be well dissolved or broken.

I recommend the inquiry of both these particulars concerning white Vitriol, to the Industry and Diligence of the Curious.</div>
