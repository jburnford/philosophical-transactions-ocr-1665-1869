<div class="ocr-text">VI. An Extract of a Letter from James Logan, Esq; to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. R. S. Pr. concerning the crooked and angular Appearance of the Streaks, or Darts of Lightning in Thunder-Storms.

Philadelphia, Sept. 20, 1735.

I shall crave thy Indulgence further to add, that looking into the Second Volume of that ingenious Gentleman Stephen Hales&#x27;s Staticks, of which I have lately happened to have a cursory View, I observed him to mention that Phenomenon of the Streaks or Darts of Lightning in Thunder-Storms appearing crooked and angular (I do not remember his Words) as a thing not yet accounted for; and therefore he guessed at a Solution of it*.

The Clouds are generally distinct Collections of Vapours like Fleeces, and therefore the Rays of Light thro&#x27; them must pass thro&#x27; very different Densities, and accordingly suffer very great Refractions: From thence therefore, undoubtedly, that Appearance must arise. For it is most highly absurd to imagine, that Fire darted with such a Rapidity, can from any assignable Cause deviate in Fact from a Right Line, in the Manner it appears to us. And this, if duely considered, may probably be found a plenary Solution.

* See Steph. Hales&#x27;s Statical Essays Vol. 2d. p. 291:
