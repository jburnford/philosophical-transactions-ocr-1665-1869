<div class="ocr-text">A Problem
For finding the Year of the Julian Period by a new and very easy Method.

This occurs in the Journal des Savans no. 36, as it had been proposed and communicated by the Learned Jesuit DE BILLY, viz.

Multiply the Solar Cycle by 4845, and the Lunar, by 4200, and that of the Indiction, by 5916. Then divide the Sum of the products by 7980, which is the Julian Period: The Remainder of the Division, without having regard to the Quotient, shall be the year enquired after.

E.g. Let the Cycle of the Sun be 3; of the Moon 4; and of the Indiction 5. Multiply 3. by 4845, and you have 14535; and 4. by 4200, comes 16800; and 5. by 6916, comes 34580. The Sum of the products is 65915, which being divided by 7980, gives 8. for the Quotient, and the number 2075, which remains, is the Year of the Julian Period.

Some learned Mathematicians of Paris, to whom the said P. de Billy did propose this Problem, have found the Demonstration thereof; as the same Journal intimates.

I. TENTAMINA PHYSICO-THEOLOGICA DE DEO, Sive THEOLOGIA SCOLASTICA, ad Normam Nova &amp; Reformata Philosophia concinnata, &amp; duobus libris comprehensa. Quorum altero, de Dei existentia adversus Atheos et Epicureos ex ipsorum Principiis disputatur; altero, de Eisdem Essentia &amp; Attributis; primo, secundum Theologiam Ethicam, ubi explicatur, Quantum habentis Alii in Gentilium sententiis, de summi Numinis Natura erundis, hallucinari facerint; deinde secundum Theologiam Christianam: Et quid de Divina Essentia ac Attributis statuendis sit, deservitur. Quibus proptermod accedit specialis Dissertatio de Primo Numinis Attributo, AETERNITATE. Authore Samuele Parker, A.M.

This Treatise, publish&#x27;d the last year, would sooner have been taken notice off in these Tracts, had it not escaped the Publishers view till of late, when he, upon serious perusal, found it very worthy the recommending it to all sorts of persons, and particularly to those, who either please themselves with that fond opinion, That Philosophy is the Apprentiship of Atheisme; or hearken to the aspersions, that are generally laid upon the Reformation of Philosophy.

This excellent piece removes both these; and being joyned and compared with the truly Noble Mr. Boyle&#x27;s Considerations in his First Part of the Useful...</div>
