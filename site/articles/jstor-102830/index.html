<div class="ocr-text">II. A Description of some Shells found on the Molucca Islands; as also an Account of Mr Sam. Brown, his Fourth Book of East India Plants, with their Names, Vertues, &amp;c. By James Petiver, Apothecary and Fellow of the Royal Society.

The following Shells were brought me from the Molucca Islands, by my Ingenious Friends Mr Sylvanus Landon and Mr Rowleston Jacobs.

1. Tellina Moluccana densè fasciata &amp; eleganter undata. an. Tellina magna lutescens, tenuiter fasciata, undatim depicta List. Hist. Conchyl. Tab. 402. Lib. 3. Fig. 246.

This Shell is near 3 inches long, and one and a half wide, white about the edges within, and yellowish in the middle; without it&#x27;s fasciated with capillary striæ, which are wider and deeper near the edges; cross these are many brown reticulated and undulated streaks, which if viewed with the Hing downwards, appear like the Coralline branches in a polish Mocha-stone, one of these Valves weighed 3iiib.

Amongst Mr Stonestreet&#x27;s Curious Collection of Shells, I very lately saw one of these, which was near half clouded with brown, as Dr Lister&#x27;s Figure represents it.

2. Patella alba Orientalis, profunde sulcato, umbone elevato. an. Patella I. Aldrov. de Test. 546. Fig. id. Francof.

This differs from the Patella Cypria major striata Aldr. Test. 548. Fig. id. Franc. in being white, more transparent, and its head higher, and the whole Shell nothing near so thick or heavy. Mr Fox and Mr Cunningham, Surgeons.
geons, have observed this at the Cape of Good Hope.

3. Concha Veneris Ascentionis maculata, rimâ croccâ.

Concha Veneris crassa, dorso nebulato, lateribus raris maculis nigris depictis, ipsa ventris rima subcrocea Lift. H. Conch. Lib. 4. Sect. 9. Tab. 683. Fig. 30. Saffron-tooth&#x27;d Cowrie.

This is a thick and heavy Shell, as big as a Pidgeons egg; on the back spotted and speckled, but on the sides spotted only; its Teeth of a Turmerick colour, its Belly white and peculiarly shap&#x27;d, with an edge as if cut: by which and its Teeth it&#x27;s easily distinguisht from all others.

4. Concha Veneris Ascensionis, fusca macula utroque late. Concha Veneris cinerea infinitis albis puncturis exiguis depicta, item ad median marginem utrinque latâ macula ex fusco nigricante Lift. H.C. l. 4. S. 9. Tab. 691. Fig. 39. Side spotted Cowry.

This is a small Greyish Cowry, sprinkled with pale Specks, some of which lye in cloudy spots. It&#x27;s remarkable for one large one, in the middle of each side, like a bruise or black Eye; but more especially obvious on the smooth side, the other being furrowed to the exterior edge.

5. Concha Veneris Moluccensis, parva, verrucosa, apicibus flavescentibus. an Concha Veneris fusca, utroque capite ex fusco flavescente, exiguis vel punctis vel tuberculis exasperata, ventre latè striato Lift. H. C. l. 4. S. 9. Tab. 708. Fig. 58.

I believe these change their colour from brown to white, but they are easily distinguisht by their yellowish tips and serrated belly: they are scarce so big as a Luke Olive, and weigh not above 10 grains.

6. Veneroides umbilicata, Moluccensis marmorata. an Concha Veneris umbilicata major fusca sive variegata Lift. H. C. L. 4. S. 9. Tab. 713. Fig. 69. an Cochlea immerso turbine or Diping Snail Mus. Regal. Societ. p. 128: Tab. 9. whose Figure and Magnitude it very much resembles; except that in the back it&#x27;s only pounc&#x27;t between the capilla-
ry veins, whereas this is marbled like the inside of a Nutmeg: this weighs somewhat more than 3iij.

7. Cylindraceus Moluccensis, luteis maculis, intus purpurascens. an Rhombus ex fusco maculatus, labro ex viola purpurascente Lift. H. C. l. 4. S. 10. Tab. 719. Fig. 3.

I have 4 of these near of a bigness, viz. an inch and ½ long, and 2 ¼ about, are white with yellow spots, and in some seem to be mixt with blue specks. These weigh between 2 and 3 drams.

8. Cylindroides Moluccanus major, agris &amp; lineis ex albo aureoque eleganter interpositis. an Cochlea Cylindroides altera Aldr. Test. edit. Francof. p. 135. cap. 38. Tab. 9. p. 133. id. ed. Bon. p. 399. Fig. which Figure in this Bononia Edition very exactly resembles this Shell, as well in Jonst. aq. Tab. xii. its reticulations as in its shape and bigness. an Cochlea Cylindroides alter Jonst. Aquat. p. 39. Tab. 12. Fig. but the Icon here has lost its netted veins. an Rhombus cylindro pyramidali ex rufo vermiculatus sive maculis in-qualibus reticulatus. Lift. H. C. l. 4. S. 10. Tab. 790. Fig. 43. Aldrovands Cloath of Gold.

This differs from that of Rondeletius de Test. p. 99. (as Aldrovandus well observes) his being no bigger than ones thumb, and flatter at the base, and not so thick as this.

9. Cylindroides Moluccanus levis, ex rufo alboque Marmoratus. an Bonan. 157. Fig. 319. Light Molucca Cloath.

This is marbled with Chestnut and White Clouds and Reticulations, without either firiæ or fisiciæ, is 3 inches long, and about one and ½ thick, yet weighs but 3i.

1c. Cylindroides Moluccanus crafus, carneus, fasciis capillaceis fuscis, dense circumcinctus. Heavy Molucca Cloath.

This is flesh coloured, very thick beset with brown hairy fasciæ, from the middle of its belly rises one spiral girdle, tending upwards ½ inch broad, this is of the same magnitude with the last, but weighs 3i. 3v. &amp; 3i. which is 3i. 3i &amp; 3i heavier.
11. Rhombus Madraspat. albus, parvus, maculis, quadrangularibus nigricantibus fasciatis Act. Phil. No. 271. p. 271. p. 859. 5. an List. H. C. l. 4. S. 10. Tab. 779. Fig. 25; an Bon. 27. Fig. 122. Black Diamond Stamper.

12. Pyramidalis Moluccensis ex rufo alboq; mixtus. an Rhombus subluteus cylindro pyramidali, lineis quibusdam punctatis &amp; fascijs undatis depictus List. H. C. l. 4. S. x. Tab. 780. Fig. 27. It&#x27;s an inch broad at the base, and 1 ¼ long, weighs 3vi. &amp; 3i.

13. Olivaris Moluccensis dentatus nigrescens, undis albis. an List. H. C. l. 4. S. 11. Tab. 827. Fig. ult. About the bigness of a Horse-bean, with a ferrated purple mouth; weighs just gr x. or 3i.

14. Unicornu Moluccanum, eburneum, grave, lituris nigris fasciatis. Buccinum dentatum grande bifasciatum List. H. C. l. 4. S. 11. Tab. 846. Fig. 74. Buccinum Persicum eburneum Maculosum alterum nitidum μαργαλητον Col. Obs. Aq. 56. c. 24. Fig. opt. p. 53. Turbo Bonan. 317. Fig. p. 157. Columnas, Ivory Telescope.

The upper twirls are large and smooth, in each of which are 2 rows of black spots, the upper small, the lower twirls seem divided betwixt these 2 rows. The whole Shell is very thick and heavy.

15. Unicornulus recurvirostrus Moluccens. verrucosus. an List. H. C. l. 4. S. 15. Tab. 1024. Fig. 90.

Near 1 inch long and above ¼ broad at top, its lower twirls are alternately welted, it&#x27;s wholly covered with Warts, but the largest are round each upper Fasciae: Weighs above 3i.

16. Buccinulum Moluccense oblongum, costis per longitudinem sulcis capillaceis cinctis.

This is ridged from head to point, its upper twirl, which is above ½ the Shell, has 2 whitish girths with hairy furrows, its right lip has 3 twisted ribs; is ½ inch broad and 1 long: Weighs near 3ii.

17. Buc-
17. *Buccinulum* bilingue *Moluccense* sessile, castaneum fasciis albis. an *Buccinum* bilingue læve, tenue fasciatum, leviter compressum, ore purpurascente *Lift. H.C.* l. 4. S. 12. Tab. 847. Fig. 1. It&#x27;s back Chesnut with 6 White girths, the right lip black and smooth, the left brown, striated beyond the edge, which is smooth and white, on this side are 2 sinuses, or notches at top, and one below.

18. *Buccinum* bilingue *Moluccense* nodosum.

This is very like the next, but somewhat broader and flatter, and is chiefly distinguisht in having 3 prominences towards the point of the Shell, and has no circles on the back, as the other hath.

19. *Buccinum* bilingue *Moluccense* nodosum &amp; fasciatum digito productiore. *Buccinum* bilingue ex rufo variegatum, ore interno subcroceo profundè striatum, muricatum *Lift. H.C.* l. 4. S. 12. Tab. 871. Fig. 26.

These are generally about the bigness of a *Hens Egg*, are girdled over the back, and knobbed, especially the middle circle; the inside is tinged with a Saffron colour; it&#x27;s double tongued, and particularly distinguisht by a finger-like point below.

20. *Aporrhais Orientalis* heptadactylon. Aristotle&#x27;s Aporrhais.

*Aporrhais* Rondelet. aquatil. 79. Fig. id. Gallic. 51. c. 6. Rond. ag. 79. id. Gall. c. 6. Aldr. Taf. Eox. 343. Aldr. Taf. Franc. Tab. 6. Fig. 18. x 19. Bcn. 157. Fig. 12. Lift. H.C Tab. 866 and 367.

These Figures and Description agree very well with this Shell. Johnston in his Histor. Natural. Exang. Aquat. Amst. Tab. xi. has transposed this, and figured it under the Title of Murex Coracoides, and the Aporrhais under it. Bonan. 157. Fig. 12 &amp; 13.

*Buccinum* bilingue maximum, leve, ore purpurascente, labro multi digitato *Lift. H.C.* l. 4. S. 12. Tab. 866. Fig. 21. &amp; Tab. 867. Fig. 22. which last Figure exactly resembles the belly of this Shell, whose inside has a Phyllamort cast, and
and in some streakt with white, it&#x27;s marked on the back with Chesnut clouds, and is distinguished from all others, in having 7 extended spikes, viz. one at each end, and 5 along the side.

Mr Edward Bulkley sent me some time since a very fair one of this kind from Fort St George.

21. Murex Moluccensis Castaneus, lineis Capillaceis interne &amp; externe ornatus. Murex duplici fasciola in spiram con-torta a basi ad mucronem vittatus Bonan. 153. Fig. 287. Buccinum rostratum duplicibus lineolis subfuscis circunda-tum inter sinus nodosum List. H. C. l. 4. S. 14. Tab. 931. Fig. 26.

Outside.

It&#x27;s outside brown, girdled with double lines \( \frac{1}{8} \) of an inch asunder, these pairs stand but very little closer then the spaces between; the middle of each twirl is knobbed, particularly the 4 uppermost; its inside is thick set with brown capillary lines at equal distances, having about 8 in \( \frac{1}{8} \) an inch, these are carried out of sight; by its double lines and knobs without, and streaks within, it&#x27;s easily distinguished from all others of this kind.

22. Buccinum Neritodes Benghalense perelegans Marmo-reum. Buccinum brevirostrum, labrosum, costis latis pli-catilibus &amp; acutis distinctum List. H. C. l. 4. S. 15. Tab. 992. Fig. 55. Bonan. 135. Fig. 185. Concha Neerwass altera minor variegata Col. Obs. aq. c. 36. p. 70. desc. Fig. 69.

Fair-wing.

This is a very beautiful Shell, and may be easier known by the aforesaid Authors Figures of it, than can be described by words.

23. Buccinulum Moluccense labrosum dorso gibbo-so an Buccinum brevi rostrum columella callosa, undatis striis leviter distinctum e rufo fasciatum List. H. C. l. 4. S. 15. Tab. 971. Fig. 26. The Molucca Hunchekin.

These weigh commonly about 10 grains, yet I have one heavier than a scruple.
24. Bursa Moluccana labro spinoso.

Turbo auritus cum labris duplici dentium ordine munitis Bonan. 130. Fig. 152. Buccinum recurvirostrum tenue, ventre strictiore undatum Llst. H. C. l. 4. S. 15. Tab. 1015. Fig. 73.

Bonani his Figure and Dr Lister&#x27;s, pretty well resemble this Shell; and what is peculiar in it, are its serrae or spines in the upper part of the left lip; which the Icon takes notice of, and in our Shell are four.

Mr Samuel Brown his 4th Book of East-India Plants.

Gathered from the first to the fourth of April, 1696. at Perre-pollum and Eremita-pollum, 12 or 14 miles from Fort St George. Ground sandy. Clay reddish. Pretty Plain.

138. Maula poo Malab.

The Leaves and Flowers are hoary, and agree with the Figure in the Hort. Malab. Its Fruit (stands in its Flower-busk) somewhat bigger than a Pea, rough and hairy, depress&#x27;d at the top, with a small point in the center; it has a tendency to 4 sulce or furrows, each containing one Kernel.
Grows 3 or 4 foot high. The Natives who have pains in the head and in all their bones, fume with the Powder of this whole Plant, put on live Coals and pretty well covered, which produces plentiful Sweats, and does much good. S.B.

139. Arbor Eremitana Lauro-Cerasi folio.
Sumtra-poonee Malab.

The Leaves are thick and very like our Laurel, but some rounder, they grow on short footstalks, which are ribb&#x27;d as the twigs, at the setting on of these Leaves come forth small clusters of little Flowers, with scarce any footstalks, which are followed by a fruit I have not yet examined because unripe, yet some of them are bigger than a Cherry, adhering to a foliaceous calyx like the seed of our Elm, but much less.

Grows 6 or 8 foot high, thick as ones wrist. A Decoction of the Leaves are Carminative and expel Wind. S.B.

These Leaves resemble the Wild Olive, the Spike white and soft, otherwise very like the Gramen Panicecum spica divisa 1. C. B. 8. Dr Sherard, that accurate Botanist, assures me, this is not the Salvia Amaranthoides M. Nutii Fascic. Herb. 60. as Dr Pluknet supposes.

Is about 3 foot high; the Natives put this in a Cloath between two unglazed Pots to boil: So that the fume of the Water in the undermost may moisten the Herb, which they press out, and give 2 spoontuls of it warm for Cough and Astma. S.B.
141. Cammal-Maraum. Malab.

Arbor Eremitana, Ponae minore crassioreque folio.

The Leaves are thick and stiff, the middle rib is furrowed on the upper side, and much raised on the under, ends blunt, and is often cleft; these stand on very short footstalks, are thick set, and grow inordinately; from the bottom of these Leaves grow clusters of small hexapetalous Flowers like those of Laurustinus, each standing on a ½ inch footstalk, which seems rather the pipe of the Flower.

Is about 28 foot high, and above a foot diameter; the Root and Bark in powder given to those who are hoarse with great Colds is a good Medicine. S. B.

Tab. 5. p. 9. an Solanum arborens Indicum foliis Napecæ minoribus, fructu rotundo duro &amp; semine orbiculare compressio minoribus Breyn. pr. 2.

The Leaves of this differ from S. B. 28. in being smaller, narrower and sharp-pointed, the Fruit rounder and much less, not exceeding a Hazel-nut.

Is about 7 or 8 foot high, and as thick as ones wrist, the Powder or Decoction of the Root, Bark and Leaves cures Hoeticks and other Feavers, also Consumption, Cough and Astma. S. B.

an Cit. ambel. Malab. Casturi Camalla Bram. H. Mal. V. xi. Tab. 27. p. 53. an Nymphea Malabarica minor folio ferrato Comel. in H. Malab. p. 53.

This is very like our White Water-Lilly of the Shops, but less both in Leaf and Flower. I wonder how Dr Plukenet could be so egregiously mistaken as to refer this to the Nedel Ambel of the Hort. Malab. V.xi.Tab. 28. p. 55. it being vastly different, and he knowing it to be another Plant.
The Natives here give the Root and Flower for the running of the Reins and to correct Choler, and they say &#x27;tis cooling and refreshing. S. B.

144. Cooltee yella Malab.

Grows in the Water; this cures the Itch or Scab, by applying the Leaves ground to pulp, and washing with a Decoction of the same. There are many species of this, I have taken notice of about 10 sorts, but they are very hard to preserve, so that I cannot send them now. S. B.

Grows 30 or 35 foot high, and a foot and half thick: A Decoction of the Bark cures the Tooth-ach by washing the Mouth with it: the Kernels ground with Lime-juice and put in the Eye, cures pains in the Head, Lethargy, &amp;c. S. B.

Dr Sherard gave me this day, viz. Novemb. 5. 1701. a very well preserved Flower of this Tree, which he gathered this Summer in her Grace the Dutchess of Beaufort&#x27;s Gardens at Badminton. In colour, shape and magnitude it exactly resembles Polemonium Monspelienese, or yellow Jasmin, and is very well expressed in the 15th Table of the Hort. Malab. on the right hand, towards the bottom of the Plate.

Dr Plukenet hath given us this 3 times over, viz. First, under the Name of Arbor Orientalis digitatis Samouna folis serratis, floribus stamineis in spicam pendulis, fructu oblongo quadrilatero coronato Almag. Botan. 47. 5.

Grows between 30 and 40 foot high, and about a foot and half diameter: A Decoction of the Root and Bark is cooling, good in Cholerick distempers, it also cures the running of the Reins. The Fruit, when ripe, is as big as a large Apple, and full of sourish Winey pulp (which is good in Fluxes) with white soft seeds as big as a great pins head. This Fruit, in shape, colour and bigness resembles the Cydonia Indica, which tastes like Gum Arabick: Two handfuls of the Leaves boil&#x27;d in water to about 4 ounces, will give 6 or 7 stools, and not gripe in the least. These Leaves soon spoil, otherwise they would (being aromatick) much exceed Senna. S. B.

It is about 4 foot high, and generally consists of small branches, this is white, but here is another species of the same name which is more reddish, differing in nothing else; they both when broken yield a Milk, which dry is hot as Euphorbium, and like it in colour. The Bark of its Root chewed and held to the aking Tooth cures it. The Leaf and Flowers made into a Poultise, and putto Cods swelled (by stopping a Gonorrhea too soon) takes it away, as also the pain, tho never so violent. The Leaves spread on a Cloath, and hot Sand powred on them, and the Cloath tyed, so that the heat of the Sand may penetrate the Leaves, and applied to any cold pain, renewing them as they cool, easies pains to a Miracle: the same also easies the Gout, as I have tryed. S. B.

151. Ponelle-chedde Malab.

Acacia Benghalensis Bonduch folio filiquis dorso nervosis. Mus. Petiv. 601.

This is a very beautiful Climber, extending very far, and thick in branches. A Decoction of the whole Plant cures all sorts of Intermittent Fevers: The Leaves and Branches boil&#x27;d in Water, Grewel or Broath cleanses the blood in the said Fevers of the Morbid humour, and creates an Apperite.

Rises 30, sometimes 40 foot high, generally 6 or 7 inches diameter: It seems to be jointed almost like a Fishing-Cane, which Joints are generally about 4 inches distant. The Leaves grow on
Ly at the top; the Fruit on a Branch which grows out of the Tree near the top: The Natives here do not use the Tree nor Leaves in Phyick, but they make a very pleasant Purge or Laxative Medicine, by boiling the Root, Fruit and Flower in Water, giving 3 or 4 ounces of it to an ordinary man, it purges Choler and expels Wind: Garcia says the distilled Water of the Fruit was his Panacea in Cholerick Fluxes, but here &#x27;tis of no use against them. S.B.

153. Vailumbash Malab.
Hippuris aquatica Orientalis polypermos.
This is a Water Plant, the Stalk is big as a Straw, and rises 3 or 4 foot high: but is not used by the Natives for Physick. S.B.

154. Cariwaopullee Malab.
Æleagnus Eremitana Vacciniæ nigrae fol. perforato.
It is about 4 or 5 foot high, all in branches, about a finger, and sometimes 2 fingers thick; &#x27;tis good to correct Choler, and stop Vomiting and Looseness, by taking a Cup night and morning of the Decoction of its Leaves and Tendrils; the Natives use it very much in their Carries, (Sawces or Pickles.) The Berries are something warm and aromatic, so are the Leaves. S.B.

157. Poaka
157. Poula-mullee Malab.

Manja-pu Malabarica flore odoratissimo fugaci.

Dr Plukenet very erroneously ranks this Tree amongst the Sun pluk. Flowers, calling it Chrysanthemum Orellanae foliis impense scabris, Maderaspatanum, horum petalis quinis, tetragonis sex calyce ample viridi fistulosis Pluk. Tab. 83. Fig. H. Ox. Sect. 6. p. 24. 78. defc. if Dr Plukenet has the Arbor triflitis Myrto similis CB. 496. as he pretends, (as also to give a cut of it in his 262 Table, Fig. 3. which we cannot there find) he would oblige the world to let us know wherein it differs from his Chrysanthemum above; which I take to be the Manja pu maram Hort. Malab. V. 1. Tab. 21. p. 35. Paratacu Bram. Ray H. Pl. 1698. cap. x.

Grows 6 or 8 foot high, thick as ones arm; the Bark and Root cures Consumptions, Cough and Asthma, by drinking the Decoction: The Flower is very odorous, but hard to get, falling off the Tree at day-break and soon shrivels and dissolves. This, I think, is the Arbor Triflitis. The Flower is very cordial and fragrant. S. B. 92. There are 2 others which may be refer&#x27;d to this, viz. S. B. 92. and S. B. 125. both these fall off the Tree in the morning, the last is very sweet, the other is smaller and not so sweet. S. B.

This is the Tree on which it&#x27;s supposed the Ants work the Lack. Grows 28 or 30 foot high, and 8 or 10 inches diameter: This is the true Masanas, the other S. B. 64. is the wild Ber and Bor Acoftæ Park. 1636. cap. 102. A Decoction of the Root, Bark and Leaves cures the Gripes and all Fluxes; the Fruit also (which is bigger than SB. 64.) is binding. S. B.

Jujuba Ercmitana spinosa, folio maximo rigido.

an Frutex Bisnagaricus spinosus, Coryli foliis densis, spinis brevioribus crassis Pluk. Tab. 29. 7.

This is a species of Masanas or Ber, but is the least sort, being a low shrub; all the 3 sorts have prickles; the Leaves of this S. B. 158. stop Urine, is good also for the same as S B 64 &amp; S B 158 are. S. B. 159. The Natives eat this with beaten Rice. S. B.
160. Code maoca taree Malab.

Coccifera Madraspat. Capparidis facie spinola, fructu umbella modo nascente Mus. Petiv. 631.

This Climber is a species of Mooca taree S.B. 16. A Decoction of this cures Infants of Scald heads and Scabby Itch; which the Natives call Carpaun: but those of 3 or 4 years old must bruise and apply it outwardly, S.B.

161. Pecalah Malab.

These seem 2 Plants, but both are good for the same use, and are both Climbers; the Decoction or Powder of either of these cures Fox, Bruises, Itch, Scabs, &amp;c. taken daily for 15 or 20 days: It is a little laxative. S.B.

If Dr Plukenet be not fond of pretending to more Plants than he can shew, he can easily clear these doubts, having in his Almag. Bot. p. 195, 6, 7. this and the last supposed ones, with most of the other Jasmins in the Hort. Malab.

162. Surnavul Malab.

Laurus tinus Madraspat. trifoliatus Mus. Petiv. 259. &amp; S.B. 18.

Is about 6 or 8 foot high, and thick as ones Arm. A Decoction of the Root and Bark of this cures Pocky Rheumatick pains, it also dissolves Nodes, &amp;c. S.B.

With the same Account, and under the same Name, I have also received it from Mr Edward Bulkley at Fort St George, and is the same with S.B. 18. this being in Fruit and that in Flower.

163. Alaternus Eremitana Ilicis folio.

The Label to this is lost. But Mr Edward Bulkley hath lately sent
fent it me under the Malabar name of Veera Maraum, who gathered it in the month of April in Berry.

164. Paring chekka Malab.

Senecio Madraspatana Rapi folio, floribus maximis, cujus radix a nonnullis China dicitur Muf. Petiv. 680.

This we call here China-root, but is very different from what you described with prickles. This cured one Mr Ingram of a Consumption, who had linger&#x27;d many years, at the New Fort. &#x27;Tis 2 foot high: The Root just like China-root: When I have more Experience of it you shall hear farther. S. B.

165. Todallee Malab.

Lycium Eremitanum Buxi foliis obtusis.

Is 6 or 8 foot high, thick as ones wrist. A spoonful or 2 of the Decoction of the Root and Bark given to Infants cures the Itch and Scab, and what we call the Carpaung: the Fruit is pleasant and eatable. S. B. This differs from S. B. 62. in having thinner obtuse Leaves, and grow not exactly opposite. These Berries come from the bosom of the Leaves, the other at the ends or divisions of the branches only.

166. Marloo-mattee Malab.

Is a foot or 1½ high: The Natives use it to procure Love, and mixing it with other things, make a fort of Philiter: but I do not believe it has any such power. It has when fresh a pleasing smell, and stops Fluxes. S. B.

This, as I have already hinted (in my Herb. Unaneerc. in the Philosoph. Transact. No 224. p. 318. II.) seems nothing different from our Xanthium, or Lesser Burdock.

167. Chedde meel&#x27;cheddee Malab.

Kanni-Viscum Eremitanum floribus spicatis.

Is a fort of Polypodium: &#x27;twas gathered from a small thorny Tree, bearing a small red Fruit, which is sweet and eatable. The Natives say, if every morning any person takes half a Pagoda, that is, 3fl. of the powder of it, &#x27;twill prevent all distempers, and prolong youth: Taken night and morning cures Leprosies, it purges gently. S. B.

Calamus Aromaticus Orientalis folio &amp; radice tenuiore.

Acorus verus sive Calamus aromaticus Asiaticus radice tenuiore.

H. Lugd. Bat. 9. Calamus Aromaticus Garz. l. i. c. 22.
This is our *Calamus Aromaticus*: The Natives here use it for many Distempers, it helps Digestion, stops Vomiting and Loose-ness, procures Women&#x27;s purgations, is Diuretic, &amp;c. S.B.

169. Carututee Malab.

*Prunifera Tercucheana folio Vitis*, subtus lanoso.

Is 6 or 8 foot high, and thick as one&#x27;s arm: This I gathered on a Mountain 20 mile from Madras; call&#x27;d *Tercucheonum*, on which is a Pagoda, the Bramins of which have taught strange White Birds to come every day at noon to eat, which having done, they wash in Water in the cliff of the Rock, and so fly away again; by this Artifice they get much Money, making the superstitious believe their Fables, &amp;c.

A Decoction of the Root, Bark and Fruit, cures Gripes, Fluxes and Gonorrhea. The Leaves of no use. S.B.

The Leaves help to make a red dye or colour, the Root boil&#x27;d is good for a Cough; the Flowers are of a pure blue, almost purple; it&#x27;s as thick as one&#x27;s arm, and grows 6 or 7 foot high. S.B.

172. Ea-cheddee Malab.

*Waga Eremitana spinosa*, Mimosa foliis subtus incanis.

A sort of Bramble, which if it gets into any place spreads much, and is hard to be rooted out; the Natives moisten these Leaves with Water and press out the Juice; which because &#x27;tis very bitter, they mix some Sugar with it, and give it for pains in the Back, which it seldom fails to cure: The Flower is fragrant when fresh. S.B.

173. Cammala Malab.

*Lycium Eremitanum spinis foliaceis Sefami flore*.

Grows 5 or 6 foot high, and almost as thick as one&#x27;s wrist. The Root of this, and Bark beaten with Rice and eaten, cures pains in the Back and Rheumatism. S.B.

174. Caunum pulee Malab.

*Perexil Eremitan*. Parietariae folio, paniculis speciosis.

This trails on the ground, but here is another Species, called *Pula*.
Pula-cheddee, which rises a foot or 2 high, a Decoction of both which and Borax cures stoppage of Urine. S. B.

175. Ardanapalle Malab. H. Unaneerc. 29. Aet. P. N. 244.

Ariftclochia Unanecroondaca, vulgaris facie.

How much this differs from our kinds I cannot yet distinguish. It&#x27;s a Species of the Stringy rooted.

The Natives grind the whole Plant, and apply it to the Belly to expel Worms; other use they know not: the Moors give it their Horses to eat to fatten them, which I have seen; but the Malabars think it to be Poyson, because the Goats eat it not. S.B. s. B. 175.

176. Poonaree Pillee Malab.

Cyperi facie Eremitana planta, foliis pubescentibus capitulis squarrosis. Is not used in Physick. S. B.

177. Naiwaliee Malab.

The Decoction expels Wind, the Juice cures pains in the Ears; &#x27;tis said by the Natives to be very hot. S. B.

178. Suree-cheddee Malab.

Toddali Ipinosus Madraspat. medio nervo ex altera parte folii percurrente Mus. Petiver. 689.

A low prickley Plant about 2 foot high; the Berries of this the Crows do not eat, therefore the Natives think them Poyson, but the powder of the whole Plant (them excepted) they give for Apoplexies, Palsy, Epilepsy and Convulsion, which cures to a Miracle. S. B.

This is Nimbo, but there is another wild sort call&#x27;d Molle-Wam-Fragos. c. 7. boo S. B. N. 26. this is a large Tree, about 35, and sometimes 40 feet.
foot high, and about a foot and \(\frac{1}{2}\) diameter; the Oyl of the Seeds cures a Distemper very incident to lying in Women, here by the Natives called Janney, which proceeds from taking cold, as they say, and is very dangerous; a Decoction of the Bark drank cures Frenzy and Madness: The Powder or Decoction of the Root of this Tree, when 50 years old, or at its full growth, cures the Lepra. The tender Sprigs, which here they call Ecla&#x27;s (and is a common name for other straight Straw-like things of which they make Brooms) stript of its Leaves cures Infants almost choak&#x27;d with Phlegm, they also strengthen the Stomach, stop Vomiting, correct Choler, and keep the Body laxative; the Juice of the Leaves cures Worms in young or old; to correct its great Bitterness it may be mixt with Sugar: The Natives put 2 or 3 drops of the afore-said Oyl up the Nose, which causes very much Slime and Filth to be voided, and cures old pains of the Head and Astma: The Leaves ground with a little Turmerick and Salt cures all sorts of Ulcers, Aches, Strains or Bruises: The Bark, ground with the Juice of its own Leaves and a little Lime-juice, intallibly cures all sorts of Itch or Ring-worms, by anointing outwardly, and taking some of the Root and Bark inwardly: This Tree is good for many other things, and is indeed held by the Natives for a general Panacea.

Of this the Natives in all count 4 sorts. 1. This which they Cultivate in Gardens, and is a large Tree. 2. Mallee-wamboo, which is a lesser wild kind, as aforesaid. S. B. 26. 3. Carreampelle, which is less than either of the 2 former, Leav&#x27;d like them, only these are not jagged on the edges. 4. Nalee-Weambo, which is very little, not above 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\) foot high, but is the bitterest of all; this is of great use with the Natives, and is Cordial, comforts the Stomach, stops Vomitings, Looseness, &amp;c. this has a bitter smell, and I doubt it may at least be a species of the Calamus Aromaticus Syriacus, of which more, with the bitter Reeds, mark&#x27;d N. 67; this resembles the former in nothing but its Bitterness, for which only the Natives count it a species of it.

Note, that the many alterations which the Malabars have for the names of Plants, is apt to make confusion; which, tho I avoid with all possible care, yet at N. 26. this Waapa-Maraum is there styld Nella Wampulle; and this is, I believe, the chief error I have made of this kind. S. B.</div>
