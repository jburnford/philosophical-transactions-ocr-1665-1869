<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">VII. An Account of what appeared most remarkable on opening the Body of Ann Edwards, who died January 5th, 1730 having a large Umbilical Rupture. Communicated to the Society by John Ranby, Esq; Surgeon to his Majesty&#x27;s Household, and F. R. S.

ABOUT six Years ago having some Difference with her Husband, he gave her a Kick on the Belly; and from that he complained of Pain, and a Swelling about the Navel, which in Time encreased to about the Size of a Man&#x27;s Head, seldom giving her any Uneasiness but by its Weight; and that chiefly when her Bandage was off, which she generally wore, except when her Diet, or any other Accident, brought on a Diarrhoea, which was always attended with Cholick Pains, particularly in the Rupture; to ease which she had been advised to iron it with a hot Iron, and had thereby so often burnt it, that there remained on the Skin several large Cicatrix&#x27;s. Three Days before her Death she was taken with the Diarrhoea, attended with a slight Fever.

On opening the Bag, the Cawl first presented, the greatest Part whereof adhered to the Peritoneum: On removing this, the Small Guts, to the Length of two Ells and a half, were contained in this Bag, together with all the Colon, except so much of it as is below the left Kidney; and the Beginning of the Colon, with
with the Coecum, were attached to the Mesentery, in such a Manner, as to be but two Inches distant from the Pylorus; which, with about one Third of the Stomach, was by this Means drawn into the Bag. The Beginning of the Duodenum just entered the Bag, and then returned out again; which with but a small Portion of the Jejunum, was the Chief that remained in the Abdomen.
