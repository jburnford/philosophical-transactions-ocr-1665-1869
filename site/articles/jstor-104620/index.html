Since a greater Portion of the Hemispheroid, into which the Sea is formed by the Moon&#x27;s Attraction, is then above the Horizons of these Places, than is below them. If this is found to be Fact, it will also be found, that the Duration in different Places (other things alike) will be in some measure proportional to their Latitudes, and the Declination of the Moon.

5. In an oblique Sphere, all Azimuth Circles cut the Equator and its Parallels obliquely; and therefore the Moon must come sooner to, or from, a given Azimuth, with one Declination than with another. In some Latitudes this Difference will amount to several Hours. Is it not then a false Rule to judge of the Times of high or low Water by the Moon&#x27;s Azimuth, or to signify one by the other, as is the Custom of Sailors?

XIII. Some Account of the Remains of John Tradescant&#x27;s Garden at Lambeth; by Mr. W. Watson F. R. S.

Read May 25. UPON a Visit made to Mr. John Tradescant&#x27;s Garden at South Lambeth, May 21, 1749. by Dr. Mitchell and myself, were observed the under-mention&#x27;d exotic Plants.

This Garden was planted by the above-mention&#x27;d Gentleman about an hundred and twenty Years since, and was, except that of Mr. John Gerard, the Author of
of the Herbal, probably the first botanical Garden in England. The Founder, after many Years spent in the Service of the Lord Treasurer Salisbury, Lord Wotton, &amp;c, travell&#x27;d several Years, and procured a great Variety of Plants and Seeds before not known in England; to several of which at this time the Gardeners give his Name, as a Mark of Distinction; as Tradescant&#x27;s Spiderwort, Tradescant&#x27;s Asters, Tradescant&#x27;s Daffodil. He first planted here the Cupressus Americanus Acacia foliis deciduis, which has been since so much esteem&#x27;d, and is now one of the great Ornaments of the Duke of Argyll&#x27;s Garden at Witton.

Mr. Tradescant&#x27;s Garden has now been many Years totally neglected, and the House belonging to it empty and ruin&#x27;d; and though the Garden is quite cover&#x27;d with Weeds, there remain among them manifest Footsteps of its Founder. We found there the Borrage latifolia sempervirens of C. B., Polygonatum vulgare latifolium C. B., Aristolochia clematitis recta C. B. and Dracontium Dod. There are yet remaining two Trees of the Arbutus, the largest I have seen; which, from their being so long used to our Winters, did not suffer by the severe Colds of 1729 and 1740, when most of their kind were kill&#x27;d throughout England. In the Orchard there is a Tree of the Rhamnus catharticus, about 20 Feet high, and near a Foot in Diameter, by much the greatest I ever saw.

It is not unlikely but there may be several other Plants yet remaining in the Garden, but flourishing at a different Time of the Year.

W. Watson.</div>
