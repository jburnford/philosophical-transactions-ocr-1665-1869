Page 19, to the end of the third paragraph relating to Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Chronology, add this Note:

I think myself bound, for the sake of truth, to say, that I was misinformed in what I have said here concerning Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Chronology; for I find since, that the five first chapters of that work had received his finishing hand; that he had resolved to publish it in his life-time; and that it was only the short Chronicle, which had been surreptitiously translated and printed in France. I am greatly obliged to the present Lord Bishop of Bangor for this intimation, supported by many curious particulars of what passed in conversation on that head between Sir Isaac and his Lordship.

Page 534. l. 11. dele the semicolon after vane, and insert it after broad. — p. 535. l. 23. insert a comma after agate, and dele that after likewise. — p. 536. l. 16. for fourth read fourteenth. — p. 602. l. 9. after contact add a colon; l. 11. instead of a semicolon after wood, insert a comma, and the semicolon after varnish&#x27;d. — p. 604 l. 29 for the other end acts read the other end of the last-mentioned bar acts. — 605. l. 19. for plate read place; l. 27. for $\frac{1}{2}$ read $\frac{1}{3}$. — p. 609. l. 3. for I read T; l. 19. for I read T. — p. 610. l. 1. dele A Table of; l. 2. for Col. 6. read Col. 7. after determined add as also that in No. 3 Col. 5.

In Tab I. between p. 610 and 611. in the Title of the Columns 9 and 12. for different parts read difference of parts.

In the same Table, Col. 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th, are sufficiently explained by the titles upon them in the Table. Col. 9th is the difference of the numbers in columns 3d and 7th, and expresses the differences of expansion of the basis and the bar measured, between the different degrees of heat expressed in the 10th column; which column consists of the differences between col. 4th and 8th. — Col. 11th is made by proportioning the numbers in col. 10th, to what they ought to be, upon the supposition of an uniform expansion, in case the difference of heat had been constantly 166 degrees of Fahrenheit. — Col. 12th, 13th, and 14th, are made in the same manner, from columns 3d and 5th, 4th and 6th, as columns 9th, 10th, 11th, are made from columns 3d and 7th, 4th and 8th. — Col. 15th is made by saying as 160° is to 66°, so is any number in col. 11th to its correspondent one in col. 15th; which, was the expansion quite uniform, or in the same ratio as that of quicksilver, ought to agree with col. 14th. — Col. 16th contains the differences of col. 14th and 15th, which are the irregularity of the expansion,
pansion, or the deviation of the numbers in col. 14th, from what they should have been, in case the metals had expanded equably. — N. B. If the numbers in col. 11th are added or subtracted, according to the signs in col. 9th, to or from the constant number 287.5, which is the expansion of the basis, this will give the real expansion of the bars in parts of the micrometer, by a difference of heat equal to 166 degrees of Fahrenheit; taken somewhat above freezing, and below the boiling heat.—The expansion of the basis for 66° above the lower heat before-mentioned is 114.5. This also is a constant number; from or to which if the numbers in columns 14th and 15th are added or subtracted, according to the signs in column 9th; the real expansions will be given for 66°; the first as it turns out from experiment, the other as it should turn out upon a supposition of equable expansion; but as the numbers so obtained from columns 14th and 15th will have the same arithmetical differences as the numbers in 14th and 15th columns have, the irregularity, in proportion to the whole expansion, will be very little; and in general so small that it may in a great measure be owing to some inaccuracy in making the experiments themselves.
