<div class="ocr-text">An Intimation of divers Philosophical particulars, now undertaken and consider&#x27;d by several Ingenious and Learned men; here inserted to excite others to join with them in the same or the like Attempts and Observations.

First, we have notice given us, that at Paris the Excellent Signior Cassini hath lately detected again Spots in the Sun, of which none have been seen these many years, that we know of. &#x27;Tis hoped that that learned Astronomer will shortly publish a Description of what he shall have observed of this kind. Mean time we cannot but acquaint the Curious, that, as far as we can learn, the last observation in England of any Solar Spots, was made by our Noble Philosopher Mr. Boyl, who, upon an occasional discourse of this Subject, was pleased to communicate what he had observed of this kind, as he found it registred in his Notes, viz.

Friday, April 27, 1660, about 8 of the clock in the Morning, there appear&#x27;d a Spot in the lower limb of the Sun a little towards the South of its Equator, which was enter&#x27;d about \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the Diameter of the Sun, itself being about \(\frac{1}{12}\) in its shortest Diameter, of that of the Sun; its longest, about \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the same. It disappear&#x27;d upon Wednesday Morning (May 9th) though we saw it the day before about 10 in the morning to be near about the same distance from the Westward limb a little South of its Equator, that it first appear&#x27;d to be from the Eastward-limb, a little South also of its Equator. It seem&#x27;d to move faster in the middle of the Sun than towards the limb. It was a very dark Spot almost of a quadrangular form, and was enclosed round with a kind of dusky cloud, much in this form and in this proportion to the Spot.
We first observ&#x27;d this very same Spot both for figure, colour and bulk, to be re-enter&#x27;d the Sun May 25th, when it seem&#x27;d to be in a part of the same line it had formerly traced; and was enter&#x27;d about $\frac{3}{33}$ of its Diameter about 7 of the clock in the afternoon. At the same time there appear&#x27;d another Spot, which was just enter&#x27;d and appear&#x27;d to be enter&#x27;d not above $\frac{1}{132}$ part of the Sun&#x27;s diameter. It appear&#x27;d to be longest towards the North and South, and shortest towards the East and West. There seem&#x27;d to be dispers&#x27;d about it divers small clouds here and there.

These Observations were made, as the Noble Observer told us, with an excellent Telescope, in the presence of divers Curious and Ingenious persons, one of whom was Mr. Hook. And discoursing of the thoughts he had entertain&#x27;d touching the Effects of such Spots, he suggested this Inquiry, Whether they might not cause a considerable alteration both in the Body of the Sun itself, and in our Air and the Bodies in it upon their dissipation?

Secondly, we understand, that at Paris the Royal Observatory, now a building for making Celestial Discoveries, is very far advanced, and will shortly be in a condition to be employed for the use intended; whence we may expect a considerable advancement of the Astronomical Science. In the same Edifice, which the said Observatory maketh a part of, we are inform&#x27;d that there is, besides many other rooms fit for Philosophical uses and purposes, a very deep Cave, having an hundred threescore and ten steps of descent; wherein many sorts of Experiments are intended to be made, being of that nature, that they require to be remote from the Sun-beams and the open Air; such as are Thermometrical ones, and such as concern Refrigerations, Coagulations, Indurations, and Conservations of Bodies, and a thousand things more.

Thirdly, we hear, that the Learned Monsieur Mariotte is publishing two very desirable Discourses, the one of Vision; upon which subject he hath discovered something new and considerable: the other of the Art of Levelling, wherein he delivers many remarkable particulars about Refraction, and the Errors, that may, upon the account thereof,
be imposed upon men; together with several New Instruments of Levelling exactly.

Fourthly, we find by Letters out of Germany, that the learn&#x27;d Physitian Dr. Kornmannus, is printing a Book concerning the Tinctures or Essences of the Excretions of Insects, which having fed upon several herbs and flowers, yield such dungs, wherein the tincture, colour and virtue of these vegetables are to be found: Thus for example, he can extract a curiously red tincture out of Excrements of Worms that have fed upon Roses, &amp;c.

Fifthly, we find by Letters out of Italy, that a very Ingenious person there, upon the consideration of what hath been lately intimated touching certain Experiments for finding out, whether there be a Circulation of Sap in Trees, resembling that of Blood in Animals; Offers it to the consideration of Naturalists, Whether it be likely to find a place in Vegetables, whence the Sap may part, and whither it may return, such as is the Heart in Animals; adding, that whereas Vegetables are always to put forth new branches, leaves, &amp;c. it seems to be sufficient for them, that there be a continual and plentiful course and supply of Juice, to thrust out every way, without any necessity of such a Circulation.

Sixthly, whereas it hath been more than once mentioned in these Papers; * Mulierum testes esse Ovario analozos; nec tantum in nuptis &amp; fecundis Mulieribus, sed etiam in Virginibus esse Ova vera, &amp;c. We cannot but signify here, for further inquiry, that there hath been very lately made by two Physitians at Paris a dissection of a Cow, in cujus testiculis ova reperta fuerint, uti Kerkringius observasse se scripsisset in Anthropogenia seu Ichnographia; and that there they intend to pursue this Inquiry, inviting others to make the same research. Wherein since the learned Dr. Walter Needham, an English Physitian, and a worthy Fellow of the R. Society, hath heretofore already been conversant to good purpose, it is here publicly wished, that he would make a further progress in the same; plures
Seaventhly, from Germany we are inform&#x27;d, that in the University of Jena in Upper Saxony, one Mr. Weigbelins, Professor of the Mathematicks there, hath invented several ingenious Instruments and Engins; As first, an Astronomical one, which he calls Astrodicticum, by the means whereof very many persons shall be able at one and the same time to behold one and the same Star. Secondly, An exceeding great Globe of the World, capable of ten persons to sit in it all at once, and to behold the motions of the celestial Bodies, &amp;c. Thirdly, An odd Bridge, or a kind of Stairs, by which a man shall descend and yet really be raised upward, and going as &#x27;twere upon a plain shall, from a lower, by gently subsiding, arrive to an upper story, &amp;c. Of these and other particulars, said to be in part already done, and in part design&#x27;d by the said Mathematician, we hope we shall in time obtain a more satisfactory account.

The Extract of a Letter written by Mr. John Ray to the Publisher from Midleton, July 3, 1671, concerning Spontaneous Generation; As also some Insects (melling of Musks)

Sir,

As to the particulars contain&#x27;d in your Letter, I well remember, that Mr. Lister did, a good while since, write me his opinion concerning Vegetable Excreencies, and the Insects therein bred and harboured; but the Letter containing that Discourse I have not at present by me, it being sent away in a bundle of other Letters and papers into Essex. I have therefore written to him to desire him to take the pains himself to send you his thoughts upon that subject.*

* The Reader is like to find this Account in the Translations of the next Month.

Whether there be any Spontaneous or Anomalous Generation of Animals, as hath been the constant opinion of Naturalists heretofore, I think there is good reason to question. It seems to me at present most probable, that there</div>
