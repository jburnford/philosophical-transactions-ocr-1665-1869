<div class="ocr-text">XXVIII. Thermometrical Observations at Derby, by Mr. John Whitehurst, communicated by Charles Morton, M. D. Sec. R. S.

Dear Sir,

We experienced a much greater degree of cold at Derby, in the late frost, than perhaps was ever observed in England; and the quick transitions were no less remarkable.

On Sunday the 18th of last month, at nine of the clock in the evening, my thermometer stood at 20. At half an hour after nine, nearly one degrew below 0. At seven the next morning, 30. external air.

I am, Sir,

Your most obedient servant,

Derby,
Feb. 15, 1767.

John Whitehurst.</div>
