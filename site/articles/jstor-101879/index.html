<div class="ocr-text">upon it with such a strength as will prevail against all that opposeth it, as I have shewn above.

To the fourth Difficulty I answer: That although the use of the Pipes be meerly for the conveying of Air: They may nevertheless easily be fill&#x27;d with Water when need requires, and so the defects in them may as well be found out as in the Pipes that are used for the conveying of Water. This is all I may answer at present, and I shall make an end with assuring Mr. Nuis that i&#x27;le make use of his advice when ever he will be pleased to give it me.

An answer of the same to the Author of the perpetual Motion.

In the last papers I published in Phil. Transact. N. 184 against this perpetual Motion described in N. 177. I intreated the Author to permit me to say nothing as to what alterations he might make in his Engine; resolving to leave it to others to shew him that upon that principle all he can do signifies nothing. But I find since, in the Nouvelles de la Republ: for December last, that he still persists to urge some new contrivances, which being added he conceives his Engine must succeed. To this I answer that I undertook only to shew that his first device would faile, which yet I should scarce have done, if I had thought a dispute of this nature could have lasted so long. To come therefore to the point, where he faith that this Engine may well succeed without alteration, because he hath tryed with Liquors put into Bellows immersed in Water: I again say that I grant him the truth of the Experiments, but deny the consequences he would draw.
draw from them, I have already given the reasons of my dissent, which this Gentleman is not pleased to understand. But to end all controversies he may please to consult Mr. Perrault, de la Hire, or any other at Paris well known to be skilled in Hydraulicks: and I doubt not but he will find them of the same opinion with Mr. Boyle, Mr. Hook and other knowing persons here, who all agree that our Author is in this matter under a mistake.
