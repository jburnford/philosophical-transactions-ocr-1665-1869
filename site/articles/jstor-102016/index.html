<div class="ocr-text">VI. An Extract of a Letter from Sir R. Bulkley concerning the Propagation of Elms by Seed.

THIS is to acquaint you that I have discoursed a poor meer Irish Labourer (who by having work&#x27;d many years under a Head Gardiner in a Gentleman&#x27;s Garden, has got a Genius of Planting) who has follow&#x27;d the Propagating of Elms by the Seed (a way, if known, totally neglected among all Planters) which Seed he finds in the former part of the Year; and he has rais&#x27;d in small Beds such vast numbers of them, that he sells them of three or four Foot long at Two Shillings a Hundred, and will carry them anywhere within Five Miles, and plant them into the Bargain.</div>
