<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">Cassini, in his Astronomy, mentions much such another Observation.

I likewise observed Two darkish Spots upon the Body of Venus; for the Air was exceeding clear and serene.

XXIV. An Occultation of Jupiter and his Satellites by the Moon, October 28. 1740. in the Morning; observed at Mr. George Graham&#x27;s, F. R. S. House in Fleetstreet, London, by Dr. Bevis and Mr. James Short, F. R. S.

The same Limb preceded Jupiter 1&#x27;. 31&quot;&#x27;. These were taken with a reflecting Telescope, 9 Inches

Jupiter&#x27;s subsequent Limb immersed. Jupiter&#x27;s First Satellite eclipsed by the Moon. These Immersions were taken with a Reflecting Telescope, of 16.5 Inches Focus, that magnified 120 times. Procyon passed the Meridian. The Sun&#x27;s Centre passed the Meridian. |

N. B. The Clock in the lower Room was all along 2&quot; slower than the Clock in the upper Room.

None
None of the Emersions could be seen for Clouds. Whilst Jupiter was immerging, the Sky was perfectly serene; and, at his nearest Approach to the Moon, he did not appear to alter his Figure in the least, nor to be tinged with any prismatic Colours; neither did he (as is said to have been sometimes observed through refracting Telescopes) seem to enter at all upon the Moon&#x27;s Body.

That Part on the Moon&#x27;s Limb where Jupiter entered, was a Hollow; and though some are of Opinion, that the Circumference of the Moon, as it is bounded to our Eye, is a perfectly smooth Circle, and that no Hills or Hollows appear there, as on the Surface of the Moon; yet if it be looked at in a clear Night with a good Telescope, that magnifies about 100 times, or even less, it will be seen rugged and uneven all round.

Notwithstanding Jupiter&#x27;s Light seems to be more vivid than that of the Moon, when he is seen at a good Distance from her, and far more so when the Moon is away; yet the contrary is plainly discerned when they are near one another: And in this Observation, whilst Jupiter was immerging behind the Moon, his Disk appeared much dimmer, and of a more faint and dusky Complexion, than the Disk of the Moon.</div>
