<div class="ocr-text">XXII. An Observation on the Planet Venus, (with regard to her having a Satellite) made by Mr. James Short, F.R.S. at Sunrise, October 23. 1740.

Directing a reflecting Telescope of 16.5 Inches Focus, (with an Apparatus to follow the diurnal Motion) towards Venus, I perceived a small Star pretty nigh her; upon which I took another Telescope of the same focal Distance, which magnified about 50 or 60 times, and which was fitted with a Micrometer, in order to measure its Distance from Venus; and found its Distance to be about $10^\circ.2&#x27;.0&#x27;&#x27;$. Finding Venus very distinct, and consequently the Air very clear, I put on a magnifying Power of 240 times, and, to my great Surprise, found this Star put on the same Phasis with Venus. I tried another magnifying Power of 140 times, and even then found the Star under the same Phasis. Its Diameter seemed about a Third, or somewhat less, of the Diameter of Venus; its Light was not so bright or vivid, but exceeding sharp and well defined. A Line, passing through the Centre of Venus and it, made an Angle with the Equator of about 18 or 20 Degrees.

I saw it for the Space of an Hour several times that Morning; but the Light of the Sun increasing, I lost it altogether about a Quarter of an Hour after Eight. I have looked for it every clear Morning since, but never had the good Fortune to see it again.

Cassini,
Cassini, in his Astronomy, mentions much such another Observation.

I likewise observed Two darkish Spots upon the Body of Venus; for the Air was exceeding clear and serene.

XXIV. An Occultation of Jupiter and his Satellites by the Moon, October 28. 1740. in the Morning; observed at Mr. George Graham&#x27;s, F. R. S. House in Fleetstreet, London, by Dr. Bevis and Mr. James Short, F. R. S.

The Sun&#x27;s Centre passed the Meridian in the Transitory.

The Moon&#x27;s illuminate Limb preceded Jupiter in Right Ascension 1&#x27;. 38&#x27;&#x27;. in time.

The same Limb preceded Jupiter 1&#x27;. 31&#x27;&#x27;. These were taken with a reflecting Telescope, 9 Inches</div>
