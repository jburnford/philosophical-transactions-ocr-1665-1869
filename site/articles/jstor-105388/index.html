Dear Sir,

Read Jan. 10, 1760.

Though in all probability you will have seen the comet, which is now apparent; yet, lest you should not, I was not willing to omit this opportunity of informing you of it. I received a message last night from Dr. Mason, who, as far as I find, was the first here, that discovered it. We did not suspect at first, that its apparent motion was so great, as it appeared to be on examination; or else should have taken more observations. Very luckily, however, I took its distance from four principal stars, between a quarter and half an hour after nine, which was as soon as I saw it; and, about an hour and a quarter after, finding that it had manifestly moved, to the naked eye, I took other observations of it, every quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, till very near two o&#x27;clock, when it ceased to be visible, on account of its being too low in the mud.

The first observations gave its distance from K Orionis, $3^\circ 29&#x27;$; from Rigel, $11^\circ 46&#x27;$; from Betelgeuse, $17^\circ 10&#x27;$; and from Syrius, $12^\circ 56&#x27;$. All these observations were made between a quarter and half an hour past nine, and, as well as I could recollect, in the order I have set them down; which, not imagining
gining it was material, I had not been careful to mark
to single minutes. At $1^h\ 22&#x27;$, its distance from Rigel
was $7^\circ\ 6&#x27;$; at $1^h\ 24&#x27;$, from Betelgeuse $15^\circ\ 53&#x27;$; and
at $1^h\ 36&#x27;$, its distance from Sirius was $17^\circ\ 36&#x27;$.

This will be sufficient for you to find its place by.
The observations, together with above twenty others,
were made with a little Hadley&#x27;s quadrant, and may
most of them, I believe, be depended on to about
two or three minutes; but some perhaps may err
four or five minutes.

I am, Sir,

Your obedient servant,

Cambridge, Jan. 9, 1760.

John Michell.

XLIII. An Account of the same Comet; by
Nicolas Munckley, of Lincoln&#x27;s-Inn, Esq;

Read Jan. 17, January 9, 1760, I observed what ap-
peared to me to be evidently a comet,
west of the constellation of Orion, or (to speak more
astronomically and exactly) over the two stars marked
$\mu$ and $\nu$ in the river Eridanus, but nearer the latter
than the former; right ascension, about 66 deg. de-
clination, about 3 deg. S. It was something dimmer
and larger than either of these stars; and through a
telescope, appeared magnified, and surrounded with
a broad, faint, ill-defined haziness, like the last
comet, such as plainly distinguished it from any</div>
