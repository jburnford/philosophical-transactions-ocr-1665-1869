<div class="ocr-text">supply the others defect: Which is very evident to be seen; for the Diaphragme being made useless by loosing its Nerves, the Intercofial Muscles do dilate the Ribs much more than formerly, even to the utmost distance they can, when there is need for it; as, when you make the Dog run a little after he is cut, or when you gallop a wind-broken Horse, doth manifestly appear.

3. The manner of Respiration being the same in a Dog, whose Diaphragme Nerves are cut, and in a Wind-broken Horse, &#x27;tis more than probable, that the Cause may be as nearly the same, as the Signs are; and that, though there may be other faults found in the Lungs of such Creatures, yet &#x27;tis very likely, they may be induced from the weakness of Respiration, but that they had their occasion from the Relaxation or Rupture of the Nerves of the Diaphragme at first; which will seem more credible, if we remember, that by the straining of the Midriff too much (by which the Nerves may be quite broken or stretcht beyond their proper tone) most commonly that accident happens.

Anatomical Observations on a Humane Body, dead of odd Diseases; as they were communicated by Dr. Nathanael Fairfax.

A Young Maid of Rumborough in Suffolk, when she was about thirteen years of Age, took Chalybeats for the Green-sickness, and found some relief by it, but was after much pent in her wind. From 16 to 22 she much afflicted herself for the Death of her Father and Mother, and the misbehaviour of a Brother; during which time, she had every year an acute Disease or two. At 18, she was very weakly, clogg&#x27;d in her Chest, and melancholy. If she went out in a windy day, she was fain to make haste in, for the Wind, she said, was ready to choak her. She was a very slow walker, going up Hill or up Stairs with much difficulty. She was now observed to be very thirsty, usuall drinking at Bed-time, and in the night too, sometimes; else, she said, she should be choakt with drought. Between 21 and 22 of her age, going down stairs, she heard a frightful jolking in her Breast; which she then made known to the rest of the house, who when she shew&#x27;d them the manner of it by shaking her Body, joyn&#x27;d all with her in the wonder, concluding (as most would have done by the noise) that her Breast was almost full of Water. She took several
veral things of Dr. Browne and others at Norwich for about six Months time, without finding Relief. Half a year after, toward Michaelmas, upon taking a slight cold, she was so stopp&#x27;d up, that she could only whisper; nor could she lie flat, but rear&#x27;d up with pillows. I being sent for, caused presently a Vein to be open&#x27;d, as an Expedient only to make way for a freer Circulation, and room for Nature to disburthen her self. Within less than an hour she got breath, and soon after grew as well as she was before. She affirm&#x27;d, she never sweat in her life, nor could it be procur&#x27;d by ordinary Sudorificks. Being desirous to add an Empirical remedy, I gave her three of Matthew&#x27;s Pills, which did sweat her lightly, but beyond what ever she remember&#x27;d. Several daily Doses of Lockier&#x27;s Pills, 4 per Dose, remov&#x27;d the juking, as she said, lower to the Midriff: when she, fearing an Hyper-catharsis, laid them by for two or three days, and then taking them up again, could find no further alteration by them. She could never lie on her left side. In the 23rd year of her Age, in Winter, she had a dangerous Fever, with a Diarrhea, but came off. In her 24th, in Winter again, she got cold, was quite stopp&#x27;d up, after five or six days fell into a Convulsion e&#x27;re she was bled, through want of care in those about her. By late bleeding he had present ease, and cheer&#x27;d up in the Evening, but died the next Morning.

I had leave from her self, whilst living, and from her Relations, when dead, to open her Body, which I did accordingly.

First therefore I cleav&#x27;d asunder the Breast-bone from the Cartilage, called Ensi-formis, to the Neck; when, laying open the hollow of the Thorax, there steam&#x27;d out at first a very offensive smell, notwithstanding the sharp frost there was at that time, it being about Christmas. Then making way to lay open either side of the Sternum, I was surprised to see (as I thought) almost the whole Cavity of the Thorax empty above, (as the Body lay supine) and filled with nothing but thick Milk beneath. But searching further, I found there was only all the right side of the Chest, and about a third part of the left, in that condition. It took up in the part to the Neck-ward a hand-breadth, and ran three fingers thickness to the left of the Mediastinum. The Liquor was like Cream, or rather like a size of Spanish white, having a cast of yellow like Beestings; for putting a spoon into it, from the bottom
bottom I took up a thick clammy matter, just like that Spanish white, that sinks to the bottom of its size. In quantity it might be about three Pints, contain&#x27;d in a Bag, which was capable to hold as much more and better. The bag ran along from the left shoulder, to the utmost of the right side of the Midriff; not straight along, nor stiffly stretcht, but about a hand-breadth from its rise it went directly down to the Midriff, with which it closed all along. Its skin or coat was thicker than that of the stomach, as well as its capacity larger, in as much as the Flexures of the Ribs joyn&#x27;d with it, and made up above half the compass. Where it adher&#x27;d to the Midriff, &#x27;twas near a finger thick: And in one place, where I endeavour&#x27;d to separate it from the Midriff, I hit upon a thinner Bag, whence issued out two or three spoonfuls of their water: How it got in, I found not. The Mediaslinum was either wholly wasted, or else woven into the thickness of the Bag, as was also the Pleura, as far as the Bag reach&#x27;d. It lay loose and flapping from the left Axillar to the Chest, having been before filled and distended either with Lend or the Liquor. All the hollow was bedabled with the wallowing of the Liquor about, as is the Ouse by the Ebbings and Flowings of the Tide in a Channel. That Lobe of the Lungs, which should have been on the right side, was gone, and that on the left, wasted to near a third part. In the Lower Belly all was well.

Dr. Brown saith, he hath met with the like in an Italian Author. His opinion was to salivate her. I had thoughts of a Paracenthesis, or Tapping between the Ribs; for by the noise of the Liquor, and by her not enduring to lie on the left, I concluded it must be in a Cyphus on the right. But if that had been done, the Bag being too thick might have mortified. The Jolking was exactly like that of Water or Milk. This Woman was as Flat-breasted as a Man. Whether the Liquor proceeded from the falling down of the Chyle from the Axillars, is a Quare, but seems to carry in it somewhat of probability. But I must not reflect.

Two other Anatomical Observations, imparted by the same hand.

1. A certain Serving-man about 27 years of age, died Hydropical, which Disease he was molested with 4 years before his death. He
was ever a listless, dull, and melancholy fellow, never cheerful nor smiling, especially for ten years before he died. His words came from him as if forced, and speaking but a little, he would end with a sigh. When open&#x27;d, he was found to have the left Lobe of the Lungs almost quite wasted; but no Ulcer, nor ought preternatural appearing in the remaining part, except its wasting. The heads of the Vessels and branches of the Wind-pipe as big as in the other Lobe. That Lobe of the Liver, which buts on the Mid-riff, was black outwardly for about a hand breadth, and about a thumbs breadth within the Parenchyma. Other parts sound.

2. The other day I took notice in the Corps of a Felon, that whereas ordinarily the Preparing Vessels arise on the right side, out of the Cava, as on the left, out of the Emulgent, his right Vas preparans sprang clearly from the right Emulgent.

Divers Instances

Of Peculiarities of Nature, both in Men and Brutes; communicated by the same.

1. One Mr. Morley of Bury St. Edmonds, in an Asthmatick distemper, was advised by some to take down a spoonful of good English Honey; which being done, the Patient fell into an Universal swelling, as if he had swallow&#x27;d the worst of Poisons. Mr. Goodrich being hastily called in to save life, prescribed him a common sudorific, which in competent time relieved him. They then made enquiry at the Apothecaries, Whether nothing were amis in the Honey? and they protestted, it was altogether right. But to be assured of it by Experiment, they afterwards got the like quantity at another place, which was given with the very same frightful event, and the party was cured by the same Chirurgeon (who is my Author) with the same kind of Sweat.*

2. Mr. Twisse, a Minister of Mettingham in Suffolk, about forty years of age, having been accustomed for some time to drink warm or rather hot Beer,

* The like Example hath been more than once related to the Publisher by a very credible person, of a Noble Lady in Ireland, who having received a small hurt on her Leg, and the Chirurgeon mingling in the Application, he made to it, a little Honey (from which she had an utter Aversion, which was then unknown to the chirurgeon, as was to the Patient the mixture;) the place affected did soon after rankle, and grow so bad, that the Lady was constrained to send for him that had applied it, who being examined about the Ingredients, and declaring one of them to be Honey, the Lady soon acquainted him with her Antipathy to that sublance; whereupon that Application was immediately removed, and another more proper for the Patient put in the place, with good success.</div>
