I have looked for this Light since, but could find nothing like it.

The Day was exceeding fine, and by my Journal I find, that,

At Noon, the Barometer was 29.98.
Thermometer 57.
Wind . . . East.
Decl. of the Needle 14° 10&#x27;.

At 10 at Night, Barometer 29.86.

XV. An Account of the Case of a Calculus making its Way through an old Cicatrix in the Perinæum, by David Hartley, M. A. F. R. S.

William Farman, of the Parish of Bayton in Suffolk, was cut for the Stone about 15 Years ago, and a large Stone taken from him.

The said William Farman says, that he continued easy for about four Years after he was cut; that the Wound was quite healed up, and that he made Water in the natural Way, without any Leakage at the Wound.

In July last, he says, he felt great Pain at the Place where he was cut, and that it was much swelled.
It looked black, and a little Hole broke open there; out of which the Water came; and a Stone appearing, the Hole grew wider by the Force of the Water, and his frequently touching it, till at last the Stone came away whole. It was broken afterwards by a Fall.

As soon as the Stone was come away he says that he grew easy, and the Swelling abated. The Wound is now reduced to a small Compass, and the Water still comes away through the Wound, and but very little Water comes out the natural Way.

William Farman is about 30 Years of Age. He says, that the great End of the Stone came away first, which he suffered to lie at the Mouth of the Wound near a Fortnight, but he applied to no Surgeon.

An Addition by the Publisher to the foregoing Case.

There they articulated or rubbed against each other, while in the Bladder; one having a round Head, the other a Cavity.
