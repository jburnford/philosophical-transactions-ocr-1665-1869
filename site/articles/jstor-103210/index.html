XXXVI. An Extract of a Letter from Francis Nevill, Esq; to the Lord Bishop of Clogher, F. R. S. concerning a Quarry of Marble discover&#x27;d by him in the County of Farmanagh in Ireland.

Belturbet, October 14. 1712.

My Lord,

Mr. Cole and I were lately in the Mountains, where I had discovered a Marble Quarry. The Country wherein it lies is so strange for the Natural Wonders in it, that &#x27;twould make a little History to describe all that is to be seen. It lies on the North-side of Calcagh, in the Parish Kilashier, and County of Farmanagh. There are Marble Rocks, whose Perpendicular
cular Height is fifty or sixty Feet, discovered by Subterraneous Rivers, which, by degrees, have wash&#x27;d away the Earth and loose Stones, and discovered these mighty Rocks. There are many great Pits fallen in on the sides of the great Mountain; several of them in a small Compass of Ground, so that it is dangerous travelling near them. There are many Caves form&#x27;d, some very large, the Sides and Arches of Marble; some of a Liver-colour, varied with white in many little Figures; some of a light Blue varied with White; but I could find no entire White or Black among them.

XXXVII. Remarks upon the Plague at Copenhagen in the Year 1711. Communicated by John Chamberlayne, Esq; F. R. S.

This Disease began to show itself first in this City, about the beginning of July, 1711. It increased &#x27;till the beginning of September; after which it diminished by little and little to the End of the Year, at which time it totally ceased.

It appears, that before this Distemper there were about Sixty Thousand Souls in Copenhagen: From whence they infer, that there is Born every Year about Two Thousand, and that there Dies nearly the same Number; which being Multiplied by Thirty makes Sixty Thousand.

In the Six Months which this Distemper continued, it is thought it carried off about 25000 Souls. It is true, the Publick Lists reckon but 22535; but it is agreed by all, that in the last Week of August, and the two first Weeks of September, each of which carried off above 1300</div>
