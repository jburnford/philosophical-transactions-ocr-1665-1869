Observations

Concerning Cochineel, accompanied with some suggestions for finding out and preparing such like substances out of other Vegetables.

It is generally believed, that the Cochineel comes out of a fruit called the Prickle-pear, bearing a leafe of a slimy nature, and a fruit blood-red and full of Seeds, which give a Dye almost like to Brasiletto wood, that will perish in a few dayes by the Fire: But the Insect engendred of this fruit or leaves, gives a permanent Tincture, as is generally known.

There grows a Berry (by report) both in the Bermudas and New-England, call&#x27;d the Summer-Island-Redweed, which Berry is as red as the Prickle-Pear, giving much the like tincture; out of which Berry come out first Worms, which afterward turn into Flyes somewhat bigger then the Cochineel-Flye, feeding on the same Berry: In which we read, there hath been found a colour no whit inferior to that of the Cochineel-Flye, and as to Medicinal vertue much exceeding it.

&#x27;Tis hereupon offer&#x27;d to consideration and tryal, 1. Whether this Bermuda-Berry might not grow in England? 2. Whether out of the Berry of Brasiletto-wood the like insect might not be obtained in respect of colour or tincture? 3. Whether a fading colour, yielded by certain Vegetables, might not be fixed by causing such a Fermentation in the Concrete, as may engender Insects giving the tincture of its original, which will hold in Grain?

For the obtaining of the last we find the following directions. Whereas Vegetables of Tincture are either Herbs, or Woods, or Berries and other Fruits; to breed Insects out of Herbes, dry them, (for so they yield the best tincture;) otherwise stamp them, and let them dry, till they will suffer no more juice to run from them, (this in the Sun or in a proportionable heat:) or if
if dried, infuse them with water in a heat for 24 hours; then vapour away the water till the dissolution be as thick as a Syrup (but for this use strain them not from their feces). Take this Mass, and put it into an Earthen or Wooden Vessel covered with some Straw or something else of that nature, that it lie not too close, and so proportion the quantity to the Vessel, that the Air may come about and into the Mass (yet not too much.) Then set this vessel in a ditch or pit made in the Earth in a shady place, and put about it some wet leaves or some such putrifying rubbish, and over it a board, and on that some straw or the like; and it will produce first a shelly husky Worm, and then a Fly of the Tincture of the Concrete, but durable and somewhat more advanc&#x27;d.

And as for Berries, stamp and boil them, evaporating them to the consistence of a Robe, and then use them as the former.

Lastly, for Woods, infuse them in water, being first pulveriz&#x27;d, and boil out their tincture, and then evaporate also the Water to such a thickness, as the other, and handle them in the like way. The Flyes will play about the sides of the Vessel and the surface of the matter, which taken are kill&#x27;d in a warm pan or stove, and so dried and kept.

Queries Concerning Vegetation, especially the Motion of the Juyces of Vegetables, communicated by some Curious persons.

1. What Vegetables there are, which, having the wrong end of them set downward into the ground, will yet grow; as &#x27;tis said Elders and Bryars will.

2. Whether the Branch of a Plant (as of a Vine or Bramble) being laid into the ground while it yet growing on the Tree, and there taking root, being cut off from the Tree while so growing, will shoot out forward and backward?

3. In tapping, cutting or boring of any Tree, whether the Juice, that vents at it, comes from above or below.

4. What part of the Juice ascends or descends by the Bark?</div>
