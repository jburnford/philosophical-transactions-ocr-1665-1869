Exemp. 2. Sit \( z = \frac{vy}{a} \), quia in hoc casu \( r = \frac{1}{2}, n = 1 \), ideo terminus ultimò abrumpens est \( \frac{raa \times 2n+1}{nxn+2xn+1} \times \frac{n-1}{y} = \frac{a}{4} \), unde \( q = \frac{a}{4} \) &amp; \( \frac{a}{2} \) ultimus terminus in \( \sqrt{2ay + yy} \) multiplicandus; adeoque

\[ ABD = \frac{vy}{2a} - \frac{av}{4} + \sqrt{2ay + yyx} - \frac{y^2}{6a} - \frac{y}{12} + \frac{3}{2}. \]

V. Part of a Letter of Mr. Robert Tredwey, to Dr. Leonard Plukenet, Dated Jamaica, Feb. 12. 1696, giving an Account of a great piece of Ambergriese thrown on that Island; with the Opinion of some there about the way of its Production.

I shall only at present let you know the Account I received from Ambergriese Ben, for so the Man is called from the vast Quantity of that valuable Commo-
dity he found Two Years ago; viz. One Hundred and Fifty Pound Weight dashed on the Shoar at a Place in these Parts called Ambergrise Point, where the Spaniards usually come once a Year to look for it. This vast Quantity was divided in Two Parts; supposed by rolling and tumbling in the Sea; but that which I have to inform you, is the Way how &#x27;tis produced; viz. from a Creature, as Honey or Silk; for I saw in sundry Places of this Body, the Beaks, Wings, and part of the Body of the Creature which I preserved some time by me, and this ignorant Fellow (for so you would term him if you knew all) has seen the Creature alive; and he adds, That he believes they swarm as Bees, on the Sea-Shore or in the Sea. This account is very different from what I ever met with, so I thought fit to Communicate it. We have lately discover&#x27;d Two hot Springs. One to Windward, which seems Sulphurous: The other to Leeward is very Salt; but as I am told does not partake of Brimstone, and both very much magnify&#x27;d for the Endemick Diseases of these Parts, the dry Belly-ach, Pains of the Nerves, and Yaws.
