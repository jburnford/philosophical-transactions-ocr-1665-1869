<div class="ocr-text">Observations of the apparent distances and positions of 458 double and triple Stars, made in the years 1823, 1824, and 1825; together with a re-examination of 36 Stars of the same description, the distances and positions of which were communicated in a former Memoir. By James South, Esq. F.R.S.

Read November 17, 1825.

The Royal Society having honoured the observations of 380 double and triple stars made by Mr. Herschel and myself with a place in the Philosophical Transactions, I am induced to offer for the like distinction a fresh series.

The Equatorial Instruments and Micrometers used on the present occasion, being precisely the same as those with which the preceding observations were made, the prefatory matter attached to the former communication, will be generally applicable to this.

As however some of the results have been obtained in England, and others in France, the place where each series of measures was procured, accompanies the date and instrument of observation.

From the 3rd of April, 1825, to the demolition of the Observatory at Passy, the micrometer of the Five-feet Equatorial was applied to the Seven-feet Instrument, in order to MDCCCXXVI.
Mr. South&#x27;s observations of the apparent distances

obtain the advantage of higher magnifying powers. By this change they stand in order 92, 157, 181, 327, 413, 513, and 787; the commonly used power being 181: a rigorous examination assured me, that the value of the one micrometer, was also the value of the other.

In the subsequent pages will be found observations of about 160 double and triple stars, hitherto (as far as I know) undiscovered: their apparent right ascensions and declinations are, I hope, generally accurate to the nearest minute: and should occasionally a greater error be detected, some indulgence will I trust be extended to me, for they were generally found at a considerable distance from the meridian, when extreme unsteadiness of the stars, and unwillingness to quit my observatory, rendered sweeping for new double stars my only mode of passing the night in it: as however they have been found on subsequent evenings from the data here given, no difficulty in identifying them, can reasonably be expected.

In the former Paper, 37 double and triple stars were selected as entitled to peculiar notice, these it was my intention to have subjected individually to a rigid investigation; owing however to the almost unprecedented bad weather of the last autumnal and winter months, 30 only of them could be re-measured; and the observations, which are here subjoined as an Appendix, although not so complete* as I could have wished, will still I hope be deemed not unimportant.

The arrangement is somewhat different from that pursued on the former occasion: instead of individual measures being

* The Appendix contains observations of thirty-six stars; six however of them offer no particular interest, and were measured inadvertently, under an idea that they were un-measured stars.
presented to public view, the mean result of each night&#x27;s work is here noted; but as the number of observations, and the differences between the extreme measures of each series are also specified, it is hoped that the alteration will be satisfactory to the Society.

As in these observations I have not had the powerful aid of Mr. Herschel, it has been my endeavour as far as possible to compensate for the loss; hence, instead of taking ten individual observations both of distance and position on the same night, and thereby considering the star measured, I have divided the work generally assigned to each star between two evenings, the better to correct any error which unfavourable state of atmosphere, inaccurate micrometrical readings, or particular bias of judgment might entail; and when the results have exhibited discordances greater than seemed justified by the difficulty of the observations, a third, or even a fourth night&#x27;s determination has been found useful.

To the observations contained in the former Memoir, peculiar interest was attached by the comparison of them with the results obtained by other astronomers; of which by far the most important were those derived from the labours of Sir W. Herschel; but as the observations which are recorded in the Philosophical Transactions are (from circumstances before * adverted to) of themselves inadequate to furnish the final results arrived at by that illustrious astronomer, it is grateful to me, and doubtless will also be to the Society, that the kindness of Mr. Herschel has supplied the necessary information; thus the existence of fresh connected systems is substantiated, and a degree of present importance conferred on the following pages, which he alone could bestow.

* See Phil. Trans. for 1824, Part III. page 20.
Mr. South&#x27;s observations of the apparent distances

The noble liberality of the Russian Government having recently put Mr. Struve in possession of an instrument much more powerful, and far more appropriate, for pursuing this department of astronomical* enquiry, than those with which his published observations were made, I have not deemed it right, as heretofore, to refer to his earlier, yet still valuable determinations, the general accuracy of which may well be cited as proofs of what industry and perseverance may achieve, although supported by comparatively slender instrumental assistance.

I have said that the accompanying observations were made partly at home, and partly abroad; the latter remind me of a pleasing duty:—the Board of Longitude of Paris, and Government of France, have claims upon me too great to remain unnoticed, the one for having requested, and the other for having acceded to me the permission of introducing into France, free of all duty (sans conditions), whatever astronomical instruments I thought proper;† and so effectual were the arrangements of the Director General of the

* The investigation of parallax by direct observations of double stars, not having yet been seriously entered upon, although recommended by Sir W. Herschel nearly fifty years ago, and the importance of it having been warmly pressed upon me by Monsieur le Marquis de la Place—a continuous series of observations of the most interesting double and triple stars seeming necessary—and fresh determinations of the orbits of Saturn&#x27;s satellites being wanted—it was my wish to have procured more extensive means than I possess, to have attacked the one, to have with greater facility followed up the other, and to have furnished the necessary observations of the satellites alluded to;—the overtures however for an object-glass of twelve inches diameter, and twenty feet focal length (Paris measure), with which I had proposed to construct an equatorial, similar to that of which an engraving is given in the former paper, were most unexpectedly arrested in limine, by Mr. Fraunhofer declining to supply me with one, unless accompanied by apparatus provided by himself—a useless augmentation of expense, which prudence therefore did not authorize me, to incur.

† The like indulgence was granted me for the importation of my ordinary baggage, travelling carriage, and for whatever I deemed necessary to render my sojourn in France comfortable.
Douanes, Mons. le Marquis de Vaulchier, and so extreme the politeness of the principal and subordinate officers of the Customs at Calais, that the importation and exportation of them, were affairs, not of difficulty, but of gratification.

It is needless to state, that on the establishment of an observatory by a private individual in a foreign country, many difficulties must be encountered. To Mons. Benjamin Delessert, whose liberality in promoting every thing which has science for its aim knows no bounds, I stand indebted, amongst other things, for whatever comfort my observatory afforded.

From the members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris I uniformly received every possible attention, whilst to Messrs. De la Place, Arago, Bouvard, Humboldt, and Poisson, a residence of fifteen months has placed me under obligations of no common order: they were received with pride, and are remembered with gratitude.

The Society have now before them, with few exceptions, a re-examination of all the identified double and triple stars described by Sir W. Herschel in the Philosophical Transactions; with the sentiments therefore of the illustrious author of the Mécanique Céleste I will conclude—&quot;Had the labours of Sir W. Herschel been confined to this department of astronomy, the discoveries he has made in it would have alone conferred upon him an imperishable name.&quot;

A diminution of distance of $2&#x27;&#x27;$ in so difficult a star is not very material; but a change of $8&#x27;&#x27; 6&#x27;&#x27;$ in the angle, accompanied by an alteration of the quadrant from $sp$ to $sf$ argues a sensible motion in one or both of these stars.

The change of position is not material; but with respect to the increase of distance, it may be remarked once for all, that there is great reason to suspect a considerable instrumental error in all the measures of that early period, exceeding $40&#x27;&#x27;$, the result being constantly (or most commonly) in defect, and that not unfrequently to a very large amount. The cause probably lies in the construction of the micrometer used;* and its effect is to throw a great uncertainty on the earlier distances of all stars of the 5th and 6th classes. Fortunately these are the least replete with interest. (H.)

The earlier measures of this star compared with the present offer a discordance.

It is therefore probable that the first measure might be in error, which from the extreme closeness of the stars might well happen. It should be re-examined some years hence. (H.)

The angle of $1781 (35^\circ 33&#x27; sp)$, is declared in the MS. observation to be too small by $6^\circ$ or $8^\circ$; and if we suppose the mean ($7^\circ$) to be the actual error, the corrected angle $42^\circ 33&#x27;$ agrees well enough with the present; so that no change need be presumed in this star.

I have often in England, and frequently since my abode here, attempted to observe this double star, but till now always unsuccessfully. The sky is nearly obscured by clouds, but the stars visible in the openings between the clouds are remarkably brilliant; they also pass through the field of the telescope extremely steadily: yet the wind is tremendously high. Notwithstanding these favourable circumstances the measures are attended with so much difficulty, that those of distance may perhaps be liable to an error of one, or even of two seconds.

This star B seems to have escaped the observations of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL, a circumstance which is rather singular, seeing that it is brighter than either of the more distant stars, whose situations relatively to $\zeta$ have been determined by him.—Is the star B variable in point of lustre? The stars between the clouds are magnificently bright, and are unusually steady, although the wind, which during the last thirty-six hours has been tremendously high, threatens every moment to carry away the roof of the observatory. The shutters are only separated from each other by a space equal to the diameter of the object end of the telescope.

To night I should certainly say that the nearest star B was not so distinct without illumination as either of the more distant stars, nor does it bear illumination so well as the distant star D; but still allows much more of it than C. Are any of the group variable? The angle of position of A B was this evening gotten with considerable difficulty. The night is very fine.

The centre piece of this instrument is spheroidal: the length of the horizontal or transverse axis, including the pivots, is 28 inches: on one end of this axis is a circle of 9.9 inches diameter, having a ring of silver soldered to its circumference, on which the dividing lines are drawn; the circle is provided with a level and two verniers; the scale of the former reading to 10 seconds, the latter to minutes only; it is intended solely as a finder, but will give the apparent altitude of a celestial object accurate to one minute.

Between this night and the 22nd of October, when the observatory at Passy was broken up, unfavourableness of the weather prevented me getting a second series of observations.

axis; the cones however of the horizontal axis being firmly soldered and pinned to a shoulder projecting from the centre-piece, are not separable from it: the level of the axis is supplied with a silver scale, each division of which is equivalent to one second. In the focus of the object-glass are seven equi-distant wires, the equatorial interval between any two of them being about 20 seconds of time: on each side of the meridian wire, and at equal distances from it, are two others, so placed that the pole star shall pass from it to either of them in two minutes, for a purpose explained in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society (vide Vol. I. page 238); applicable to each side plate, is an apparatus for regulating the quantity of light projected from the lamp upon the wires. The side plates are similar to those belonging to my Four-feet Transit Circle, and which (I believe) were described in Rees&#x27;s Encyclopaedia, when the instrument was the property of Mr. Groombridge. A second level for the horizontal axis, a spare one for the altitude circle, and a second wire-plate furnished with spiders&#x27; lines are at hand, and are ready for immediate use, should accident sustained by any of the first set, render them unfit for service—a reserve which no traveller should neglect; lest also any of the screws by which the various parts of the instrument are connected should be lost, a few additional ones placed in the box are not, (as I have found by experience), without their use.

The object-glass was made by Mr. Tullery, and originally belonged to the Westbury Circle: its clear aperture is 2.7 inches, its focal length is 43 inches; with a magnifying power of 300 it defines $\alpha$ Lyrae, Arcturus and Aldebaran, perfectly sharp and round; separates very distinctly the close stars of $\gamma$ Leonis, $\alpha$ Bootis, and $\zeta$ Orionis; whilst with 150 (the commonly used power) under favourable circumstances, the small star south preceding Polaris, is sufficiently visible to enable the observer to take its transit, with considerable precision.

The instrument is mounted on stone piers, and has retained its meridian position extremely well; fifteen months&#x27; experience has shown, that whilst the maximum error, to which the mean of a single series of observations of any star south of the zenith of my observatory, does not exceed 4-tenths of a second, often, very often, the result of a single set will not deviate 2-tenths from the true right ascension. When the pole star is steady, its transit over the wire may be determined to one second. Thus much for its utility.

As for its portability: the transverse axis, the telescope tubes, and the altitude circle, are included in a box 29 inches long, 14 inches broad, and 6$\frac{1}{2}$ inches deep. The three levels, the spare wire-plate, the light regulating apparatus, the lamp, &amp;c. are lodged in a case 27$\frac{1}{2}$ inches in length, 11$\frac{1}{2}$ in breadth, and 3$\frac{1}{2}$ in depth. The side plates, with their appendages of nuts, screws, &amp;c. are contained in a box 13$\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, 7$\frac{1}{2}$ inches broad, and 7$\frac{1}{2}$ inches deep; and the tout ensemble is well accommodated under the seat of my travelling carriage. (The measures are all exterior.)

* The tube first employed for this purpose was made of pasteboard: the dew however was frequently so copious that its figure became deranged, and it could with difficulty be re-applied to the object-end of the telescope. Under these circumstances, the veneered deal of which the English hat-box is constructed, afforded a material not liable to this inconvenience—its pliability rendered it easy to add one cylinder to another, so as to form a tube of any desired length, its weight at the same time very slightly disturbing the equilibrium of the telescope.

The small star will not bear even the slightest illumination. The night being unusually favourable, I was very anxious to procure, if possible, measures entitled to confidence; and finding all attempts with a power of 179 ineffectual, I applied 273: no advantage however was gained by the change of eye-piece. The observations of position must, I fear, be regarded with distrust, and any of distance with this instrument are altogether impracticable.

Mean Result.

Position $53^\circ 49&#x27; nf \pm (6$ Obs.); Distance about one minute and a half by estimation; Epoch 1825.04.

In 1781 the angle was $52^\circ 58&#x27; nf$. In 1802 it was measured at $54^\circ 8&#x27; nf$: the present is nearly a mean between them. It is clear therefore that no very sensible motion can exist in this star. According to the proper motions set down in PIAZZI&#x27;s catalogue, the angle of position should be liable to a slow change in the direction $np sf$ or $-,$ amounting however to a quantity hardly cognizable in 40 years.

There seems a sensible change of position in this star. In 1783 (Feb. 19) its angle was $16^\circ\ 24&#x27;\ sp$. The change amounts to $5^\circ\ 2&#x27;$ in the direction $sp\ nf$ or $+$, i.e. to $+0^\circ.123$ per annum. An increase also of $1&#x27;&#x27;.7$ in distance has happened. As the star is an easy one to measure in favourable weather, there is much probability that these changes are owing to real motions. (H.)

The distance at the beginning of 1783 was $29&#x27;&#x27;.30$, and the measure is called very exact; yet an increase of distance to the extent of $6&#x27;&#x27;.38$ is beyond probability, a circumstance which proves the occasional occurrence of the micrometrical error already pointed out, even in distances so low as $30&#x27;&#x27;$.

The night is tolerably good, but no measures of distance can be obtained. The stars, at the time of observation, were 50 minutes west of the meridian.

The discordance between the first and two subsequent series of observations of position, is very considerable; it would seem to indicate an error in the measures obtained on the 6th of January; against them there is however nothing in the shape of memorandum, to be found in the rough journal; on the contrary, the night of January the 6th was one of uncommon fineness. I have tried to re-observe this star several mornings during the present and the last months, but without success; indeed, except the weather is unusually favourable, the star, with my instruments, can scarcely be recognized as double.

The observations of position of this double star are by no means satisfactory. The two last sets agree sufficiently well, but differ to an enormous extent with the first series; yet the night of the 6th of January was remarkably favourable for delicate observations, and there is nothing prejudicial to their accuracy entered in the rough Journal. I have tried to re-observe this double star during the present autumn, but unfavourable weather has prevented me even from seeing it, as a double star. Passy; October 22, 1825.

In 1783 the position was $43^\circ 24&#x27; nf$, and a measure in 1802 gave $44^\circ 6&#x27; nf$ for the angle, so that no change of consequence can have taken place in this star. (H.)

A measure of the position of this star in 1783 gave $74^\circ 54&#x27; np$, which differs $6^\circ 58&#x27;$ from the present angle, being a change of $\pm 0^\circ.170$ per annum, a very considerable quantity for so distant a star. However, the great difficulty of the measures must make us cautious in ascribing this to a real motion. The distance presents no sensible alteration. (H.)

The position at the Epoch 1782.86 was $36^\circ\ 24&#x27;\ sp$.

During the observations of position, the haze took off the flare of the large star, and left the small one sufficiently distinct under a good illumination; after however the position series was procured, a dense fog supervened, the small star became very indistinct, and shortly was invisible; on this account, no more measures of distance could be obtained, and those gotten are deserving of little confidence.

The positions of B and C respectively in 1781, were $43^\circ 51&#x27; sf$, and $11^\circ 19&#x27; sf$, the former indicating a change of $8^\circ 7&#x27;$, and the latter of only $2^\circ 7&#x27;$. The distances have undergone little change.

Here the fixity of the more distant star may be regarded as affording presumptive evidence of a motion in the nearer one, and that to a considerable amount ($+0^\circ.202$ per annum, or direct.) This star therefore merits attention. (H.)

In 1783 the position is stated (MSS.) to have been $2^\circ 36&#x27; np$, and the distance $13&#x27;&#x27;.41$. In 1802 the angle was measured at $3^\circ 56&#x27; np$, but (for reasons assigned), this was regarded at the time as a manifestly false measure, and the small star was judged to be exactly preceding. The total change of angle is $4^\circ 14&#x27;$, a considerable quantity for mere error of observation in a star of the 3d class, and which (when the observation of 1802 is considered), may lead to a suspicion of a very slow relative motion.

The night is remarkably fine, and the stars are extremely steady; still the measures of this double star are so excessively difficult, that the observations of it, although made with every possible care, may be liable to error. To attempt to measure it, except under the most favourable circumstances, will always be useless.

I had often looked attentively for this small star, both here and in England, fully persuaded from the authority of Mr. Struve* that it existed; but till this evening, it does not appear from my Observatory Journal, that I have even once suspected that I saw it.

These are pale, ill defined stars, bearing neither illumination nor magnifying power: till now I have only seen it as a single star: finding the measures difficult with 179, I tried 105; but although the stars were then distinctly separated, the instant sufficient light was admitted to render the micrometer wires perceptible, both stars became invisible. The measures (perhaps little better than cautious estimations) were gotten with the ordinary power of 179. The night is particularly favourable.

I have tried to re-measure this double star several times; but although the weather has occasionally been very fine, I have not succeeded in seeing it double.

These stars are of a light blue colour; they are very close, bear but very little illumination, and are not well defined under sufficient magnifying power, to separate their discs completely from each other. The first set of angles taken this evening were gotten with 273, but the attempt to observe the distances with that power, was altogether ineffectual. The night is very favourable.

At the Epoch 1783.25 the position of this star was found 14° 0&#x27; nf. The change in 41.23 years amounts to 9° 1&#x27;, being at the rate of + 0°.219 direct, or in the direction nf sp. This change is too great to arise from mere error of observation; so that there is considerable probability of this turning out a binary star, and it ought therefore to be kept in view. (H.)

A considerable change seems to have taken place in the

were: Position $64^\circ 12&#x27; sf$; Distance $44&#x27;&#x27;.93$. The difference,
$6^\circ 15&#x27;$, is much more than could be fairly attributable to error

This star has undergone a change of position so considerable, as to entitle it provisionally to a place among the binary or connected stars. At the Epoch 1782.87, an observation of Sir W. Herschel, noted as &quot;very exact,&quot; makes the position $77^\circ 24&#x27; sf$. The change is $-10^\circ 30&#x27;$ in $41&#x27;&#x27;.72$, giving an annual motion of $-0&#x27;&#x27;.252$, in the direction $np sf$, or retrograde. This star therefore merits the assiduous attention of astronomers. (H.)

There is a notable alteration perceivable in the position of this star.

The change of position amounts to $-6^\circ 50&#x27;$, being $-0&#x27;&#x27;.166$ per annum, retrograde. Future observations must decide on the reality of this motion, and whether this is entitled to more than a provisional place among the Binary stars. (H.)

The night, which had been remarkably fine, cloudless, and unusually favourable for delicate observations, on account of the extreme steadiness of the stars, which enabled me to keep them bisected by the wires as long as I pleased, suddenly became bad; a dense fog in less than five minutes after the instrument was placed upon this star, rendered all the stars, Jupiter and Saturn, invisible; the Moon&#x27;s place also was scarcely to be distinguished. It has frozen all day: the thermometer in the shade stood between $29^\circ$ and $31^\circ$: it now indicates $28^\circ$. The instrument is covered with hoar frost, and the fog is so severe that I cannot see across the garden, a distance from the observatory not more than 100 feet.

Mons. Bouvard present. Night favourable.

Whether the Seven-feet Equatorial will enable me to measure this close double star I do not know; the highest power that can be applied to its present micrometer is 273, which is certainly inadequate to show the star double.*

The past has been a night such as rarely, very rarely occurs; from five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon till now, (four o&#x27;clock in the morning,) the stars have been unusually tranquil, and most exquisitely defined. At the commencement of the observations the Thermometer in the observatory stood at 31°, and it has gradually fallen to 23°.

crystallisation on the exterior surface, have been so considerable, although an attached deal tube projects twelve inches beyond it, that I have been obliged to remove it very frequently; but no trouble is too great to obtain measures, under circumstances so peculiarly favourable. Twenty stars have been observed, amongst them several of the most difficult, and some which I have never before seen double. Now however the dew is not confined to the parts of the telescope in the neighbourhood of the object-glass, but has attacked the wires of the micrometer; they have a serrated appearance; and I suspect begin to &quot;fiddle.&quot; Prudence advises me to relinquish observing, lest by persevering they should become broken. Many nights since my abode here, the dew has been far more copious, than I ever observed it to be in England; frequently the water has dripped off the instrument for several successive hours, but I never had any reason to suspect the slightest precipitation of moisture on the micrometer wires. The polar axis and object-end of the telescope, which in the earlier parts of the night were covered with hoar frost, are now coated with ice.

These stars will bear neither illumination nor magnifying power. With 181 nothing could be obtained worth transcribing; and 157 was tried unsuccessfully. The observations were made with 92, the lowest power I have; and were attended with such extreme difficulty, that I regard them as little else than approximations.

Sir W. Herschel states the position of this star on the 20th August 1783 at $54^\circ 27&#x27; sf$, and its distance at $1&#x27; 27&#x27;&#x27;.73$. This is indeed a surprising change in a star of the 6th class, and which can hardly be real. It is more than probable that a mistake of a revolution ($22\frac{1}{2}^\circ$) in the reading off of the micrometer took place in the earlier measure, which would conciliate the results within about $3^\circ$. Piazzi&#x27;s catalogue assigns no proper motion to this star. (H.)

great inequality and closeness of the two stars, single measures cannot be regarded as of any weight; hence no certain conclusion can be drawn respecting its motion or rest. The distance however seems to have increased materially, as $5&#x27;&#x27;.391$ is much too great for a star of the first class; and in 1783 the interval between the discs was stated at from 1 to $\frac{13}{4}$ diameter, according to the power used.

The small star is so excessively indistinct, that the measures, especially those of distance, must only be regarded as approximations.

The star here observed is indisputably 38 Ophiuchi. I had re-measured 36 Ophiuchi for it in Blackman-street twice during the summer of last year; not having found any other double star in the neighbourhood. On comparing however my observations with Sir W. Herschel&#x27;s, it was evident that we had not measured the same star; and by close attention the small star of 38 Ophiuchi was perceived. My first attempts to determine the distance proving unsuccessful, cautious estimation regarded it as 5 or 6 seconds: the night however having somewhat improved, the above observations of it were

If the star here measured be really the same with I. 35, its distance must be much increased. $7&#x27;&#x27;.137$ is a great distance, for a star even of the 2nd class. In 1783 it is described as having the interval of the discs only $\frac{1}{4}$ diameter of the large star, which, for a star of the 8th magnitude, could hardly correspond to more than $4&#x27;&#x27;$ from centre to centre. The angles, it is true, agree—that given by Sir W. Herschel in 1783 being $60°\ 48&#x27; np$, differing only $2&#x27;$ from its present value. This star requires further observation. (H.)

* This star is 30 Scorpii, and it is the only star in the neighbourhood which is likely to be mistaken for 38 Ophiuchi.

This star so much resembles the last measured double star (No. 708), that on observing it in the field of the telescope, I thought I had perhaps neglected to alter the direction of the instrument.

The night is very favourable for difficult observations; but although the stars are very steady, yet the measures are so extremely difficult, that I fear they merit but little confidence. Sir W.

The small star is pale blue, and is rendered more distinct by slight illumination; yet the measures are so excessively difficult, that it is useless to attempt observing it except under the most favourable circumstances, such as the present, when the stars generally are remarkably brilliant, and when they pass through the field of the telescope as steadily as possible.

Sir W. Herschel has no measures of the positions of these stars. The distance of A B he makes $11&#x27;&#x27; 4&#x27;&#x27;$, agreeing pretty well with the present; while that of A C is stated by him at $59&#x27;&#x27; 49&#x27;&#x27;$, a convincing proof of some cause of error in the micrometer when opened to considerable distances, and which has been already alluded to. What this cause of error may have been, whether parallax, or the resistance of a spiral steel spring straining the threads of the screw immoderately, it is useless now to enquire; but the whole tenor of the observations goes to prove, that distances less than 20 or 30&#x27;&#x27; are not affected by it.

The position of 1781 is $87^\circ 14&#x27; sp$, differing $8^\circ 53&#x27;$ from the present; an extraordinary change for a star of the 6th class, and one so easy of measurement. In PIAZZI&#x27;s catalogue, a proper motion of $-0&#x27;&#x27;.03$ in R. A. and $+0&#x27;&#x27;.18$ in declination is ascribed to the large star. This should carry the large star almost directly away from the small one (and indeed there is an apparent increase of $6&#x27;&#x27;$ in the distance, could the earlier measure be relied on); but no sensible change of angle could thus arise. This star should be re-measured after a lapse of 20 or 30 years. (H.)

Measures of B C.

Passy; August 1, 1825; Seven-feet Equatorial.

When the eye is directed to another part of the field, the southern star (B) is seen also double; but its small star is so extremely faint, that to obtain any thing like measures of accuracy is impossible.

Position = $17^\circ.0&#x27; \pm nf$; Distance = 13 seconds (by estimation).

Passy; September 2 1825; Seven-feet Equatorial.

The star B is certainly double of the 2d or 3d class; but its small star, which is $nf$, is so excessively obscure, that no observations of it can be procured. Night fine; stars steady.

The measures are so extremely difficult, that the results are I fear little better than guesses. 210 (Bode) Cygni is in the field; is more easily measured than this star; and, by very cautious estimation, the distance between the two stars of $\omega^3$ Cygni is less than that of the two stars of 210 (Bode) Cygni, by six or seven seconds.

In 1783.33 the position was found to be $78^\circ 42&#x27; np$, so that an angle of $+6^\circ 17&#x27;$ seems to have been described since that epoch, or $+0^\circ.128$ per annum. This star then should be re-examined after an interval of 10 or 20 years, to ascertain whether the presumed motion be real, or not. (H.)

A cloudless sky; but the stars are extremely unsteady and ill defined; added to these circumstances, a small portion of the object-glass (perhaps one-eighth) is rendered useless by the unfortunate situation of the timbers of the observatory.

The observations of position agree well enough; but it is otherwise with those of distance. The night of August the 20th was much more favourable than either of the nights on which the star was subsequently measured; and as the mean of the distances procured on those nights will differ but little with that obtained on the 20th, if we take the three sets we shall probably not err much when we give as the

The extreme obscurity of the small star precludes M. Gambart getting any observations of distance.

The measures deemed by all observers, excessively difficult; night tolerably favourable, yet a higher power than 181 cannot be employed.

The discordance between the position of this double star, as determined on different nights, is enormous; a circumstance much to be regretted, as it appears to have undergone a considerable change since Sir W. Herschel&#x27;s observations.

The angle of $1783.73$ was $46^\circ 24&#x27; nf$. Hence it appears that in the interval of $41.93$ years no less an arc than $-10^\circ 45&#x27;$ has been described, giving a mean annual angular motion of $-0&#x27;&#x27;.2564$. This star then well merits the attention of future observers. (H.)

This star appears to have sustained a very extraordinary change both in distance and position. Sir W. HERSCHEL&#x27;s measures are as follows:—1781.80 (Oct. 22) Pos. $11^\circ 39&#x27; nf$, Dist. $19&#x27;&#x27;.533$. Thus in 43.46 years no less an arc than $-36^\circ 24&#x27;$ has been described, being at the rate of $-0&#x27;&#x27;.838$ per annum, and a change of distance to the amount of $+6&#x27;&#x27;.707$, or $+0&#x27;&#x27;.154$ per annum.

An observation in a 20-feet sweep in 1785 confirms the fact of the angle made by the two stars being then small. &quot;δ Equulei, double, very unequal, a few degrees nf. S.r.&quot;
No. D CCLXXXII. continued.

The star is a remarkable one; and from its magnitude and situation in the heavens, not to be confounded with any other.

The proper motions assigned to this star in Piazzi&#x27;s Catalogue, account satisfactorily for the change observed. They are respectively $+0&#x27;&#x27;.08$ in R.A. and $-0&#x27;&#x27;.29$ in declination. These motions, in 44 years, would carry the large star $3&#x27;&#x27;.5$ to the following, and $12&#x27;&#x27;.8$ to the south side of its place in 1781, or, in a direction, making an angle of $74^\circ sf$ with the parallel. Supposing then the small star fixed, the present angle of position and distance should be $47^\circ nf$ and $22&#x27;&#x27;.5$ instead of $48^\circ 3&#x27;$ and $26&#x27;&#x27;.24$ which observation makes them. If we consider the uncertainty which necessarily hangs about the earlier distance, depending as it does on a single measure, and from the extreme minuteness of the small star, liable easily to an error of 2 or 3&#x27;&#x27;, it will be allowed that a more satisfactory verification of the proper motion of the one star, and the comparative fixity of the other, could hardly have been looked for. This, among other similar instances, will serve to show the advantage which may be taken of the measures of double stars in all researches relating to the proper motions of the stars. This star appears to be a fit object for the investigation of parallax. (H.)

These measures compared with those of 1783 give a change of $-3^\circ\ 51&#x27;$ in angle and $+0&#x27;&#x27;.3$ in distance for the nearer star B, and $-4^\circ\ 54&#x27;$ and $+0&#x27;&#x27;.77$ for the more distant one C. If these changes arise from real motions, and be not merely errors of observation, they cannot be accounted for by supposing the stars B and C at rest, and the central star A only in motion. (H.)

Sir W. Herschel&#x27;s observations of this star (if II. 94) are as follows:

1783.66, Position 34° 24&#x27; np; 1802.5, 35° 56&#x27; np.

These compared with the present, present a great disagreement. If we take the mean of the two earlier observations we get 35° 10&#x27; np, and 1793.1 for a mean epoch, which compared with the measures of 1825 give an arc of 6° 42&#x27;, described in an interval of 33 years, or about + 0°.203 per annum. The data, it is true, are precarious, but the conclusion is such as to render it worth while to watch this star in future. (H.)

* This star was found by sweeping in the neighbourhood of the 784th star of Struve&#x27;s Catalogue. The star however whose place is there given, was only seen as a single star: it is therefore very probable that the one here measured is Sir W. Herschel&#x27;s star.

In 1821.9 the angle was measured at $7^\circ 9&#x27; nf$. The motion therefore in 3.9 years appears only to have been $0^\circ 14&#x27;$, direct, whereas computing on the annual motion $+0&#x27;&#x27;.5133$ it should be $2^\circ 0&#x27;$. The observation of 1821 is a mean of not more than 7 single measures. It is possible therefore that it may be somewhat erroneous, though probably not to the whole extent ($1^\circ 46&#x27;$) which this discordance would require; yet a trifling error in the present measure or in the angular velocity would reconcile all. Meanwhile the main point, the direction of the motion, agreeing, may be regarded as confirming the result already arrived at. (H.)

This star was measured under the idea that it was an unobserved star.

Our measures in the former paper are for the position of
A B. $39^\circ 29&#x27; sf$; of B C. $10^\circ 41&#x27; sf$; of AD. $67^\circ 20&#x27; np$;
1822.09; and for the distance,
of A B. $6&#x27;&#x27;.862$; of B C. $3&#x27;&#x27;.243$.

The distances ascribed to A B disagree, it is true, more than
a second, a very considerable quantity on so small a distance,
it must be confessed. It is probable that the real distance is
a mean between them, or $7&#x27;&#x27;.42$.

There is a considerable change in the position of the close star since the year 1823. At that time (1823.28) the angle was \(68° 39&#x27;\ sf\) (See Phil. Trans. 1824. Part III.) Hence it appears that the small star has continued its motion in the direction there assigned to it; and, if we may confide sufficiently in both data, with an accelerated velocity, for the computed motion corresponding to an interval of 2.0 years would be \(-1°.148\), whereas the observations make it \(-4° 18&#x27;\) or \(-4°.3\). Meanwhile the direction of the motion is as predicted, and we may therefore regard the reality of this star&#x27;s rotation as fully confirmed. (H.)

Note; In taking the mean, the ten observations of February 18 are considered equivalent to the seven of which the other sets are composed.

These measures, compared with those recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for 1824, afford, in the short interval of $2y.12$, a very satisfactory verification of the quantity as well as of the direction of the motion there assigned. The angle at that epoch ($1823.11$) was $5^\circ\ 1&#x27;\ s.p$. It is now $6^\circ\ 42&#x27;\ s.p$. The motion then is $-1^\circ\ 41&#x27;$ or retrograde, as it ought to be. Now, if we compute the motion on the supposition of the actual angular velocity being (as there assigned) $-0^\circ.777$, we shall find $-1^\circ\ 38&#x27;$, differing insensibly from the observed quantity. That this degree of exactness is not quite accidental, other similar instances to be adduced will convince us. (H.)

When this star was observed in Blackman-street, in 1824,
and again at this place in January of the present year, I re-
garded it as a new double star, and registered the observa-
tions of it as such; a comparison however of the results with
the measures of ζ Cancri, leaves no room to doubt that the
two stars are identical. Our former measures were Position
68° 17′ sf; Distance 6&#x27;&#x27;.241; Epoch 1822.14. Observations
however which immediately follow, show that the larger
star is itself double; hence some suspicion as to the accuracy
of these and of former measures will naturally arise.

The eye-pieces adapted to the micrometer hitherto used

the micrometer of the Five-feet Equatorial,* which I had for-
tunately brought with me from England: the powers thus
obtained are 92, 157, 181, 327, 413, 513 and 787. As to the

The angle thus obtained may be liable to an error of one or two degrees, for I see the large star unquestionably elongated; but the eye-piece now in use is the deepest magnifier which is adapted to this micrometer, and it is inadequate to separate the stars sufficiently to enable me to procure measures of them. At the time of perceiving the star elongated, I was unaware that it had been observed by Sir William Herschel as a close double star, as also that Mr. Herschel and myself, when we observed it in England as double of the 3rd class, had noted that &quot;it is not to be seen triple, although beautifully defined and round.&quot; Vide Observations of the apparent Distances, &amp;c.

Note. The observations of A C, when the star A was only seen as a single star, are rejected.

This star presents the hitherto unique combination of three individuals, forming, if not a system connected by the agency of attractive forces, at least one in which all the parts are in a state of relative motion. To begin with the two nearer stars A and B. Sir W. Herschel&#x27;s measure of their position Nov. 28, 1781 ($1781.90$) was $86^\circ\ 32&#x27;\ n.f.$ and it will be remarked, that a position so nearly perpendicular to the diurnal motion carries in some measure its own verification with it, as not liable to gross error. This differs no less than $54^\circ\ 22&#x27;$ from the present angle in the same quadrant, giving a mean annual motion of $+1^\circ.254$ or direct ($n.f\ s.p$). The distance remains as it was, so close as to be barely separable. In 1802 it was so also; but at that time, though observed by
and positions of 36 double and triple stars, &amp;c.

Sir W. Herschel, no measures could be procured, which is much to be regretted.

The evidence for the motion of the more distant star C will be found in the Philosophical Transactions, 1824, Part III. p. 115. The change of quadrant—the great amount of the motion ($23^\circ\ 42&#x27;$ in $40\frac{1}{4}$ years) and the circumstance of an error to that amount, or anything like it, being perfectly impossible from the considerable distance of the stars; add, too, the regular gradations by which the change appears, from several intervening observations, to have taken place; all these considerations place the motion of the distant star beyond dispute, and the present measures confirm it, the angle $67^\circ\ 55&#x27;\ sf$ compared with that of $1822\ (68^\circ\ 17&#x27;\ sf)$ indicating a motion still in the same direction. Its amount, it is true, is only $-22&#x27;$ instead of $-1^\circ\ 44&#x27;$ which the assigned velocity would give, but this is as near a coincidence as we have a right to expect in such small quantities.

If this be really a Ternary system connected by the mutual attraction of its parts, its perturbations will present one of the most intricate problems in physical astronomy. The difficulty will not be diminished by the circumstance of the rotations of the two small stars about the large one being (apparently at least) performed in opposite directions, being the reverse of what obtains in our planetary system, or by that of the deviations of the relative angular velocities from Kepler&#x27;s law, being such as to indicate either great masses in all the three bodies, great eccentricities in their orbits, or a different law of gravity from what obtains in our system.

The position here given compared with that of 1822.16 (Philosophical Transactions 1824, III.) indicates a change of only $-0^\circ\ 17&#x27;$, being smaller, it is true, in quantity than the change ($-1^\circ\ 35&#x27;$) which ought to have taken place on the supposition of the angular velocity of $-0^\circ\cdot514$ there assigned, but in the right direction. If we recollect that the angle of 1822 is deduced from a mean of only 8 individual measures, it will not appear surprising that an error of a degree or somewhat more should have been committed in it. In such a case the coincidence of directions is in itself a confirmation as good as we have a right to look for. (H.)

This position, compared with that of 1822.44, gives a motion of $+2^\circ\ 53&#x27;$. The supposition of an annual motion of $+0^\circ.30$, assigned in the former Paper, would give $+0^\circ.54&#x27;$. The present observations therefore confirm this motion fully in point of reality, and direction, but indicate an acceleration which (considering the number of observations) may have some claims to probability. The distances disagree more than might have been expected. (H.)

Nothing can be more satisfactory than the confirmation these observations afford of the rapid motion ascribed to this remarkable star. In the interval of 1.97 year since the Epoch 1823.29 the motion has amounted to no less than $13^\circ\ 55&#x27;$, in the direction $n p s f$, or $-7^\circ.025$ per annum. The sudden diminution of velocity is however not confirmed. Indeed it rested on too short an interval, and on too few observations (for such very close stars) to deserve great confidence. We cannot do better than recommend this star for the next 10 or 20 years to the constant and careful measurement of astronomers; nor can we too strongly inculcate here the indispensable necessity of multiplying extremely their measures of position, to eliminate those errors of judgment to which the most experienced observers are liable in measures of this sort. This done, there is no doubt of our arriving at a precise knowledge of the elements and position of the orbit described by each about their common centre of gravity; and the question of the extension or non-extension of the Newtonian law of gravity to the sidereal heavens—the next great step which physical astronomy has yet to make—will be effectually decided.

Taking the means of the above angles and epochs, allowing each a weight proportional to the number of measures on which it rests, we get for the mean Epoch 1825.34 the angle of position $54^\circ\ 26&#x27;\ np$. This, compared with the measures of 1822, gives $\pm 1^\circ\ 27&#x27;$ for the observed motion in the interval of 2.79 years. The motion computed on a supposition of $\pm 0^\circ.4378$ per annum assigned in a former paper, should be $\pm 1^\circ\ 14&#x27;$, differing insensibly from that actually found by observation. The motion of this star is therefore very satisfactorily confirmed both in direction and quantity; and when we reflect on the extreme difficulty of it (in respect of position), this will serve to give great confidence in results which depend on a great number of measures, however wide of the mark individual measures may be.

In the former communication (Phil. Tran. 1824. III.) it is remarked that the continuance or decrease of the then angular velocity of about $1^\circ$ per annum for a few years, would decide the question of rectilinear or orbital motion. The present observations, then, go a great way towards deciding this interesting question, as, so far from indicating any retardation, their tendency lies the other way. In fact, (supposing them free from error), no less than — $3^\circ\ 54&#x27;$ have been described in 2.74 years, being at the rate of — $1^\circ.420$ per annum. This star therefore merits peculiar attention, as the great variation of its distance gives reason to suppose a great ellipticity, or considerable inclination of its orbit. (H.)

Either there is a considerable error in these or the measures of 1821, or the result is unfavourable to the motion assigned to this star, as, instead of advancing $3^\circ$ in its apparent orbit, it seems actually to have receded nearly $50&#x27;$.

In the former communication $\xi$ Scorpii was only observed as a double star; Sir W. Herschel however having described it as triple, I have examined it several times with reference to this point; but the extreme unsteadiness of the stars, particularly those of low altitudes, during several weeks past, has precluded the use of high magnifying powers. This evening the stars being more tranquil, a power of 327 was applied, and an elongation of the large star was at times suspected: 413 confirmed the suspicion, but was inadequate to separate the two stars. The angles here given were obtained with 513, with which the discs of the stars seemed in contact; but their extreme unsteadiness under this magnifying power rendered all attempts to procure measures of distance abortive; and the position, from this circumstance, must be regarded with some distrust. The stars have the same colour, and were observed on the meridian.

The change in this star since the last observations is such as to confirm the direction of its motion; but the quantity is more than calculation would give, amounting to no less than 6° 13&#x27;, instead of 1° 6&#x27;. This renders it probable that the measures of 1823 are erroneous,* and that Mr. Struve&#x27;s measure in 1820 (46° 33&#x27; np) is entitled to greater confidence. The former rest on the observations of one night; and long experience has now shown, that this can never be fully depended on. (H.)

The small star only seen by glimpses. In the accuracy of the results I have no confidence. Observations of distance impracticable.

* On referring to our original manuscripts, this suggestion offered by Mr. Herschel is corroborated; for on the 19th June, 1822, the star was measured by one of us, in the absence of the other, and under very favourable circumstances, the mean of eight measures (the extremes of which differed only 1° 22&#x27;) gave, Position 45° 33&#x27; np. As however the observations subsequently made, were so much at variance with them, it was thought advisable to give the preference to our joint result, and to suppress the other.

The mean angular velocity corresponding to the whole interval is + 2°.964—say 3°. The great and almost sudden increase of angular velocity from 2° to nearly 7° per annum, is not verified; and the angle 40° o&#x27; nf for 1819, on which it rests, must of necessity have been considerably in error. Now this is the very angle which, according to the table (p. 252, Phil. Trans. 1824. III.) gives a deviation of 9° 2&#x27; from the computed place, so that the hypothesis there assumed respecting the orbit is considerably supported by the present observations. (H.)

The position of this star, as determined for the mean epoch 1820.97, is $60^\circ.29$, or $60^\circ\ 18&#x27;\ sp$ or $nf$ (Phil. Trans. 1824, III. p. 271.) It is now $61^\circ\ 2&#x27;$. The change in $4.55$ years is $-0^\circ\ 44&#x27;$, instead of $-2^\circ\ 36&#x27;$, which a computation founded on a mean motion of $-0^\circ.5792$ per annum would give. The determination for 1820 can however hardly be relied on for so great a degree of exactness as to bring out a precise quantity. The correspondence in direction is all we can expect, and is a satisfactory confirmation of the motion ascribed to this curious star. (H.)

In the former Paper the attention of astronomers was particularly directed to this star, on account of a considerable proper motion which it was supposed to have, in common with a very distant star 30 Scorpii; and as the point is a very interesting one, the preceding observations were made, with a view of placing the matter beyond doubt: a few comments upon them will perhaps be not without their use.

In the above diagram, the close stars of A B of 36 Ophiuchi are represented relatively to the star C, to 30 Scorpii, and to A B of 38 Ophiuchi, as seen in the telescope; C preceding A of 36 to the north, and A of 38 following it to the south.

First, as it regards Declination.

If any proper motion of 36 exist in this direction, (supposing the star C at rest) the effect of it will be to increase, or diminish

continued.

the difference of declination of AC; and should A of 38 be fixed, the difference of declination of A of 36, and A of 38, will also be increased or diminished. By this mode of observing we have two chances of detecting proper motion, each of which will afford a verification of the other; for suppose the star A of 36 Ophiuchi to have a motion toward the south, say at the rate of one second per annum, then will the difference of declination between it and the star C to the north of it, be increased annually by one second; but that which increased the difference of declination between these two stars, should diminish the difference of declination between A of 36, and A of 38 Ophiuchi; and if our observations be correct, the increase of difference on the one hand, should be exactly equal to the decrease of it, on the other; and vice versa, should the proper motion of A of 36, carry it toward the north.

Secondly, in Right Ascension.

Suppose the proper motion of A of 36 to be toward the west annually one second, the result will be, to lessen the difference of right ascension of it, and of the preceding star C, and at the same time to augment the difference of right ascension between A of 36, and A of 38; and, as before, the decrease in the one instance, should be equalled by the increase in the other; and if the proper motion of A of 36, take an easterly direction, it will be detected by consequences opposite to those just described, but offering similar verifications.

In the case of 61 Cygni, by following a similar mode of observing, (but using six stars of comparison instead of two,) I satisfied myself in a very few months, of the enormous proper motion of that extraordinary double star.

To those who may feel disposed thus to attack proper motion, I would hint, how indispensable it is, that their Equatorial should be well clamped, and that they should wait during the observations of difference of declination, till the earth’s diurnal motion bring each of the following stars, opposite that part of the wire where the bisection of the first star was made; the results will then be charged with no instrumental error, which it is in their power to avoid: the observations also should be conducted as nearly on the meridian as possible.

When the above was written, I was not aware that the star 38 Ophiuchi had been observed since the time of Flamsteed; on examining however Piazzi’s catalogue, I find that it stands there under the name of 31 Scorpii, and that its place has been determined by 19 observations of that eminent astronomer; perhaps therefore some light may at the present time, be thrown upon the subject under consideration; but some corrections will be needed by our observations, to render them comparable with those, to which we are alluding.

The star 36 Ophiuchi is composed of two stars of nearly equal magnitudes, and distant from each other $5&#x27;&#x27;.200$; whether Bradley’s instruments showed it double, does not appear; nor from Piazzi’s catalogue, does it seem that he saw it otherwise than as a single star; hence it is fair to
No. XXIV. R. A. $17^h\ 4^m$; Decl. $26^\circ\ 18&#x27;$ S.

36 Ophiuchi; H. and S. 243.

continued.

suppose, that the star was by one and the other observed as single; our observations therefore must be corrected by half the difference of declination, and by half the difference of right ascension, which with the preceding distance, and position $41^\circ\ 32&#x27;$ will be $1&#x27;&#x27;.724$ in declination, and $1&#x27;&#x27;.946$ on the parallel, equal to $0&#x27;&#x27;.147$ of right ascension in time.

For the star 38 Ophiuchi no correction of this sort will be required: its smaller star was certainly neither seen by Bradleynor by Piazzi; and its magnitude, even were it at the time closer than it now is, would not sensibly alter the apparent centre of the disc of A of 38.

But the differences of declination observed by us are uncorrected for refraction: the necessary equations being applied, we get,

Diff. of decl. of A of 36 Ophiuchi &amp; of 30 Scorpii $3&#x27;\ 2&#x27;&#x27;.403$

&amp; A of 38 Ophiuchi $5&#x27;\ 25&#x27;&#x27;.764$;

and when the corrections to reduce these results to observations of the centre of the two stars of 36 Ophiuchi are applied, the quantities become $3&#x27;\ 4&#x27;&#x27;.127$ and $5&#x27;\ 24&#x27;&#x27;.040$ for the differences of declination; and for differences of right ascension (in time) $52&#x27;&#x27;.591$ and $2&#x27;\ 11&#x27;&#x27;.905$ respectively.

Now by Bessel&#x27;s proper motion,* the difference of declination of 36 Ophiuchi and of 30 Scorpii, Epoch 1825.57, should be $3&#x27;\ 4&#x27;&#x27;.930$, differing with our determination only 8-tenths of a second: hence in declination, the two stars have either the same, or no proper motion.

But Bessel does not give the proper motion in right ascension, for it appears that Bradley† did not observe the

* Vide Fundam. Astronom. page 311.
† In Bradley&#x27;s published observations I have not met with any observed R. A. of 30 Scorpii, nor have I found any observation of 38 Ophiuchi, in the manuscript
transits of both stars; Piazzi however, by a comparison of his own observations with those of preceding astronomers, assigns to them quantities, which for 1825.57 would give difference of R. A. (in time) $52&#x27;&#x27;.50$, agreeing with our determination to 9-hundredths of a second; hence also in R. A. as well as in declination, they have, if any, the same proper motion.

If however the proper motions attributed to them be correct, and if none be enjoyed by A of 38 Ophiuchi, the difference of declination between 36 and 38 should be $5&#x27; 23&#x27;&#x27;.073$, differing not one second from our determination: and if the proper motion in right ascension attributed to 36 be correct (the star 38 being fixed), the difference of R. A. (in time) between them should be $2&#x27; 11&#x27;&#x27;.76$ only fourteen hundredths of a second, at variance with our observations; quantities which may be very fairly attributed to errors of observation.

Hence it follows, that the two stars 36 Ophiuchi and 30 Scorpii, although distant from each other more than 12 minutes, are journeying together through space; and that the annual proper motions ($1&#x27;&#x27;.0756$ and $1&#x27;&#x27;.1155$ toward the south, and $0&#x27;&#x27;.59$ and $0&#x27;&#x27;.58$ toward the west), assigned to them, are true.

From the above investigation we also learn, that the star 38 Ophiuchi has no sensible proper motion; consequently the observed increase of distance between it and the small star,* if it exist, must probably be sought for, in some peculiarity of the latter.

The change stated to have taken place in this star is confirmed by the present observations; according to which, compared with those of 1821, a motion of +1° 23&#x27; in angle, and —2&quot;.175 in distance, has taken place since our former measures. This is a remarkable verification of the relative motion both in position and distance; and as the change is contrary to what the presumed proper motion of the large star would alone produce, this star merits particular attention.

The last determination, considering the great number of measures it rests upon, may be regarded as entitled to great confidence, in spite of the discordant results of April 3 and May 3, 1825, which, however, whether rejected or retained, make little difference in the final mean. It was on these (unluckily), that the note at the end of the paper of 1824 was founded.

The fact of a great diminution of angular velocity then in

this star can hardly be doubted. But as it is inconsistent with the laws of central forces that this should take place without a corresponding increase of distance (for the angular velocity is inversely as the square of the distance in the apparent as well as in the real orbit, whatever be its position with regard to the line of sight), it becomes necessary to examine more minutely into the distances at the different epochs. It will be observed, however, that in all the interval from 1781 to 1819 we find no measure of the distance, and that the maximum of angular velocity must have taken place somewhere in this interval. (See Phil. Trans. 1824. iii. p. 290-291.) In such a case we must recur to estimations in diameters, though necessarily less to be depended on than positive measures. On re-examining Sir W. Herschel&#x27;s MSS., we fortunately find the following observations, which throw considerable light on this point, and in some measure supply the deficiency of measures. It will be recollected that his measures of distance are always supposed to include both diameters of the stars measured.

&quot;October 27, 1779. $3&#x27;&#x27;.593$. They are very difficult to measure, and for that reason I join also an exact estimation by the eye. The vacancy between them is $2\frac{1}{2}$ diameters of the largest—certainly more than two and less than 3. The smallest may be about $\frac{2}{3}$ or $\frac{3}{5}$ of the diameter of the other. They are exactly in the equatorial motion; the largest goes first. The situation I took by letting them run along the hair.&quot;

&quot;May 11, 1780. $5&#x27;&#x27;.468$; but very difficult to take, and
&quot;therefore not much to be depended on.&quot; . . . &quot;I am
&quot;apt to believe that this method generally gives the
&quot;distance too large.&quot;

&quot;June 19, 1780. $1\frac{2}{3}$ diameter, or between $1\frac{1}{2}$ and $1\frac{3}{4}$ by
&quot;very exact estimation. . . . . By measures $4&#x27;&#x27;.375$.&quot;

&quot;August 28, 1780. $4&#x27;&#x27;.531$. Almost 2 diameters of the
&quot;largest, which is the preceding star. The difference
&quot;in size almost 2 to 1, or $1\frac{3}{4}$ to 1.&quot;

&quot;May 27, 1781. Much above 2 diameters of the largest
&quot;with 460.&quot;

&quot;April 28, 1783. Above 2 diameters.&quot;

From all these observations, it is clear that the interval
between the stars about the year 1780 could not be less
than 2 diameters, and by a mean of all the estimations, must
have been about this quantity, or rather more than less. The
small star being taken at 0.6 of the diameter of the large,
the distance of their centres must have been $2.8 D$, and the
distance, including the diameters, $3.6 D$. Now as this distance
by the mean of all the measures, was $4&#x27;&#x27;.492$, we have $D = 1&#x27;&#x27;.25$ and $2.8 D = 3&#x27;&#x27;.500$.

Again; we find the following observation, the only one
which occurs in the interval in question.

&quot;June 3, 1804. About $1\frac{1}{4}$ diameter of L.&quot;

This would give for the distance between the centers
$2.05 D = 2&#x27;&#x27;.5625$.

observations establish the point in question, viz. that a very considerable diminution of distance really accompanied the great increase of angular velocity, and that as the velocity has since diminished, the distance has actually undergone a corresponding augmentation. It is much to be regretted that the opportunity of observing this interesting object in perihelio has been lost. (H.)

I think it is very evident the erroneous result will be that given in the published memoir; supposing the wrong 10th degree to have been taken, the mean angle as read off, instead of being $-44^\circ\ 33&#x27;$ would be $-54^\circ\ 33&#x27; = +35^\circ\ 27&#x27;$, a difference from the angle here determined easily enough to be admitted, when the closeness of the stars is considered.

These observations make it clear that a mistake of $10^\circ$ (as supposed by Mr. South above) must have been committed in the reading off of the micrometer in 1823. This star must therefore be struck out of the list of Binary stars, as the present measures compared with that of 1783 present only a difference of $0^\circ\ 57&#x27;$. This will serve among other instances to show how necessary it is to repeat the measures of double stars on several nights. (H.)

Mean Result.

Position 40° 40&#x27; sf (32 Obs.); Distance 1&#x27;&#x27;.405 (20 Obs.);
Epoch 1826.18.

Our former observations gave 37° 8&#x27; sf for the position of this double star, Epoch 1823.13; offering a difference of more than 3½ degrees with the present determination; but the observations are attended with so much difficulty, that no positive conclusion can be formed relative to the rest or motion of this star: the first memoir contained no observations of distance.
whilst the former part of the communication was in the press.

No. VII. R. A. $9^h\ 19^m$; Decl. $9^\circ\ 50&#x27;$ N.

ω³ Leonis; I. 26; S. 600.

Double; 6th and 9th magnitudes; small, pale blue.

Sloane-street; February 12, 1826; Seven-feet Equatorial.

Position = $64^\circ\ 14&#x27;\ s.f.\ | \ 6\ Obs.\ | \ Diff.\ =\ 4^\circ\ 42&#x27;$. Excessively difficult.

The small star only visible by glimpses; observations made on the meridian, with 787; the extreme unsteadiness of the stars renders it impossible to procure any measures of distance, and those of position must be received with caution.

The unfavourableness of the weather has not allowed me to procure other measures of this difficult star. Sloane-street, March 18, 1826.

The position April 4, 1783, was measured with a 20-feet reflector, 12 inches aperture, and found to be $20^\circ\ 54&#x27;\ s.f.$ The change is very great, no less than $43^\circ\ 20&#x27;$ in 42.8 years, or almost precisely a degree per annum. There can be little doubt, therefore, that this very curious double star is entitled to a place among the revolving stars or Binary systems. The uncertainty of the present observations, arising from the difficulty of the star, and the unfavourable weather, might render us cautious in admitting this conclusion; but a series of well-agreeing measures by Mr. Struve, on four nights, from Feb. 25, to April 4, 1825, which give a mean result $63^\circ.7\ s.f.$ sufficiently establish the fact. These interesting observations are contained in a letter from Mr. Struve, dated April 21, 1825. (H.)
