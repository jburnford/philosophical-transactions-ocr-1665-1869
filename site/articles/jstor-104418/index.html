No. 461. p. 473. l. 4. from the Bottom, for Minutes read Seconds.

An Addition to the Reverend Dr. Miles&#x27;s Account of Fern-Seed, ibid. p. 772. after l. 16.

Whereas I have mention&#x27;d, that a sort of Fungus, of a light-brown Colour, grows over the Seed-vessels of the Filix mas; this is to be understood to have that Appearance, when the Seeds are full-ripe, and the Vessels containing them are prepared to burst: For I have since view&#x27;d them, soon after they begin to appear, and also when the Seed-vessels are nearly grown to their full Size; at which times the said Fungus is a fine Membrane of a bright Green, entirely covering the Tuft of Seed-vessels like a Cap, and closely adhering to the Surface of the Leaf of the Plant: But when the Seed-vessels are arriv&#x27;d, at Perfection in Size, and able to bear being expos&#x27;d, it begins to recede from the Leaf, and to hang over them in form of an Umbrella; and as they grow ripe, it gradually changes brown, and curls up a little, making the Appearance first-mention&#x27;d.

Tooting, January 24. 1744-5.

Henry Miles.

ERRATUM.
