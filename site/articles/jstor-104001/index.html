<div class="ocr-text">VII. Some Observations of Eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s Satellites, made by Geo. Lynn, Esq; at Southwick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire; Communicated in a Letter to James Jurin, M.D. F.R.S. and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London.

SIR,

HEARING that some Foreigners enquired for Observations of the Eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s Satellite, I have sent what I had of that Sort: They are indeed but few these two last Years, on account of my Absence during part of the Time for Observation, and also on account of the small Arc Jupiter has lately made above our Horizon. The Telescope I made use of is the same as formerly, having a thirteen Foot Object-Glass, with an Aperture of two Inches and four Tenths, and an Eye-Glass of two Inches and an half Focus. By apparent Time, at Southwick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire, Longitude West from London, 00 Deg. 30 Min. as follows:

Month. D. h. &#x27; &quot;
1730. The 2d Satellite began to emerge April 29 10 19 20
It seemed in a Minute after to be as bright as the 4th Satellite — 20 20
And at full Brightness about — 21 20
Month. D. h. 1 11

1730. The 4th Satellite emerged Jan. 25 9 45 nearly
1730. The 2d began to immerge Nov. 28 13 17 46
And was quite out of Sight at 19 46
1731. The 2d began to emerge March 29 11 33 8
And seem&#x27;d at full Brightness about 36 30
The 1st Satellite began April 18 11 45 10
to emerge —
And was at full Brightness about 46 10
Again the 1st began to emerge May 4 10 4 30
Was at full Brightness about — 5 45
And passed by the 3d Satellite at 11 49 30
1731. The 1st Satellite began to Jan. 7 12 2 55
immerge —
And was quite out of Sight about 4 25
1732. The 3d Satellite began to Jan. 28 14 16 00
immerge —
Was but equal in Light to the 2d at 19 00
Quite gone at — 24 00
1732. The 2d Satellite began April 30 12 23 57
to emerge —
The 1st Satellite began May 6 12 48 44
to emerge —
1733. The 3d Satellite quite Febr. 18 13 5 30
disappeared —
1733. Again the 3d Satellite April 2 13 3 30
disappear&#x27;d —
But it began to fail of its Light
about 5 or 6 Minutes before.
1735. The 2d Satellite immerged May 28 10 45 00
The 3d began to emerge August 3 9 10 30
And was 4 or 5 Minutes before it came to its full
Brightness.
