It having been found by Experience that several Curious Persons have been and are desirous to receive some Account of what the Learned part of the World are for the present busied about.
in the examination of experimental and real Knowledge, and what Discoveries they have made in any part thereof. The Royal Society have therefore thought fit to order, that Care be taken for the future, that such Accounts shall be published in these Transactions Monthly, as may answer their expectations: Wherein will be contained not only several Experiments, Invented and tried by divers of their own Body, but also such other useful Discourses or Relations concerning Physical, Mathematical, and Mechanical Theories or Observations as shall be communicated by their Correspondants for that Intent, or shall otherwise be sent to, or collected by the Person that hath engaged himself in this Undertaking. He doth therefore hereby Advertise all such Curious Persons as shall be desirous to promote this Design, by Contributing what shall occur to them that may be useful thereto; that upon their Communications they shall have such Acknowledgments made them as shall be to their satisfaction.

And whereas divers Books and Treatises of such Philosophical Matters as fall under the Societies Consideration, are published in Foreign Parts, which are seldom to be found till some years after, if at all, to the great damage both of the Authors and the Printers of them, and more especially to the Inquisitive of this Nation: It is therefore desired and hoped that for the future, all such Authors or Publishers, or such Ingenious Gentlemen as shall in their Travels meet with such Books or Tracts, will be pleased to send or lend them to the Undertaker of this Affair, that so an Impartial Account and Extract of them may be communicated to the Curious.

And tho&#x27; upon an extraordinary occasion these Transactions have for some Months last past been omitted, yet that defect will be soon supplied by the speedy Publication of what has occurred since December last, and will be for the future continued at least as punctually as heretofore.

Those that desire to Contribute to the carrying on of this Work, may please to send the Accounts they would have Printed to Mr. H. Hunt at Gresham College, London, for the Secretaries of the Royal Society.</div>
