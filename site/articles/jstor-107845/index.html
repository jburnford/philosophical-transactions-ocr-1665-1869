OBSERVANDA.

Height of the Cistern of the Barometer above a Fixed Mark on Waterloo Bridge = 83 feet 2½ in.

Above the mean level of the Sea (presumed about) = 95 feet.

The External Thermometer is 2 feet higher than the Barometer Cistern.

Height of the Receiver of the Rain Gauge above the Court of Somerset House = 79 feet 0 in.

The hours of observation are of Mean Time, the day beginning at Midnight.

The Thermometers are graduated by Fahrenheit&#x27;s Scale.

The Barometer is divided into inches and decimals.</div>
