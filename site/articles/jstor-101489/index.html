the other; and more in fresh ones, than in the stale.

12. That having somewhat scaled the Convex-side of the
shell, and discover&#x27;d the Communication of the holes, where-
in the often-mention&#x27;d viscous moisture, that has any form of
insects, is found; he smelt a scent, that was like the water of a
squeezed Oyster.

13. That the Worms give no light, when irritated, but if
they do, the light lasts but a very little time, whereas that which
appears in those, that were not angered before, continues a
great while; the Observer affirming to have kept of it above
2 hours.

So far the Journal des Scavans; which intimates withal, that
if the Observers had had better Microscopes, they could have bet-
ter examin&#x27;d this matter.

But since the curious here in England are so well furnish
with good ones, &#x27;tis hoped, that they will employ some of
them for further and more minute Observations of these
Worms; it being a matter, which, joined with other Obser-
vations, already made by some excellent persons here, (espe-
cially Mr. Boyle) upon this subject of Light, may prove very
luciferous to the doctrine of it, so much yet in the dark.

Some Observations
Of the Effects of Touch and Friction.

The Operations and Effects of Touch and Friction having
been lately much taken notice off, and being lookt upon by
some, as a great Medical Branch, for the curing of many di-
seases and infirmities; it will perhaps not be unseasonable to
mention (here also) some Observations relating thereunto;
which may give an occasion to others, to consider this subject
more, than has been done heretofore, and to make fur-
ther
ther Observations and Tryals concerning the power of the same.

And First, the Illustrious Lord of Verulam, in his History of Life and Death, Histor. 6. §. 3. observes, That Motion and Warmth (of which two, Frition consists) draws forth into the parts, New Juice and Vigour. And Canon. XIII. he affirms, That Fritions conduce much to Longevity. See the same, Connex. ix. §. 26. &amp;c.

Secondly, The Honourable Robert Boyle, in his Usefulness of Experimental Philosophy, sect. 2. ch. 15. considering the Body of a Living man or any Animal, as an Engine, so composed, that there is a conspiring communication betwixt its parts, by virtue whereof a very slight impression of adventitious matter upon some one part, may be able to work, on some other distant part, or perhaps on the whole Engine, a change far exceeding, what the same adventitious matter could do upon a Body not so contrived: Representing, I say, an Animal in this manner, and thence inferring, how it may be alter&#x27;d for the better or worse by motions or impulses, confessedly Mechanicall, observes; How some are recover&#x27;d from swooning fits by pricking; others grow faint and do vomit by the bare motion of a Coach; others fall into a troublesome sickness by the agitation of a Ship, and by the Sea-air (whence they recover by rest, and by going a shore.) Again, how in our Stables a Horse well-curried is half-fed: How some can tell by the Milk of their Asses, whether that day they have been well curried or not: Arguing hence, that if in Milk the alteration is so considerable, it should be so likewise in the Blood, or other Juices, of which the Blood is elaborated, and consequently in divers of the principal parts of the Body. Where also (upon the authority of Piso) he refers the Reader to the Brasilian Empiricks, whose
wild Frictions, as unskilfully as they order them, do strange things, both in preserving health, and curing diseases; curing Cold and Chronical ones by Friction, as they do Acute ones, by Unction.

Thirdly, The learned Dr. John Beale, did not long since communicate by some Letters; First, that he could make good proof of the curing or killing a very great and dangerous Wen (that had been very troublesome for two or three years,) by the application of a dead man&#x27;s hand, whence the Patient felt such a cold stream pass to the Heart, that it did almost cause in him a fit of swooning. Secondly, that, upon his brothers knowledge, a certain Cook in a Noble Family of England (wherein that brother of his then lived) having been reproached for the ugliness of his Warty hands, and return&#x27;d for answer, that he had tried many remedies, but found none, was bid by his Lord, to rub his hand with that of a dead man; and that this Lord dying soon after, the Cook made use both of his Lords advice and hand, and speedily found good effect. (Which is also confirm&#x27;d by what Mr. Boyle relates in his lately mentioned Book, of Dr. Harvey&#x27;s frequently succesfull triall, of curing some Tumors or Excrencencies, by holding on them such a Hand.) Here is Friction or Touch, to mortifie Wens, to drive away swellings and Excrencencies: And why not to repell or dissipate Spirits, that may have a dangerous influence upon the Brain, or other parts; as well as to call forth the retired ones into the habit of the Body, for Invigoration? Thirdly, that a Gentleman, who came lately out of Ireland, lay at his House, and inform&#x27;d him of an aged Knight there, who having great pain in his feet, insomuch that he was unable to use them, suffered; as he was going to bed, a loving Spaniel to lick his feet; which was, for the present very pleasing to him, so that he used it mornings and evenings, till he found the pain appeased, and the use of his feet restored. This, faith
the Relator, was a gentle touch, and transpiration; for he found the Spirits transpire with a pleasing Kind of Titillation. Fourthly, that he can assure of an honest Blacksmith, who by his healing hand converted his Bars of Iron into Plates of Silver; and had this particular faculty, that he caused Vomitings by stroaking the Stomack; gave the Stool by stroaking the Belly; appeased the Gout, and other pains, by stroaking the parts affected.

Some particulars, communicated from foreign parts, concerning the Permanent Spott in Jupiter; and a Contest between two Artists about Optick Glasses, &amp;c.

Eustachio de Divinis (saith the Informer,) has written a large Letter, wherein he pretends, that the Permanent Spot in Jupiter hath been first of all discovered with his Glasses; and that the P. Gotignies is the first that hath thence deduced the Motion of Jupiter about his Axis; and that Signior Cassini opposed it at first; to whom the said Gotignies wrote a letter of complaint thereupon.

The same Eustachio pretends likewise, that his great Glasses excell those of Campani; and that in all the tryals, made with them, they have performed better; and that Campani was not willing to do, what was necessary for well comparing the one with the other. viz. To put equall Eyeglasses in them, or to exchange the same Glasses.

The said Divini affirms also, that he hath found a way to know</div>
