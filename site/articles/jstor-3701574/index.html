An extraordinary and surprising agitation of the waters, though without any perceptible motion of the earth, having been observed in various parts of this island, both maritime and inland, on the same day, and chiefly about the time that the more violent commotions of both earth and waters so very extensively affected many very distant parts of the globe, the following accounts relating to the former have been transmitted to the Society; in which are specified the times and places when and where they happened.
