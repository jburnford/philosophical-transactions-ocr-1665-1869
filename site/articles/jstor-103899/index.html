<div class="ocr-text">V. Observations of the Occultation of Mars by the Moon, Oct. 7. 1736. communicated to the Royal Society.

1. An Observation of the Occultation of Mars by the Moon, Oct. 7. 1736. made by Mr. Geo. Graham, F.R.S. in Fleetstreet, London, with a Refracting Telescope of 12 Feet.

October 7th, the first Contact could not be seen for Clouds.

Apparent Time.
H. M. S.
At 14 24 44 Mars appear&#x27;d about half cover&#x27;d, but a distinct View could not be had for flying Clouds.
14 25 21 Mars totally cover&#x27;d, the last Ray of Light being then lost.
15 11 22 The Moon appear&#x27;d, but Mars was not seen, no Part being yet emerg&#x27;d.
15 15 11 I judg&#x27;d it was quite emerg&#x27;d, but Clouds prevented the Moon&#x27;s Limb from being distinctly seen.

2. An Observation of an Occultation of Mars by the Moon, in Covent-Garden, 1736. by J. Bevis, M.D.

Before the Eclipse, I took several Differences of Right Ascension and Declination between $\alpha$ and $\mu$ Piscium, for ascertaining the true Place of Mars: As also several Differences of Right Ascension and Declination between the Moon and Mars, before and after the Eclipse, which I shall give another Time:

Octob. 7. P. M.
Apparent Time.
H. M. S.
14 24 10 I was surpriz&#x27;d to see Mars continue quite round, though hardly, to Appearance, disjoin&#x27;d from the scabrous Edge of the Moon; but that Instant I thought it began to lose its Figure.
—Clouds.
14 25 26 The Moon shone out bright again, but Mars was intirely vanish&#x27;d.
15 14 46 The Moon being just clear of a Cloud, I saw Mars partly emerged.
15 14 49 He seem&#x27;d just half out; then Clouds came on again, so that I saw not the final Contact.

The Moon&#x27;s Diameter was 21,157 Parts of the Micrometer and its illuminated Part pass&#x27;d over the horary Thread in 2 Minutes, 3 Seconds.
I am certain of the Time to 2 or 3 Seconds.
