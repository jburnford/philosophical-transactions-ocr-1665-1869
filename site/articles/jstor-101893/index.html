In the left Ventricle was another Polypus not so large as the former: It had two Branches, one in the Pulmonary Vein, another in the Arteria Magna, or Aorta.

One of the Vesiculae being opened had a large cluster of small Ova as big as Grapes, all replete with Liquor: All the rest contained nothing but Serum.

A Relation of an extraordinary effect of the power of Imagination: Communicated by Mr. Edward Smith, Secretary to the Philosophical Society at Dublin, as it was brought before that Company, by Mr. St. George Ash. R. Soc. S. who had seen the thing.

ONE Elizabeth Dooly of the County of Kilkenny was aged 13 Years in January last: Her Mother being with Child of her was frighted by a Cow as she milked it, thrown down and hit on her Temple, within an eighth of an Inch of her Eye, by the Cow&#x27;s Teat. This Child has exactly in that place, a piece of Flesh resembling a Cow&#x27;s Teat, about 3 Inches and half in length: &#x27;Tis very red, has a Bone in the midst about half the length of it; &#x27;tis perforated and she Weeps through it; when she Laughs it wrinles up and contracts to two thirds of its length, and it grows in proportion to the rest of her Body. She is as sensible there as in any other part. This is lookt upon to be as strange an instance of the strength of Imagination as can be produced.
