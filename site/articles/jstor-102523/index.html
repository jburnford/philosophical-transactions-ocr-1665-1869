<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">IV. Of the Posture-Master.

In the Pall Mall at London, lived one Clark (call&#x27;d, The Posture-Master) that had such an absolute Command of all his Muscles and Joints, that he can dis-joint almost his whole Body; so that he impos&#x27;d on our famous Mul-lems, who lookt on him in so miserable a Condition, that he would not undertake his Cure: Tho&#x27; he was a well grown Fellow, yet he would appear in all the Deformities that can be imagin&#x27;d, as Hunch Back&#x27;d, Pot Belly&#x27;d, Sharp Breast&#x27;d; he dis-jointed his Arms, Shoulders, Legs and Thighs, that he will appear&#x27;d as great an Object of Pity as any; and he has often impos&#x27;d on the same Company, where he has been just before, to give him Money as a Cripple; he looking so much unlike himself, that they could not know him. I have seen him make his Hips stand out a considerable way from his Loins, and so high that they seem&#x27;d to invade the Place of his Back, in which Posture he has so large a Belly, as tho&#x27; one of our Company had one of a considerable Size, yet it seem&#x27;d lank compar&#x27;d with his: He turns his Face into all Shapes, so that by himself he acts all the uncouth, demure, odd Faces of a Quaker&#x27;s Meeting: I could not have conceiv&#x27;d it possible to have done what he did, unless I had seen it; and I am sensible how short I am come to a full Description of him: None certainly can describe what he does, but himself. He began Young to bring his Body to it, and there are several Instances of Persons that can move several of their Bones out of their Joints, using themselves to it from Children.</div>
