<div class="ocr-text">XI. A Description of the several Strata of Earth, Stone, Coal, &amp;c. found in a Coal-Pit at the West End of Dudley in Staffordshire: By Mr. Fettiplace Bellers, F. R. S. To which is added, a Table of the Specifick Gravity of each Stratum: By Mr Fr. Hauksbee, F. R. S. Communicated by Dr. Hans Sloane, R. S. Secr.

I. A Yellowish Clay, which lies immediately under the Turf.

II. A Blewish Clay.

III. A Blewish hard Clay; the Miners call it Clunch. This is one of the certain Signs of Coal. It has in it Mineral Plants.

IV. A Blewish soft Clay.

V. A fine-grained Gray Stone: It lies next the former, and is found in some Pits only.

VI. A Clay almost like the First, only whiter.

VII. A hard Gray Rock; with something like the Impressions of Vegetables, but none distinct.

VIII. A Blew Clunch, like Numb. 3. with Mineral Plants in it.

VIII. +. This Stratum (which is the same with Numb. 13.) was not taken.

IX. Coal, called Bench-Coal.

X. Coal, less black and shining than the former, called Slipper-Coal.

XI. Coal, more black and shining, called Spin-Coal.

XII. A Coal like Cannal-Coal, by the Miners called Stone Coal. These Strata of Coal have between each
of them a Bat, of about the thickness of a Crown Piece.

XIII. A black Substance, called the Dun-Row-Bat.

XIV. A hard grey Iron Oar, called the Dun-Row Iron-Stone.

XV. A blewish Bat, in which the following Iron-Stone lyes, called the White-Row.

XVI. A hard blackish Iron Oar, lying in small Nodules, having between them a white Substance; and from thence by the Miners called the White-Row-Grains, or Iron Stone.

XVII. A hard grey Iron Oar, with some white spots in it, called the Mid-row Grains.

XVIII. A black fissile Substance, called the Gublin-Bat.

XIX. A hard blackish Iron Oar, with white spots in it, called the Gublin Iron-Stone.

XX. A Bat, in Substance much like that of Numb. XVIII.

XXI. A hard grey Iron Oar, called the Cannoc, or Cannot-Iron-Stone.

XXII. A Bat, somewhat harder than Numb. XX.

XXIII. A dark, gray, hard Iron Oar, called the Rubble Iron-Stone.

XXIV. The Table-Bat, next under the Rubble Iron-Stone.

XXV. A coarse sort of Coal, called the Foot-Coal.

XXVI. A black, brittle, shining Bat.

XXVII. The Heathen-Coal.

XXVIII. A Substance like a coarse Coal, but by the Miners called a Bat; perhaps because it does not burn well.

XXIX. The Bench-Coal.

XXX.
XXX. A Bat under the last, and is as low (viz. 188½ Feet) as they generally dig, tho&#x27; there is a coarse Coal under this.

N.B. Those Substances, which divide the Strata of Coals and Iron Oars from each other, are called Bats by the Miners: They are generally black, consisting of a Matter peculiar to themselves, and are of a Texture nearest like Marle; tho&#x27; some of them are fissile, and others have a Substance not unlike Coal mixt with them.

A Table of the Thickness of each Stratum, and its Proportion to Water, or Specifick Gravity.

By which it is evident, that the Gravities of the several Strata are in no manner of Order; but purely casual, as if mixt by chance.</div>
