*The Rain Gauge is, in every state of the weather, invariably examined every morning at 9 o&#x27;clock, and the result set down in the appropriate column; while, on the other hand, any sensible exhibition of rain is equally noticed under the Remarks on the Weather in the last column, independently of any reference to the indications of the Gauge. During the present month, the amount of rain appears to have been too small to become appreciable in the Rain Gauge employed.—J.H.*
