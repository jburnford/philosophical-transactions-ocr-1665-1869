AN INDEX TO THE SIXTY-NINTH VOLUME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS.

A.

Acid. More of the vitriolic in gypsum, than in selenitical spars, p. 17.

Ether, how to produce inflammable air with the vitriolic, p. 384. Air from it does not evaporate as the ether itself, p. 388. Its explosive force increased by camphire, p. 389. Great explosive force of very pure dephlogisticated air, and ether, p. 407. Reason why a drop of it communicates to dephlogisticated air a much stronger explosive force than common inflammable air from metals, p. 414.

Air. Difference between Dr. Priestley and Mr. Sheele about the noxious effects of the inflammable, p. 336. Animals killed by breathing it, when the receivers that contained it were immersed in quicksilver, p. 338. Has the same effects when passed through water, as when shaken in water for a minute&#x27;s time, p. 339. But may be breathed when shaken in it for a long time, p. 340. Kills quadrupeds not so readily as birds, ibid. Mr. Sheele&#x27;s breathing it may possibly be accounted for, by its being breathed through the lungs, and not the nose, ibid. Experiment proves the contrary, p. 341. Experiment to prove that inflammable air does not act upon the body of the animal, p. 342. Explanation of Abbé Fontana&#x27;s formula to express the diminution of respirable air, p. 343. Experiment to shew inflammable air worse than common, p. 344, &amp;c. Inflammable, better after being breathed than before, p. 348. Air from the lungs alters the nature of inflammable air, p. 349. Animals affected by inflammable air, more or less, according to their size, compared with the quantity of air, p. 351. Inflammable air still inflammable after being breathed, contrary
trary to Mr. Sheeles assertion, p. 351. The light sensation on breathing inflammable air owing to its specific levity, p. 352. Air lightened by fire breathed more easily than more condensed air, p. 353. Why inflammable air can be breathed when mixed with common air, p. 355. Inflammable lighter than common air, and does not mix with it, p. 357. Account of the sparks which dart from the inflammable air of metals applied to a candle, p. 359. And which are the distinctive quality of inflammable air extracted from metals, ibid. Phlogistic principle more combined with this air than with the others, p. 360. Analysis of the decomposition of the inflammable air of metals, p. 361. Great expectations from the use of the dephlogisticated air as a remedy, p. 377. Large quantities of it extracted from water which has stood some time exposed to the sun, ibid. Reason why gunpowder does not want a free access of common air to be consumed by fire, p. 404. Uses which may be derived from the ability to produce any quantity of dephlogisticated at pleasure, p. 416. The usual state of it in the Hartz mines a mean among the different states of the exterior air as found by Mr. de Luc&#x27;s observations, p. 495. Many modifications of it besides its weight and heat to be considered, p. 496. Difference of the effects of heat on it one great cause of the diversity of results in experiments, p. 498. Necessity of multiplying meteorological instruments to determine its influences, p. 501. Experiments on air extracted from the water of a well, p. 432. That extracted from the water of the river Seine, shewn to be better than atmospheric air, p. 434. Extracted from the water d&#x27;Arqueil, experiments on it, p. 436. Is shewn to be better than the air extracted from Seine water, p. 436, 437. That of distilled water extracted, and shewn to be better than that of the water d&#x27;Arqueil, p. 437. New characteristic by which dephlogisticated air may be distinguished from common, p. 439. A greater quantity of those airs which contain the least phlogiston absorbed by water, ibid. Impossible to determine the quality of it when extracted from vessels filled with water by means of fire, ibid. Result of experiments on water deprived of air, p. 440. Water diminishes the noxious part of tainted, and dephlogisticates common, ibid. How to prevent it being altered by the vapour of the water, in the above experiments, p. 442. Common air shaken in water is increased in bulk, ibid. Dephlogisticated is decreased, p. 444. Which shews that this last differs essentially from common air, ibid. Great nicety required in these experiments, p. 445. Experiments made to ascertain the salubrity of the atmospherical in various places, countries, and situations, not to be depended upon, p. 446. Difference of the air between one country, or any particular situation, and another, not so great as is commonly imagined, p. 447. Air taken from different parts of Paris and London examined, and found not to differ materially, p. 447, 448. Differences between the changes of air at the same place at different times, much greater than the difference of air of different places.

And of one by Mr. Antoni, p. 393. What the difference between the quantity of elastic fluid obtained by Robins, and others, may have been owing to, p. 393. Bernoulli&#x27;s calculation of it probably nearest the truth, but proves the justness of that of the others, p. 394, 395. Nature of gunpowder explained in a different way from what it has hitherto been, p. 395—397. Nitre and charcoal sufficient of themselves to make very good, p. 397.

Difference of the inflammation of gunpowder, and of dephlogisticated and inflammable air in the air-pistol, what owing to, ibid. Probable that the dephlogisticated and inflammable air, extricated in the firing of it, undergoes a diminution by its inflammation, p. 401. Agreement of this supposition with the analysis of gunpowder, as made by Abbé Fontana, p. 402. Accurate calculation of the expansion of, a very difficult undertaking, p. 403. Reason why it does not want a free access of common air to be consumed by fire, p. 404. Why a single spark of fire propagates the combustion throughout it with great rapidity, p. 405.

Circumstance in the production of hermaphrodites in cattle, which seems to be an established principle in the economy of propagation of that species of animal, and not a production of chance, p. 284.

Iron, and its solutions, contribute to hasten and promote the progress of the concretion and induration of stone, whenever they meet with cementing crystalline particles, which abound in sea-water, p. 38. Any induration, or petrefaction of matter, much hastened, and the consolidation rendered much more compleat by being near a mass of iron, still more by the admixture of any solution of that metal, p. 39. Confirmation of this doctrine by three instances, p. 40, 41, 43, 45. Dr. Fothergill&#x27;s conjectures on this subject, p. 47.
