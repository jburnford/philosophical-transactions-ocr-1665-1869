What should be the Cause of this wonderful Phenomenon, I am not able to conjecture, being certain the Compasses, as to their mechanical Structure, were very perfect, and answer&#x27;d very well both before and after, during the whole Voyage; there is never any Oil used to make them move easily, for in that Case it might often congeal, and stop the Motion of the Chard: But whether the Cold of the Climate hath a Power to deprive the Needle of its Virtue for a Time, or that the Friction is increas&#x27;d thereby to such a Degree, as it cannot be overcome by the Magnetism, I am not able to say; but the Fact is certain and surprizing.

IV. Extract of a Letter from Dr. Andrew Cantwell of Montpelier, to Dr. Thomas Stack, dated June 23. 1732. concerning an uncommon Palsey of the Eye-lids.

JUNE 7. 1732. Mons. Guilliminet, Counsellor of the Court of Aides, went hence to Balleruc, (whither I had been call&#x27;d to attend a Patient) with a Nun his Daughter, about 30 Years of Age. This Lady was troubled with as singular a Disease as I have heard of. &#x27;Twas an intermitting periodical Palsey of
the Eye-lids, which began every Evening about six o’Clock, with a Defluxion from the great Canthus, of a whitish Matter of some Consistence; so that she remain’d blind till next Morning, and then recover’d the Use of her Eye-lids, as before. This Disorder held her since February last; from which Time all Remedies order’d her by her Physician proving ineffectual, she was sent to Balleruc for the Benefit of the Waters. As we lodged in the same House, I had a fair Opportunity of observing the Effects the Waters had on her. She was pump’d on the back Part of her Head and Neck Seven times, without receiving any sensible Benefit: The Ninth time her Disorder seiz’d her an Hour later than usual, and the Defluxion was less and thinner. The next Evening it retarded two Hours, and the following Night she had as much Command of her Eye-lids as ever. She took the Douche (for so we call that way of pumping) the next Morning and Evening, and was entirely cured. I sat with her an Hour that Evening, carefully observ’d her Eye-lids by Candle-light, and ask’d her several Questions on her Disorder. She open’d her Eyes as well as I did mine, and set out the next Day for Montpelier.</div>
