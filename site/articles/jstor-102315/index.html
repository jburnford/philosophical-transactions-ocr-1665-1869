<div class="ocr-text">III. An Account of a Stone of the Bladder, which weighed 51 Ounces, or Three Pounds Three Ounces, and a Stone out of the Bladder successfully, which adhered to it. By Dr. Charles Preston.

In the Hospital at Paris called, L&#x27;Hopital de La Charité, there is preserved, amongst the great number of Stones, Extracted from the Bladder, by the Operation of Lithotomy, one of a prodigious bigness, weighing about Fifty one Ounces, which makes Three Pounds and Three Ounces; it was taken from one of the Religious Brothers, in the House who attends the Sick, in the Month of June 1690. but he Dyed in the Operation; for the Stone being so big, it could not be Extracted till after his Death, it is kept as a great Curiosity, with an Inscription upon it in French, as follows:

Pierre pesant 51 onces qui font 3 Livres 3 onces.
Qui a été tiré dans cet hopital : au Mois
De juin, 1690. et que l&#x27;on conserve dans le convent.

In the Month of June, 1696. while I was at Ghent attending his Majesty&#x27;s Hospital, there happened a very singular Case in the Operation of Lithotomy, viz. a Stone adherent to the bottom of the Bladder; this was found by one Monsieur Parfait Lithotomist of the Place, who when he made the Operation could not Extract the Stone, but was obliged to leave his Patient in that Case, there followed an Imposthume, so that eight Days after, he Extracted it with great ease. The next Day he shewed me the Stone (as also to most of the Chyrur-
Chirurgions in the Hospitals) to which the Fibres by which it was tyed were yet adherent, and could easily be observed by the naked Eye, without the help of a Microscope, so that I could not question any thing as to the matter of Fact. All those that I had occasion to converse with of Lithotomy, while at Paris, deny the Stone is adherent to the bottom of the Bladder, and that they never observed the same; and I do not remember of any Author that writes of it, so that it seems to be a Case altogether new.

IV. Part of a Letter to Dr. George Garden, giving an Account of the Effects of a very extraordinary Thunder near Aberdeen in Scotland.

SIR,

When I wrote to you last, I would have given you an Account of the sad Accident that fell out in this place, but I referred it to your Brother the Professor: However, since you are now desirous to have an Account of it, you may take the truest I can give you as followeth:

On the 24th of July last, we had an extraordinary pleasant Forenoon, with continual Sun-shine, till about half an Hour after Three in the Afternoon we had some Rain, after which happened two Claps of Thunder, tho&#x27; not very great, and then a great Shower of Hail, in which time happened a third Clap which made all our Loss. We were Sixteen in Number, none of us hapning to be out or absent at the time; for my Custom was to have examined their Tasks in the Forenoon, and I used to give them somewhat else in the</div>
