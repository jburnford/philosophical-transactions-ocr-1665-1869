Note

What in N°. 54. p. 1077. in the Answ. to Qu. 1. is said
of the Observation of Briners, is to be understood, that
the Workmen think so, that they make more Salt with the
same quantity of brine, at the Ful Moon, then at other times,
though really they do not, as the Answerer Judgeth by his Ob-
serv. in N°. 53. p. 1064: Who hath since advertis&#x27;d, that &#x27;tis
possible at times, when the Pit hath been much drawn first, that
then, if without intermission they go on malling till the Full,
they may make at that time more Salt, than at another time,
it being well known, that much drawing the Pit, strengthens
the Brine.
