<div class="ocr-text">III. The Extract of another Letter to the same Purpose.

Oxford, Feb. 20. 1694.

Honoured S I R,

I Here send you a Note out of a M.S. Entituled, The History of Pembroke-shire. &#x27;Twas written about the Year 1603. by one Mr. George Owen, a Gentleman of that Country, who seems to have been a Person of considerable Accuracy and Veracity.

Lib. I. Cap. 26. &#x27;About the beginning of June, in the Year 1601. a piece of Ground to the quantity of 200 English Acres, was covered suddenly (as if the same had fallen in a shower out of the Air) with a kind of Caterpillars or green Worms, having many Legs, and bare without Hair. They were found in such abundance, that a Man treading on the ground, should tread upon 20 or 30 of them; and in this sort they continued for the space of three Weeks or more, no Man knowing how they came, nor any of the like sort were ever seen in the Country before, nor since; and being opened, there was nothing found within them but Grass. The place was on a Hill in the Parish of Maen clochog above Hynnon Dhewi. They were found as it were with one accord to go one way, viz. up the Hill, and went over the Hill a quarter of a Mile and more. As they went they devoured and consumed the Grass, that the Ground appeared bare and red like Fallow. And after they had continued there three Weeks, there resorted thither an infinite number of Sea-Mews and Crows, as if all of many Countries had been summon&#x27;d thither, who in few days consumed them all. Also Swine fed upon these Worms eagerly, and waxed very fat, &amp;c.
