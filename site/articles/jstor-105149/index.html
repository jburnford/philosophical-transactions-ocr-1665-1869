<div class="ocr-text">XXXV. A Letter upon the same Subject from the Rev. Richard Pococke, LL.D. Arch-deacon of Dublin, to the Rev. Tho. Birch, D.D. Secr. R.S.

Dear Sir,

Dublin, June 18, 1753.

I Received the favour of your obliging letter; and I return my hearty thanks to the Royal Society for their kind reception of the observations, which I sent them on the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. I am sensible, that it is difficult to make any suppositions on such a subject, that may not be liable to some objections; but I shall be very glad, if mine put any one upon making more happy conjectures.

This day Mr. Drury brought me two maps of the Causeway (see Tab. XI.), one a view from the top of the cliff, and the measures as he pac&#x27;d; the other from my measures by a line; in which the letters answer to those in the engraving after his sister&#x27;s drawing. I have sent them to you, as Mr. Folkes some time ago desired to know how far the Causeway extended into the sea.

I have also sent you four drawings by Mr. Drury, of two curious stones, which I brought to Dublin.

I am,

Dear Sir,

Your most obedient humble servant,

Richard Pococke.

XXXVI.
