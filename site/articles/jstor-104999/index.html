These are more than chimerical notions, and are even demonstrated by experiments; for amber can be produced artificially, as likewise bitumens by the distillation of resinous substances with mineral acids; and there is great probability, that pit-coal might be imitated.

CVI. A Retraction, by Mr. Benjamin Wilson, F. R. S. of his former Opinion, concerning the Explication of the Leyden Experiment.

To the Royal Society.

Gentlemen,

Read June 24, 1756. I think it necessary to retract an opinion concerning the explication of the Leyden experiment, which I troubled this Society with
with in the year 1746, and afterwards published more at large in a Treatise upon Electricity, in the year 1750; as I have lately made some farther discoveries relative to that experiment, and the minus electricity of Mr. Franklin, which shew I was then mistaken in my notions about it.

What I mean by the minus electricity of Mr. Franklin, regards the minus electricity of the Leyden experiment only, which that gentleman discovered.

I shall be very glad to have this acknowledgment made public; and, to answer that end the most effectually, I wish it may have a place in the Transactions of the Royal Society.

I am,

Gentlemen,

London, June 24,
1756.

Your most obedient

humble servant,

Benj. Wilson.</div>
