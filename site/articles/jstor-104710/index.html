An Account of the same, by Jo. Freeman Esq; F. R. S.

Read Feb. 8. 1749-50.

As I passed thro&#x27; the Mews To-day, a little before 1 o&#x27;Clock, I felt a Shock like an Earthquake, and I thought I heard a hollow deep Noise. Several Women thereabouts came running out of their Houses much terrified.

At Leicester-House they were apprehensive the Foundation was giving Way, and were going to send immediately for the Surveyor.

All the Way in my Return home, I saw many Groups of People together, and discoursing upon this Shock that had just happen&#x27;d; some imagining it was occasion&#x27;d by some Houses being blown up in Gold-Lane, where there was a great Fire, and others from some Powder-Mills blowing up; the same thing having been observed about 9 Years ago, from the like Accident at the Mills at Hounslow. If neither of these Causes appear, it can be no other than an Earthquake.
