I have compared these Observations with what I could find relating to the Aurora Borealis in the Philosophical Transactions, &amp;c. and think there are few Particulars mentioned there, but what occurred in this wonderful Instance; some that are rare confirmed, and a few altogether new; but the chief Advantage, I suppose, in these Notes, is the Process, Crisis, and Decay, which is so obvious in many of the most remarkable Scenes.

I have nothing more at present, than the Pleasure of stiling myself,

II. An Account of the same Aurora Borealis, by Mr. Richard Lewis; communicated in a Letter to Mr. Peter Collinson, F.R.S.

Annapolis in Maryland, Dec. 10, 1730.

SIR,

We were entertained with a Phænomenon on the 22d of October last; which, as it was never observed before in this Quarter, was very surprizing to most People.
About Six at Night the North Part of the Hemisphere appeared of a faint Red, the Horizon was very dusky, and this Redness was bounded above by a very dark Cloud.

As the Night advanced this Meteor reddened, till it was of as deep a Colour as Blood; and it spread itself to the North East. It continued all Night, but about Two in the Morning, I observed that it sent forth two and three Streams from its North Part, of a whitish Colour, which shot up to the Zenith. These Emanations looked much like the Rays of the Sun, when they pass through a dark Cloud, when its said to be drawing Water. I took it to be an Aurora Borealis, but it appeared much fainter than those I have seen in England.

Dr. Samuel Chew at Maidstone, tells me, that he has for some Days past, at Morning and Evening, observed several Spots in the Sun, very plainly with his naked Eye, some of which seemed very large.</div>
