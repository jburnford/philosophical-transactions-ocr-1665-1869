Mr. Leibnitz, in some Letters which he wrote into England, intimated that he had a Prospect of a perpetual Motion, founded on the Notion of a Vital Principle, or active Power in Matter. But from the Experiments now mentioned, &#x27;tis evident that if the Force of Bodies in Motion could be exalted even to the infinit&#x27;th Power of their Velocity; yet since, to answer the Phenomena of Nature with Regard to Action and Re-action, the same Force must necessarily be allowed to all quiescent Bodies likewise; it could be of No Effect.

III. Astronomical Observations made at Vera Cruz, by Mr. Joseph Harris. Revised and communicated by Edm. Halley, L.L.D. Astron. Reg. &amp; R. S. S.

The Latitude of this Place I found (by several distant Observations made by a Quadrant of four Feet Radius) to be $19^\circ 12&#x27;$ N.

On March 11, 1727. O.S. there happen&#x27;d here a considerable Eclipse of the Sun, the greatest Obscuration being about 10½ Digits; and having that Morning carefully adjusted the Pendulum Clock, and fixed a Telescope to the Index of the foresaid Quadrant, I observed it to begin in or about the S.E. by S. Part of the Sun&#x27;s Disk at 49½ Minutes after Noon apparent Time; the Altitude of the Sun&#x27;s Center then was $67^\circ 53&#x27;$.

We could not determine exactly the Middle of this Eclipse, but as near as we could judge, it happen&#x27;d about 2h 30m P.M.
The Eclipse ended in or about the N.N.E. Part of the Solar Disk, at $3^h\ 59&#x27;\frac{1}{2}$ P.M. at which Time the Sun&#x27;s Altitude was $28^\circ\ 34&#x27;$.

By comparing these Observations with a Calculation which I made from Mr. Flamsteed&#x27;s Tables, I judg&#x27;d Vera Cruz to lie $97^\circ\ 30&#x27;$ to the Westward of the Meridian of the said Tables.

We had here also a Lunar Eclipse September 29, 1726, O.S. but it happen&#x27;d to be a little cloudy about the Time of its Beginning and Ending, so that we could not get a just Observation.

In the Years 1726, and 1727, I observed here the Magnetick Variation several Times, and found it to be about $2\frac{1}{4}$ Degrees Easterly.

We also observ&#x27;d the Variation several Times on our Voyage from England towards Vera Cruz (having on Board a good Azimuth Compass) but I always found that the best Observations we could make, when compared together, differ&#x27;d so much, that we could not depend upon them, to much less than three or four Degrees, or sometimes half a Point of the Compass.</div>
