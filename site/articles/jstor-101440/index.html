The Reader is hereby advertised, that by reason of the present Contagion in London, which may unhappily cause an interruption as well of Correspondencies, as of Publick Meetings, the printing of these Philosophical Transactions may possibly for a while be intermitted; though endeavors shall be used to continue them, if it may be.

LONDON,

Printed with Licence, By John Martyn, and James Allestry, Printers to the Royal-Society, at the Bell in St. Paul&#x27;s Church-Yard. 1665.</div>
