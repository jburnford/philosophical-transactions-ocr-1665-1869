SIR,

Read March 12, 1772.

I beg leave to lay before you a chart of the Red Sea, constructed from materials that I became possessed of, during my residence in the East Indias; which chart, upon my voyage to Mocha and Judda, I experienced to be the best I have ever seen. The only material error that I ever discovered in it, is, that the Abyssinian shore opposite Mocha is placed too far to the westward by 25 or 30 miles, and that there are several small islands upon the same shore, not taken notice of in any other chart; which islands I have marked in the chart I now send you (See Tab. III.) together with two draughts of the roads of Mocha and Judda (Tab. IV.), which, if you think will be of any utility, are entirely at your service.

I am, SIR,

With the utmost respect,

your most obedient humble servant,

Cha&#x27;s. Newland.
