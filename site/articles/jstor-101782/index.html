<div class="ocr-text">the other. The burnings caused on the paper by both, were very near alike; and I concluded thereupon, that if the burning had any effect in the gout, it proceeded not from any peculiar quality in the Moxa, but only from the burning itself, and that if the burning were made with Cotton, it would produce as good effects as if made with Moxa.

I have taken very near the same quantity of Moxa, Cotton, and the matter which lies within a Chestnut against the red outer skin thereof, and burnt them together one by the other, and I have seen, that they all three, after burning, left behind them an oleous matter; but the Moxa most: Which may proceed from hence, that though there seemed to be the same quantity of all, yet the Moxa held more, it being finer than Cotton, and therefore lying closer together, and consequently yielding more oyl. Whence it appears, that Mr. Busscheff had not so good reason to extol the Moxa and its preparation above Cotton or other the like substances.

Having consider&#x27;d the saying of Chirurgions, that Cotton is fiery and malignant if any wound be dress&#x27;d therewith; I have found, that that fieriness or malignity consists in this, that Cotton hath two flat sides, (as was said above) and consequently every part of it hath two sharp sides, which being thinner than globuls, that make up the Carneous filaments, and being also stiffer than the globular flesh, it comes to pass, that Cotton being laid upon a wound, not only the globuls of the yet sound flesh are annoyed by the sharp sides of it, but also the new matter which is convey&#x27;d to make new flesh, and is yet softer than the flesh already made, is the more easily cut asunder and dissolved; whereas on the contrary, linnen-rags, having roundish parts and many of them lying firm together, and so making up a greater body, are not capable to wound the globular parts of the flesh.

The Description of a Celestial Globe, artificially made, shewing the Apparent Motions, from East to West, and from West to East, of the Sun, Moon, and Fixed Stars: Made by Monsieur Didier L&#x27;Alleman, Master Watchmaker at Paris, and communicated to the Publisher in French, and here by the same made English.

This Globe hath been made conform to the Observations of the most famous Astronomers of this Age, and directed by Monsieur Antonine Agarrat, Professor of the Mathematicks at Paris.
The bigness of it is only of four Inches diameter. The body of the Globe of burnish&#x27;t Steel, where all the figures of the Constellations are designed in Silver-colour, but the Stars themselves of all Magnitudes are put on in embossed Gold.

This Globe moves from East to West in 24 hours; and you may there see the Sun exactly rise and set as in the great World, together with the Moon, as also the Stars of the Constellations; likewise how the Sun of this Globe comes to his Meridian, with an admirable regularity, conform to the Primum mobile.

Besides this, you may there see, that every day the Sun sensibly passeth one degree from West to East, which is its own proper motion finished by him in a year, and thereby describing to us the Inequality of Days and Nights.

Moreover, you may there observe every day the Mean motion of the Moon from West to East, how she increaseth according as she removeth from the Sun, so that it shews visibly the first quarter of the Moon, the end of the second quarter which is the Full; then the third quarter which is the last quadrature, and lastly her Conjunction with the Sun. And thus she is seen to finish every month her Synodical Course; and by her diurnal motion of 24 hours she shews the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, or high and low water.

The Meridian serveth for a Needle to shew the Hours which are marked upon the Zodiack, where the Sun marcheth regularly, which hath two main rays, one whereof goeth directly Northward, the other Southward.

That of the North marks the way or degree, which the Sun maketh from West to East upon the Signs of the Zodiack, and upon a Circle of Silver, where the 360 Degrees of the Circle are marked. The other ray, of the South, marks upon another Circle of Silver the days of the Month, where the 365 days are noted.

This Globe may generally serve for the whole World, seeing you may put it to all the Elevations of the Pole.

The Circles of the Longitude of the Stars, which separate the Signs, and which come from the Poles of the Zodiack, are marked by gold-wires; as also the Equator, the Tropicks, and the Polar Circles.

There is but one great Spring, the primum mobile, which puts all the rest in motion. It is wound up by the Antarctique Pole, and you may wind it up to the right or left hand, without wronging.
wronging any contrary motion. And by the Arctic Pole, you may advance and retard this movement, if you should find any inequality, without altering at all the great Spring.

So far the Description of this artificial Globe; of which we hope we shall very shortly know the price.

A Description of the Diamond-mines, as it was presented by the Right Honourable, the Earl Marshal of England, to the R. Society.

The parts of the World known to contain Diamonds, are the Island Borneo, and the Continent of India extra &amp; intra Gangem: Pegu is likewise reported to have several; but the King not potent, his Country being but thinly inhabited, contents himself with his Mines of Rubies, Saphires, Topasses, Emeralds, Gold, Silver, Brass, Tinn and Lead, and several other Commodities his Country affords, in great plenty, rather than to suffer new enquiries to be made, lest the discovery of such an additional Treasure should invite some of his Neighbours, more potent, to invade him. But leaving the description of other places to those that know them better, I shall only keep myself to the Coast of Coromandel, with which I am acquainted, and having visited several of its Mines, am able to say something thereof Experimentally.

The Diamond-Mines in these parts are generally adjacent to Rocky-hills, or Mountains, whereof begins a great Ledge or Range near Cape Comorin, extending in breadth about 50 English miles, some conjoining, others scatter&#x27;d: and running thence in length quite through Bengala. In among, and near these Hills, in several places, are known to be (as its believed most of them have) Mines; many of them are possessed by petty Princes, or Rajas, of the Hundus; some driven thither for shelter by the Moors, who have taken the greatest part of their Country from them; others never overcome, as the Rajas, on the Hills in and near Bengala, who admit of little or no Commerce with their Neighbours or passage through their Country, which (being barren, in few places affording good water, the ways craggy and very toilsom, especially to an Army) the Moors covet not, but let them enjoy it peacably; yet to prevent danger, they forbid digging (as the King of Pegu does) or dig some few Mines only very privately, so that a great part of the Mines are unsearcht and concealed. But the Kingdoms of Golconda and Visiapore contain</div>
