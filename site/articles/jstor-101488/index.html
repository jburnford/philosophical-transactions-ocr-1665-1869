<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">mention&#x27;d from him in Numb. 4 pag. 67, of these Transacti-
ons.

Prepare (saith he) two Glasses, the one exactly flat on both
sides, the other flat on the one side, and convex on the other,
of what Sphere you please. Let the flat Glass be a little broa-
der than the other. Then let there be made a Cell or Ring
of Brass, very exactly turn&#x27;d, into which these two Glasses
may be so fastned with Cement, that the plain surfaces of
them may lyce exactly paralell, and that the Convex-side of the
Plano-convex-Glass may lye inward; but so, as not to touch
the flat of the other Glass. These being cemented into the
Ring very closely about the edges, by a small hole in the side
of the Brass-ring or Cell, fill the interposed space between
these two with Water, Oyl of Turpentine, Spirit of Wine, Saline
Liquors, &amp;c; then stop the hole with a screw: and accord-
ing to the differing refraction of the interposed Liquors,
so shall the Focus of this compound Glass be longer or short-
er.

But this (adds the Proposer) I would only have look&#x27;t upon,
as one instance of many (for there may be others) of the
Possibility of making a Glass, ground in a smaller Sphere, to
constitute a Telescope of a much greater length: Though
(not to raise too great expectation) I must add, That of
Spherical object glasses, those are the best, which are made of
the greatest Sphere, and whose substance hath the greatest
refraction.

Observations
About Shining Worms in Oysters.

These Observations occur in the French journal of April 12,
1666. in two letters, written by M. Auzout to M. Dela
Voye; whereof the substance may be reduced to the following:
particulars.

1. That M. Dela Voye having observed, as he thought,
some shining Worms in Oysters; M. Auzout, being made acquainted with it, did first conceive, they were not Worms (unless they were crushed ones) that shin&#x27;d, as having not been able then to discern any parts of a Worm; but only some shining clammy moisture; which appeared indeed like a little Star of a bleuish colour, and stuck to the Oyster-shell; being drawn out, shone in the Air its whole length (which was about four or five lines,) and when put upon the Observer&#x27;s hand, continued to shine there for some time.

2. That M. Auzout afterwards, causing more than 20. dozen of Oysters to be open&#x27;d at Candle-light, really saw, in the dark, such shining worms in them; and those of three sorts. One sort was whitish, having 24. or 25. feet on each side, forked; a black speck on one side of the head (taken by him for a Chry stallin) &amp; the back like an Eele, stript off her skin. The second, red, and resembling the common Glowworms, found at Land, with folds upon their backs, and feet like the former; and with a nose like that of a dog, and one eye in the head. The third sort was speckled, having a head like that of a Sole, with many tufts of whitish hair on the sides of it,

3. That, besides these, the Observer saw some much bigger, that were grayish, with a big head, and two horns on it, like those of a Snayl, and with 7. or 8. whitish feet, but these, though kept by him in the night, shin&#x27;d not.

4. That the two first sorts are made of a matter easi&#x27;v resoluble, the least shaking or touch turning them into a viscos and aqueous matter; which falling from the shell, stuck to the Observers fingers, and shone there for the sp c. of 20. seconds: and if any little part of this matter, by strongly shaking the shell, did fall to the ground, it appear&#x27;d like a little piece of a flaming Brimstone; and when shaken off nimbly, it became like a small shining Line, which was dissipated before it came to the ground.

5. That
5. That this shining matter was of different colour; some, whitish, some, reddish; but yet that they afforded both, a light which appear&#x27;d a violet to his eye.

6. That it is very hard to examine these worms entire (especially the white ones) because that at the least touch they doe burst, and resolve into a glutinous moisture; whence also if it were not for their feet, that are discover&#x27;d in their matter, none would judge them to be Worms.

7. That among those, which he observed, he saw two more firm, than the rest, which shone all over; and when they fell from the Oyster, twinkled like a great star, shining strongly, and emitting rays of a violet-light by turns, for the space, (as touch&#x27;t above) of 20 seconds. Which Scintillation the Observer imputes to this, that those worms being alive, and sometimes raising their head, sometimes their tayle, like a Carpe, the light increased and lessened accordingly; seeing that, when they shone not, he did, viewing them by a Candle, find them dead.

8. That forcibly shaking the Oyster-shells in the dark, he sometimes saw the whole shell full of lights, now and then as big as a fingers end; and abundance of this clammy matter, both red and white, (which he judges to have been Worms) burst in their holes.

9. That in the shaking he saw all the Communications of these little Verminulous holes, like to the hole of Worms in Wood.

10. That in more than 20 dozen of Oysters he shook no shell (10. or 12. excepted) but it emitted light: And found some of this light in sixteen of the Oysters themselves.

11. That this light occurs more frequently in big, than small Oysters; in those that are pierced by the Worm, oftner, than in
in those that are not, and rather upon the Convex-side, than
the other; and more in fresh ones, than in the stale.

12. That having somewhat scaled the Convex-side of the
shell, and discover&#x27;d the Communication of the holes, where-
in the often-mention&#x27;d viscous moisture, that has any form of
insects, is found; he smelt a scent, that was like the water of a
squeezed Oyster.

13. That the Worms give no light, when irritated, but if
they do, the light lasts but a very little time, whereas that which
appears in those, that were not angered before, continues a
great while; the Observer affirming to have kept of it above
2 hours.

So far the Journal des Scavans; which intimates withal, that
if the Observers had had better Microscopes, they could have bet-
ter examin&#x27;d this matter.

But since the curious here in England are so well furnish
with good ones, &#x27;tis hoped, that they will employ some of
them for further and more minute Observations of these
Worms; it being a matter, which, joined with other Obser-
vations, already made by some excellent persons here, (espe-
cially Mr. Boyle) upon this subject of Light, may prove very
luciferous to the doctrine of it, so much yet in the dark.

Some Observations
Of the Effects of Touch and Friction.

The Operations and Effects of Touch and Friction having
been lately much taken notice off, and being lookt upon by
some, as a great Medical Branch, for the curing of many di-
seases and infirmities; it will perhaps not be unseasonable to
mention (here also) some Observations relating thereunto;
which may give an occasion to others, to consider this subject
more, than has been done heretofore, and to make fur-
ther</div>
