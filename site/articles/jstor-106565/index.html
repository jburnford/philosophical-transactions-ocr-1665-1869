Of the making and repealing of Laws.

I. For the making of any Law or Statute of the Royal Society, the draught thereof shall be read in Council, and put to the vote, on two several days of their meeting. The first day, the question to be resolved by vote shall be to this effect, viz. &quot;Whether the draught of the said Statute, then agreed upon, shall be read at another meeting?&quot; The second day, the question shall be to this effect, viz. &quot;Whether the draught of the said Statute, then agreed upon, shall pass for a Law, or not?&quot;

II. For the repealing of any Law or Statute, or any part thereof, the Repeal shall be propounded and voted in Council, on two several days of their meeting. The first day, the question to be resolved by Ballot shall be to this effect, viz. &quot;Whether the Repeal of such a Statute, or such part thereof, shall be propounded at another meeting?&quot; The second day, the question shall be to this effect, viz. &quot;Whether such a Statute, or such part thereof, shall be repealed or not?&quot; And in case the said Repeal be agreed unto, the same shall be recorded in the Journal-book of the Council; and the Statute, or part of the Statute, repealed, shall be cancelled in the Statute-book.
