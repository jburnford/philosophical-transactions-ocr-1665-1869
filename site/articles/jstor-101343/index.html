5. To these particulars add the great abundance of Ironstone in Virginia, which hath already been tryed and found very good; the conveniency of Wood and Lime-stone being a good inducement to the making of Iron, which might be done at a much less rate there than here. Of which there hath been a calculation formerly made, considering every man&#x27;s labour, and what is necessary to be disbursed for every Artist and Labourer, as to their transportation, diet, and all other materials for the work of Iron.
