<div class="ocr-text">confirm Dr. Tong&#x27;s. Since the Leaves have been explicated, we have observ&#x27;d the Sycamore after several frosty nights to bleed afresh in the morning, soon after Sun-rising, when it had ceased several days before: though this must not be understood of all Sycamores, but of some only that are more sensible and observant of the Weather.

April 3d. and 4th, all the Sycamores quite ceased.

The 5th, being after a white frost, they began to bleed about 8 o&#x27;clock, and ceased towards noon.

The 9th, 12th, 13th, 15th they bled again.

The 10th, 11th, 14th were not observed.

This 16th they bled not, it being rainy, and the Sun not shining.

From the Observations we have hitherto made, we think it may be certainly inferred, that a morning-sun after a frost will make all the Bleeding Tribe bleed afresh, though they had before ceased; and that this new bleeding towards the latter end of the season commonly ceaseth before morning. Possibly some may bleed after a frost, yet further in the Summer.

I observed last year in August a copious and spontaneous exudation, very like bleeding, of a viscous yellow Juice out of the buds of a black Poplar. Our Walnut-trees bleed here in January.

The Starre-fish, in the last Transactions, is the Stella arboreaens Rondeletii p. 121. first described by him, and since by other Naturalists.

There is no such dwarf-Oak in Old England, growing wild, as was sent you out of New-England, nor in any other Country, where we have been, unless it be the Ilex coccifera, which is a low shrub, bearing large Acorns, and hath a prickly leaf like Holly. If it prove that, it will be a luciferous discovery. —— Middleton in Warwickshire April 16. 1670.

An Account of some Books.

I. Joh. Sig. Elsholtii, Elector Brandenburg Medici, CLYSMATICA NOVA, sive Ratio in venam sellam Medicamenta immittendi. COLONIE BRANDEBURGICÆ. 1667. in 8°.

The Title-page of this Book, but very lately come into England, shews this to be the second Edition: and the Author in the Conclusion of it tells the Reader, that the first Edition thereof was publick A. 1665. at which time he affirms there had been nothing printed (for ought he knew) either by English, French, or Italians, of this argument. To which we shall here say nothing, but refer the Candid Reader to what hath been laid already (by way of vindicating the Invention, both of Infusing Medical Liquors, and of Transfusing Blood, from usurpation)
pation) in several of these Tracts, as Numb. 7. p. 123. Numb. 20. 353
Numb. 22. p. 385. Numb. 35. p. 677, 678, 679, 680, 681.

Meantime, this Author, having collected in this little Tract divers of
the Experiments, made in England, France, and Italy, concerning these
Inventions (of which we might have a far greater stock, and that a very
considerable one, as to that of Infusion, if our Learned and Candid Do-
ctor Timothy Clark, one of his Majesties Physicians in Ordinary, and
a Fellow of the R. Society, could but find the leisure of digesting for the
Press what he hath done on this subject many years ago) discourseth of
the particular Diseases, wherein this Infusing Chirurgery hath been used
with success, and suggests those, to which it might be further extended
with benefit.

II. Nicolai Hobokeni ANATOMIA SECUNDINÆ HUMA-
NÆ, Ultrajetti A. 1669. in 8°.

This Author, intending to inquire more narrowly into all the parti-
culars concerning Humane Generation, premiseth these Observations,
touching the Humane Secundine, lately made by himself, and accompa-
nied with 15 accurate Schemes, drawn, (as he faith) by his own hand,
and representing;

First, in a Female Fetus, the placenta uteri, together with the Mem-
branes and String, on both sides, where the same respects the uterus as well
as the fetus; and more particularly the Membrane Amnios, sever&#x27;d from
the placenta, and the Vessels running through the other Membrane,
Chorion; then, that portion of the string, wherein the laxeness, inequa-
lities and contorsions of the Membrane, together with all the contain&#x27;d
vessels in their proper situation, are observ&#x27;d; next, the Macula, ap-
pearing somewhat prominent in one of the Arteries, by which may easily
be found the passage of the Blood to the Placenta, and its difficult re-
gress towards the Navel of the Fetus; moreover, the interior substance
of the placenta, and all the ramifications of the Veins and Arteries.

Secondly, in a Male-fetus, a review of all the former particulars, toge-
ther with several differences from that of the Female.

To these Observations is subjoyn&#x27;d a Collection of Letters, written by
this Author to divers Learned men, touching Generation, together with
their Answers: in which Collection &#x27;tis intimated, that the Curious may
now expect from Dr. Dimerbroeck, the famous Physitian of Utrecht, his
Anatomy, which by reason of his great practice, and a multitude of other
avocations hath been hitherto retarded.

Joh.
III. Joh. Ludov. Gansii M.D. CORALLIORUM HISTO-
RIA. Francofurti A. 1669. in 12°.

In this History the Author affirms to have digested both what hath been delivered of Corals, and what himself hath observ&#x27;d and try&#x27;d of that curious product of Nature, taken notice of by the Poet, 4. Metam.

Sic &amp; Coralium, quo primum contigit auras
Tempore, durescit, mollis frui herba sub undis.

Which affirmation this Author looks upon as poetical indeed and fictitious, asserting, that Coral is originally a Mineral, and a kind of precious Stone, Corals being no berries petrified, but pieces filed off and turn&#x27;d, from the trunk, round and polish&#x27;t.

His opinion therefore is, that Coral is form&#x27;d out of a glutinous Juice, which being turn&#x27;d into Stone by a salt, abounding in it, riseth up in the form of a Shrub, the salt being the cause, that maketh Plants spread into branches.

The places of the production of Coral he names to be, the Red Sea (where they are darkish,) the Persian Gulf, the Sicilian and Neapolitan shore. Some of them are Red, others White, others Blackish.

To this Account he annexes various Preparations made of them; as also divers Solutions, of which he delivers one as an excellent dissolvent both of Corals and Pearls, made of very well rectify&#x27;d spirit of Salt, digest&#x27;d, and freed of its Corrosiveness, and then mixt with good spirit of Wine distill&#x27;d and brought over the Alembic. May-Dew is also much commended by him for a fit Menstruum, if the spirits distill&#x27;d from it be joyn&#x27;d with its own Salt.

He treats also of the Magisteries, Extract, Oyl, Tincture, Quintessence, Flowers; as also of the Vertues of Corals, and of the way of making factitious ones.
