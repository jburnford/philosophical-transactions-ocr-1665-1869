<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">V. Part of a Letter from Dr. Musgrave, Fellow of the College of Physicians and R. S. to Dr. Sloane; concerning a Piece of Antiquity lately found in Somersetshire.

I Enclose, to you, the Figure (see Fig. 4.) of a curious piece of Antiquity, lately found near Ashelney in Somersetshire; the Place where King Alfred built, as Milton affirms, a Fortress: But according to William of Malmsbury, a Monastery; in Memory (as some have thought) of his Deliverance, obscure Retreat to that Place, and Concealment in it, from the Danes.

The Substance is in the Possession of Col. P. of Fairfield in the same County; by whose Permission, I had the Sight of it. &#x27;Tis of the same Length and Breadth with the Figure: the Work very fine; so as to make some Men question its true Age: But in all probability, it did belong to that great King, it is so well represented in the Figure, that a short Description will suffice.

The Edge is thin, as far as the Letters. The Letters are on a Plane rising obliquely. All within the inner Pyramidal Line is on a Plane equi-distant from the Reverse. The Representation (in that upper Plane) seems to be of some Person in a Chair. It is in Enamel, cover&#x27;d over with a Crystal; which is secured in its place by the little Leaves coming over its Edges. In the Reverse are Flowers engraved. The whole piece may be of the Weight of Three Guineas. The Chrystal and Enamel excepted, it is all of pure Gold.

This, perhaps, was an Amulet of King Alfred&#x27;s.

Exon, Dec. 10. 1698.</div>
