<div class="ocr-text">A Full Description, with the Use, of the new Contrivance for Raising-Water, propounded in the Phil. Trans. No. 173; by Dr Papin, Fellow of the R. S.

There being already six Months, since I did first propound a new way for raising water, printed since in the Philosophical Transactions of July 1685; and nobody having yet unriddled it, I believe it would be needless to conceal it any longer; but will rather, according to my promise, give a full description of the whole contrivance; that the R. S. may be pleased to improve it, and that it may be made use of, by those who may have occasion for it.

Tab. i. Fig. 4. AA is the great Tumbler, that must have some little hole in the bottom as I.

ILL. a slender Pipe hidden by the Chimney-Board BB, whereby the Tumbler AA hath communication with the Pump or bellows MM.

MM. some kind of Pump or Bellows well shut, and having no other aperture, but through the Pipe ILL. These are put in some secret place, where a body may play the same and not be seen.

NN, a slender Pipe, that makes a communication between the glaiss AA, and the crown FF; this Pipe reacheth near to the cover of the crown, that the water contain&#x27;d in it, may not run down by that aperture.

EE the sacrificial Corall hollow within, shut at the bottom, and open at the top.

DDDD two crooked Pipes, foddered to the sides of the Corall EE, so that the water running down the Corall, may spout out through the holes DD.

OO a pipe hidden in the Corall EE, passing through the
the bottom of the same, where it must be well sod-
dered, and reaching near to the bottom of the Rock CC.

PP a Pipe to convey the water from the glass GG into the Rock CC; this Pipe is well soddered to the cover of the sayd Rock.

Q a valve working by a spring at the bottom of the Pipe PP, to keep the water, that gets in that way, from returning back.

R another valve at the top of the Pipe OO, that the water, getting up that way, may not fall through the same.

Now it is plain, that the Rock CC, being fill&#x27;d partly with water, and partly with Air; if we open the bellows MM, the Air from the Crown FF, must run through the Pipe NN, into the Tumbler AA: and thence through the Pipe ILL, into MM to fill the vacuity made therein: the Air in the Crown FF being thus rarified, gives liberty to the Air in the Rock CC to rarify too; by driving the water through the Pipe OO: the water being got up into the Crown FF, runs down the Corall EE, and through the crooked Pipes DDD spouts out at their upper apertures, and from the shells HH; falls upon the Rock CC: if we come afterwards to shutt the Bellows MM, the Air got into their vacuity, must run back into the Tumblers AA, and press upon the water at the top of the Rock CC: but the Air in the sayd Rock, having been rarified, its spring is not sufficient to resist this pressure, and so the water is forced into the sayd Rock through the Pipe PP: and by thus opening and shutting the Bellows MM, the water must constantly circulate by the ways aforesaid.

As for the uses, this way for raising water may be apply&#x27;d to, this I do conceive: the glasses, being merely to conceal the secret, must be left out; and there
may be made severall receptacles above one another to receive the rais&#x27;d water, so as doth the Crown FF: and there should be as many bellows to communicate every one with one receptacle: these bellows should be moved by an Axis, so that when the first is open, the second should be shut; the third open, the fourth shut; and so forth alternatively; which may be easily done: by this means, the first or lowest receptacle would give the necessary supply of water to the second, the second to the third, the third to the fourth, &amp;c. till the water would be rais&#x27;d to the intended height: such receptacles might easily be set twelve or fifteen foot above one another, and so but few of them might raise water to a considerable height, as well as ordinary Pumps do; but this new way would have this advantage, that in the ordinary pumps the strength to be applyed lyeth near the water to be raised, but by this contrivance the stream of a River may be applyed to draw water out of a mine far distant from it: by the same way the stream of the Thames might keep constant water works in Windsor-Castle, as easie almost as in the lowest fields: the River Seine might do the same at St. Germain, and perhaps at Versailles too, notwithstanding the great distance: for it is to be observed, that the Pipes of communication between the bellows and Engine, being meerly for the conveying of the Air, which moves very swiftly, they may be slender enough, and so contain but a small quantity of Air to be rarified; and besides they will not be subject to burst or leak, since the pressure they bear, being all external to the Pipe, will rather strengthen then break the same: from whence it follows, that the lay&#x27;d Pipes need not be strong, but may be made at very small charges. It is also to be observed, that those bellows, that are open, have the Air in them very much rarified, so that the outward Air lyeth heavy upon (to shut) them,
them, by which means the motion of the Engine must be helpt in lifting up the opposite bellows, that are to be opened: and this observation may answer the greatest difficulty that might be objected against this contrivance; so that I don&#x27;t question, but this way for raising water, may on severall occasions be of a great advantage.

As a farther Explication of the use of this contrivance, see Tab. 3. Fig. 2.

AB. AB. Are several Receptacles set above one another, which must be well shutt and foddered every where.

CDD. CDD. Are two slender Pipes, whereby the first and third receptacles have a communication with the Pump HH.

EFF. EFF. Two other slender Pipes, whereby the second and fourth receptacles have a communication with the Pump II.

HH. II. Two Pumps whose plugs are so moved by the Axis LL, that when one goeth down the other goeth up.

MM. A wheel fastened to the Axis LL, that it may be moved by the Stream of a River.

NO. PQ. NO. PQ. Are big Pipes for the water to go up, from a lower into a higher receptacle.

O. Q. O. Q. Are Valves fitted to the top of the forefaid Pipes, that the water may not go down through the same.

Now it is plain that when the Plug in the Pump HH. is going up, the Air comes in through the Pipes CDD, and so it is rarified in the first and third receptacles marked AA: and by that means the water may be driven up into the said receptacles through the Pipes NO. because at the same time the Plug in the Pump II going down, causeth the Air to return to its ordinary pressure in the second and fourth receptacles, that it may be able to drive up the water through the
the said Pipes NO, and the lowest Pipe draws the water that lies open to the Air. By the same reason when the Plug in the Pump II goeth up, the Air must come in through the Pipes EFF: and so it is rarified in the second and fourth receptacles marked BB, and by that means the water may be driven up into the said Receptacles through the Pipes PQ. PQ, because at the same time the Plug in the Pump HH going down, causes the Air to return to its ordinary pressure in the first and third receptacles, so that it is able to drive up the water through the said Pipes PQ.

A Letter from Mr William Cole of Bristol, to the Phil. Society of Oxford; containing his Observations on the Purple Fish.

Gentlemen,

Here being many Naturall things, which I have formerly, and of late, happily found in the South and West parts of England, not (as I can find) published by any Author; besides many more, which have been discovered by the industrious exquisitions of divers ingenious and curious Searchers of Nature; (as also others which were before thought to be Exotiques;) I have reason to believe, that there are very many more (for encouragement of such Inquirers) yet undiscovered in this our Native Country. Among others, that of the Purple-Fish, which I found the last Winter, on the Sea Coasts</div>
