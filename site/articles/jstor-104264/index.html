<div class="ocr-text">XV. Part of a Letter from Mr. J. Derby to Mr. Henry Sheppard, concerning a terrible Whirlwind, which happen&#x27;d at Corne Abbas in Dorsetshire, Oct. 30. 1731. communicated to the Royal Society by Edmund Halley, LL.D. V. Pr. R.S. and Astronom. Reg.

On Saturday the 30th of October last past, about a Quarter before One in the Night, there happen&#x27;d at Corne-Abbas, Dorsetshire, a very sudden and terrible Wind Whirl-puff, as I call it: Some say it was a Water-spout, and others a Vapour or Exhalation from the Earth; but be it of what Name it will, it began on the South-west Side of the Town, carrying a direct Line to the North-east, crossing the Middle of the Town in Breadth two hundred Yards. It stripped and uncovered tiled and thatched Houses, rooted Trees out of the Ground, broke others in the midst of at least a Foot square, and carried the Tops a considerable way. The Sign of the new Inn, a Sign of five Foot by four, was broke off six Foot in the Pole, and carried cross a Street of forty Foot Breadth, and over an opposite House, and dropp&#x27;d in the Backside thereof. It took off and threw down the Pinacles and Battlements of one Side of the Tower; by the Fall of which, the Leads and Timber of great Part of the North Alley of the Church was broke in. The Houses of all the Town were so shock&#x27;d, as to raise the Inhabitants; no hurt was done but only across
across the Middle of the Town in a Line. No Life lost, but Three had a very providential Escape. &#x27;Tis computed by judicious Workmen, that the Damage sustain&#x27;d by this Accident amounts to Two hundred Fifty-eight Pounds, and upwards. It is very remarkable, it only affected, as I have related: no other Parts of the Neighbourhood or Country so much as felt or heard it. It is supposed by the most Judicious, that it began and ended within the Space of two Minutes. &#x27;Twas so remarkably calm a Quarter after Twelve, that the Excise-man walked through two Streets, and turned a Corner, with a naked lighted Candle in his Hand, unmolested and undisturbed by the Air; and as soon as over, a mighty Calm, but soon followed by a prodigious violent Rain. If this Fact be worth relating, I should be glad to know amongst the Learned, what it might be called, or, if to be known, from what Cause it might arise.

Mintern Magna,
Nov. 13. 1731.

Your obliged Friend,
and most humble Servant,

J. Derby.</div>
