<div class="ocr-text">XCIII. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Mylius of Berlin, to Mr. W. Watson, F. R. S. upon the before-mention&#x27;d Subject; dated at Berlin, August 26, 1752.

Read Dec. 14, March 16 past, at a little past 8 in the evening, we had here at Berlin a slight earthquake, which manifested itself by its shaking the ground, the windows, and by opening some doors. This before we have had no example of in our country; and it was perceived at the same time at Stavanger in Norway. I have made experiments of collecting the electricity, during a thunder-storm, with great success, in company with Professor Ludolf. He had erected an iron bar, of twelve feet long, which was fasten&#x27;d upon a pole of wood, fifty feet in height, with two tubes of glass cover&#x27;d with tin. The upper end of the iron bar was sharp-pointed, and near the lower end was fastened a very long iron wire, which being carried into a summer-house, gave great sparks, as the thunder was approaching; and these sparks caused sometimes as violent a shock through the body, as the experiment of Leyden. It was also continually observed, that the effects were greatest, when the lightning was nearest; and that, for some moments after the lightning, the effect ceased, but returned and increased by degrees.</div>
