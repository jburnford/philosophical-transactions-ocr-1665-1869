VII. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Benjamin Cooke F.R.S. to Mr. Peter Collinson F.R.S. concerning the Property of new Flanel sparkling in the dark.

Newport, Isle of Wight, Jan. 13. 1746-7.

Read March 19. Since I have read the Transaction 1746-7. N°. 476. with respect to the sparkling Lady, who could communicate a kind of electrical Fire to her Garments, I can give you an Instance nearly like it, of a Lady who was surprised at such an Appearance from a Flanel Petticoat, which she happen&#x27;d to shake in the dark. But at last we found, that new Flanel, after some time wearing, would acquire this Property; but that it lost it by being washed.</div>
