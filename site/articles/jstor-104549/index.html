There are among the latter some, which have wherewithal to satisfy an Observer, who looks upon them with other Eyes than those wherewith they had been regarded before, and with other Views.

VII. A beautiful Nautilites, shewn to the Royal Society by the Rev. Charles Lyttleton LL.D. F. R. S. and Archdeacon of Exeter.

Sherun May 5. 1748. THIS curious Fossil seems to be composed of a stony Matter like Marble, which has penetrated the Cells of the Nautilus while in its natural State. The Diaphragms or Partitions remain still distinct and visible. The different Colour of the stony Matter in some Cells of a dark-brown or Hair-Colour, in others of a light-brown or Ash-Colour, with the natural Polish of the Outside, gives it a beautiful Appearance; as it is represented in the annexed Print (See Tab. Fig. 2.) where it is drawn of its natural Size in three different Views.

A shews the Side View of it.

But most commonly, after this Fish has been a little while confined, the finny Part of its Tail begins to drop off Piece by Piece; and when the finny Part is all gone, a sort of Mortification seizes upon the Tail itself, and gradually creeps along until it reaches the Intestines, at which time the Fish immediately dies.

The last Roach I had under this Disorder was about the Beginning of January; when in the Space of a Month, it had lost the greatest Part of the Fin, which induced me to clip off the rest, hoping thereby</div>
