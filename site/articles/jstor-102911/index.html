<div class="ocr-text">Then he endeavours to solve another difficulty, raised from the consideration, that the greatest part of the Fibres may be terminated within the Body, and thence to show how these fewer Fibres terminated at the Skin may be sufficient for this evacuation.

That done, he proposes a Paradoxical Problem to be considered, viz. whether all the Fibres in all parts of the Body may not at their terminations naturally form Glandules; and so the whole Body may not be glandulous; and this he doth from three or four considerations.

At last he proposes a method and some means of promoting this Perspiration, when &#x27;tis considerably check&#x27;d. And First he advises Phlebotomy; Then Fasting for a day or two, partly to spend the congested Matter of it, and partly to digest the rest; only he conceives a moderate quantity of thin Liquors useful; and withal thinks, that a quiet composure at this time may be most useful to this end. Thirdly, He advises the use of a Body-brush every morning for some time. Fourthly, if these succeed not, he advises moderate Purging, having first used some Digestives. Fifthly, Since we abound with Volatile Salts (and perhaps our Animal Spirits are little else) he advises a prudent use of them. Sixthly, If yet it proceed not, he advises warm Bathing. But if notwithstanding it proceed not rightly, he proposes, Seventhly, the Use of Cold Bathing. Of all which he assigns, in his succinct way, some reasons.

He concludes with alleging the benefit, that he hath found himself by practising it; but would not have any rely on that, but make tryal of it themselves, since &#x27;tis both easy and pleasant; no more going to it, than to lie quiet in Bed, the Hands covered, for half an hour or longer, after full waking resolving to sleep no more, taking care in the mean time carefully to avoid Sweating, which, tho&#x27; it may have its use in some cases, where serosities abound in the Blood, yet is here ordinarily prejudicial, not only in his Opinion, but Experience in himself.
