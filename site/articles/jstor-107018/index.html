P. 143, l. 3, for affraïant, read effraïant.

Note from Henry Brougham, Jun. Esq. author of the paper on the inflection, reflection, and colours of light. See page 227, &amp;c.

&quot;Owing to an error which crept into the integral calculus by which the problems on &quot;the trajectory of light were resolved, two of these solutions are erroneous, and must be &quot;corrected thus: 1. When the bending force is inversely as the distance, the curves to be &quot;squared are, a conic hyperbola, and a logarithmic, \( y^2 = \frac{x}{l-a} \). The trajectory, there- &quot;fore, cannot be found in finite terms; its equation is \( j^a l \frac{a}{x} = x^2 \); and the sub- &quot;tangent is to the subnormal as 1 to \( l-a \). 2. When the bending force is inversely as &quot;the square of the distance, the curves to be squared are a cubic hyperbola, \( y = \frac{1}{x^2} \), &quot;and a cubic conchoid, \( y^2 = \frac{x}{a-x} \); therefore the equation to the trajectory is &quot;(\( a-x \)) \( j^a = x \cdot x^2 \), which belongs to a cycloid, the radius of whose generating circle i &quot;a. In general, if the force be inversely as the mth power of the distance, the equation &quot;of the trajectory will be \( (a^{m-1} - x^{m-1}) j^a = x^{m-1} \cdot x^2 \), which agrees also with the &quot;first case, where m being = 1, \( a^{m-1} \), may be esteemed the hyperbolic logarithm &quot;of a.&quot;
