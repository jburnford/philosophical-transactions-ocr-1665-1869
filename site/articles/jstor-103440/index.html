<div class="ocr-text">II. Observations of the Eclipse of the Moon, Octob. 10th. 1725. made at Bristol, by John Burroughs Esq; communicated in a Letter to Mr. Chefelden, Surgeon to St. Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, F. R. S.

The cloudy Weather here prevented us from seeing the Beginning of the Eclipse, or of total Darkness; but I observed, pretty exactly, the first Appearance of Light, after the total Darkness, and the End of the Eclipse; and their respective Times are as follows, viz.

Beginning of Light 7 31 20 {apparent Time.
End of the Eclipse 8 29 30

Some small Time before the renewal of true Light, there appeared a remarkable Brightness upon the Eastern Limb of the Moon, which I am not certain how to account for; at first I reasoned with myself in this Manner; That all the Light which the Moon has, during her total Immersion in the Shadow, is by Rays from the Sun, refracted through the Earth&#x27;s Atmosphere, and consequently those Rays must be in greater Plenty, near the Edge of the Shadow, than near the Axis. But this does not fully answer the Phænomenon, because the Light I speak of, was not only upon the Moon itself, (on whose Eastern Limb there was a manifest increase of Light, as she approached the Edge of the Shadow) but it was also diffused about the Edge of the Moon, to a sensible Distance,
Distance, which I would certainly have measured, if I had had proper instruments. And if others, who are more skilled in these affairs, have made the like Observation, I shall no longer doubt of the Moon&#x27;s having an Atmosphere.

Bristol, Feb. 19.
1725.

III. Sceleton duorum Humanorum petrefactorum pars. Ex Epistola Joh. Jac. Scheuczer, M. D. R. S. S. ad Dom. Hans Sloane, Baronettum, S. R. V. Pr.

NOSTI, Vir Expertissime, ex hominum diluvio submersorum genere paucas superstites esse reliquias. Neque ego hactenus in numerosa satis collectione plures habui quam binas dorsi vertebreas, atro-nitentis splendoris, petrefactas. Nunc autem, ἀγαθὴ τοῦ Museolo meo illatum, lapidi fissili Oeningensi immersum λείψανον, omni attentione dignissimum, in quo distincte cernere licet, non vagae imaginationis simulacra, sed capitis humani à quovis alio animantium genere distinctivae partes bene multas, reapse residuas, cranii ambitum, os frontis, osla sincipitis, occipitis, orbitam oculi, baseos cerebri &amp; medullae oblongatae λείψανον, prominentiam interiorum ossis occipitalis, quae cerebelli lobos separat, colli vertebras numero 7, partim denudatas, partim lapideo cortice tectas, &amp; est hæc veluti orthographica sectio posterioris capitis partis.
