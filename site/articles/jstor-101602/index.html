<div class="ocr-text">Some Communications, confirming the present Appearance of the Ring about Saturn, by M. Hugens de Zulechem and Mr. Hook.

The former writeth in a Letter of his, dated at the Hague Octob. 31. 1670. st. n. That he observ&#x27;d Saturn with his Telescope of 22 feet, a little before he came out of France, which was the last Summer of this 1670. and saw his Figure to be very conform to what it should be according to his Hypothesis; viz. the Anæ or Arms to be very narrow, insomuch that their opening appear&#x27;d not but very obscurely.

The sum of it is this in the Authors own words.

Fuit in Asperam Arteriam aer, momento composito cx gravi- tati &amp; vi laterali, eaque Acri, extrinsecus superficiem pectoris circumprimenti, equponderat. Hinc musculis Inspiratorii se contrahendi potentas permittitur, unde Costarum elevatio ac dilatatio, &amp; anta Pectoris amplitude: Tum penitior Acris irruptio, &amp; expansio ductuum pulmonarium; quod totum in Inspiratione contingit.

Mox proprio pondere concidentibus supra tumidum Pulmo- nem costis, spatium Pectoris fit Angustius, &amp; ipsarum ac dia- phragmatis vi Pulmo comprimitur; Aerque partim per os extru-
