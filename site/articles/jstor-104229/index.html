<div class="ocr-text">the Parts, when separated, might be viewed more conveniently; when, to my great Surprize, these imaginary Fibres, as it were, instantly separated from each other, took Life, moved irregularly, not with a progressive, but twisting Motion; and continued so to do for the Space of Nine or Ten Hours, when I threw them away. I am satisfied they are a Species of aquatic Animals, and may be denominated Worms, Eels, or Serpents, which they much resemble. This, if considered, will appear to be something very singular: But I have since repeated the Experiment several times, with the same Success, and gratified others with a Sight of it. I hope these few Discoveries will prove as agreeable to you, as they were to him, who begs Leave to subscribe himself,

SIR,

Your most obedient humble Servant,

Turbervill Needham.
