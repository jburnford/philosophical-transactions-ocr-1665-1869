LXX. A Letter from Benjamin Franklin, LL. D. and F. R. S. to the Reverend Thomas Birch, D. D. and Secretary to the Royal Society.

S I R,

Craven-Street, Feb. 4, 1762.

Read Feb. 4, 1752.

M R. Canton did me the favour to shew me the ingenious experiments he has described in the inclosed letter. They succeeded perfectly as he has related them; and I imagine, the communication of them must be agreeable to the curious in this branch of natural knowledge.

I am,

S I R,

With great respect,

Your most obedient

and most humble servant,

B. Franklin.
