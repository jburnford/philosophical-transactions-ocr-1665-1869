<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">The diameter of the sun, in a horizontal direction, was measured just after the transit, and found to be $= 31&#x27; 30.8&#x27;&#x27;$.

The clock at Savile-House was several times compared with my clock in Surry-Street, from Friday evening, the 5th June, to Monday evening, the 8th June; so that I am as sure of the time at Savile-House, as if the observation had been made at my house in Surry-Street.

XXXIV. Observations on the Transit of Venus, June the 6th, 1761, made in Spital-Square; the Longitude of which is $4^\circ 11&#x27;&#x27;$ West of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the Latitude $51^\circ 31&#x27; 15&#x27;&#x27;$ North; by John Canton, M. A. and F. R. S.

Read Nov. 5, 1761.

Having measured the diameter of Venus, on the sun, three times, with the object-glass micrometer, the mean was found to be 58 seconds; and but $\frac{6}{10}$ of a second, the difference of the extremes *.

* With the same micrometer, the diameter of Venus was measured, off the sun, twelve times, March the 29th, 1758, about noon; and the mean was $1&#x27; 1&#x27;&#x27; 42&#x27;&#x27;$; whence the diameter, at the time of the transit, ought, by computation, to have been $1&#x27; 9&#x27;&#x27; 19&#x27;&#x27;$.
The diameter of the sun, from four observations very nearly agreeing with each other, was $31&#x27; 33&#x27;&#x27; 24&#x27;&#x27;$.

The time, by the clock, of the internal contact, was $8 \text{ h } 17 \text{ m } 4 \text{s}$

Of the external contact - $8 \text{ h } 35 \text{ m } 27 \text{s}$
Of noon - $11 \text{ h } 58 \text{ m } 24\frac{1}{2} \text{s}$

Therefore the apparent time of the first contact, was $8 \text{ h } 18 \text{ m } 41 \text{s}$

Of the last contact - $8 \text{ h } 37 \text{ m } 4 \text{s}$

The two positions of Venus on the sun’s disc, [Vide Tab. VI.] in chords parallel to the equator, were determined by frequently measuring the parts of such chords on each side the centre of the planet, with the object-glass micrometer; which was done with difficulty, both on account of the clouds, and the telescope’s not having an equatorial motion.

Let the arc $ATB$ represent a part of the sun’s limb; let $CFD$ be parallel to it, at the distance of a semidiameter of Venus; and let $OVX$ and $PVY$ be parallel to the equator. At $7 \text{ h } 14 \text{ m } 39 \text{s}$ A.M. apparent time, $OV$ was $14&#x27; 43&#x27;&#x27;$, and $VX$ $5&#x27; 32&#x27;&#x27;$. At $7 \text{ h } 57 \text{ m } 21 \text{s}$, $PV$ was $16&#x27; 36&#x27;&#x27;$, and $VY$ $1&#x27; 56&#x27;&#x27;$.

These observations were all made with a reflecting telescope of 18 inches focal length, which magnified about 55 times.
