V. An Experiment on the descent of Malt dust in the Evacuated Receiver, at Gresham College. By Mr Fr. Hauksbee.

I Took some Malt dust, and having well dried the same, put a quantity of it into a fine Muslin Bag, where being loosely inclos&#x27;d, would upon shaking discover it self plentifully in the open Air, undulating and floating a considerable time before it would descend; but being included within a Receiver, from which the Air was well exhausted; and then shaken, the dust descended as a ponderous Body, precipitating in strait lines from the top to the bottom of a tall Receiver.
