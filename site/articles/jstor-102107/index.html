<div class="ocr-text">Specimen UNIVERSÆ REI NUMMARIE ANTIQUÆ,
Or an Essay towards an universal History of ancient
Coynes and Medals, by Andreas Morellius. Paris in
Octavo 1683.

This ingenious and diligent Helvetian, as a fair
instance what humane industry may effect, if fixt
and resolv&#x27;d, hath already delineated above twenty
thousand different and ancient Coynes, which is a very
considerable part of the sorts reserved in the Cabinets
of the Princes of Europe, and alsoe an admirable ad-
vantage to the Philologist.

This Specimen divides into fourteen Tables, as into
so many curiosities, and is prefac&#x27;t with the just com-
mendation of the Design, and with a short account of
the more famous Collectors of such Antiquity. Amongst
these, since the restoring of Good learning to Europe,
none deserves more honour then Hubertus Goltzius;
who, besides the Coynes of Augustus and others already
published, had drawne off most of the Imperiall, yet pre-
serv&#x27;d in the hands of the worthy Councellour Chiflete.
Occo indeed, and since him the very illustrious Count
de Biragues, have given the world the writing and Mot-
to&#x27;s of severall thousands of old Coynes, yet without
their figures, devises, and moduls. Here alsoe the can-
did Morellius largely acknowledges the favours and sup-
ply of Doctor Charles Patin, the best deserving in that
precious Art of all men now living; and after a due
admiration of the vast store of ancient money and me-
dals in the closets of the most Christian King, and in
severall noble cabinets at Paris, he distributes the whole
stock into these parts or Tomes. 1. The Coynes of
Cities and Kings, before the times of the Caesars, or
at least without reference to them. 2. The Consular
Coynes. 3. Those of the Roman Emperours. 4. The
Coynes of the Hebrews, Phœnicians, Moors, Parthians,
Arabes,
Arabes, Spaniards, Gothes, and others, which either want inscriptions, or are not easy to be interpreted.

Now the series of Coynes of the Roman Emperors, partly Greek and partly Latine, descends from Julius Caesar to Heraclius: for after that valiant, though unfortunate Prince, Barbarity invaded the Mint as well as the Empire. Of these, the Latine are placed, as much as possible, according to order of time. Because after Gallienus, it is very difficult to adjust the money to the years, although Occo hath attempted it. But as to the Greek Inscriptions of the same Emperors, which are indeed the greater number, it is most convenient to place them according to the Alphabet of the Cityes that coyn&#x27;d them; not neglecting the Chronological descent, where it is certain. Yet if the order observ&#x27;d for his private use may better please the skill&#x27;d, he is ready to follow it in the general work. It is this. 1. The Coynes of the greatest size. 2. The Greek after the Alphabet of the several Cities. 3. The Greek bearing the annual Date. 4. Inscriptions Military, Historical and Provincial. 5. Titles. 6. Deities. 7. Virtues, Attributes, and Acts. 8. Tribuneships and Consulates. The Metal, Module, Rarity, and Cabinet, is noted upon each Coyne: and every Copper Plate contains 25 such Coynes: the Geography, Chronology, and Explanation requisite to this large Achievement being added to each Plate. Thus the Preface.

The first Table represents three medals of the greater size. Whereof the first is the Type of the Community of the XIII Cities of Rhodes in honour of the Emperor T. Ælius Hadrianus Antoninus Pius, while Claudius Fronto was Prytanis or Major of Rhodes, Afronha and Pontife: bearing in Reverse the Flambeaux of Ceres drawn by a pair of Dragons, suitable to Ophiusa the more ancient name of that Island. The next large Coyne shews the laureate Crown of Marcus Antoninus, and on the
the contrary part the Musical Orpheus with his charm&#x27;d Brutes. The third opposes to the head of M. Commodus Antoninus, as the consequent and merit of his victories, the harp of Apollo Palatinus.

The second Table likewise gives three large medals: the first suppos&#x27;d of Caracalla or Elagabalus amongst the better Antonines, though perhaps somewhat else, with this special Reverse, ἐπὶ τῷ μετανοιῶντι ἀνδρὶ πρὸς τὸν θεόν; where also the Emperor stands in devotion before Diana Polymanna of the Ephesians. The second shews us Probus arm&#x27;d Capapee, and on the other side Adlocutio Augusti, four Barbarian Princes kneeling below his suggestion.

In the last of this Table we have the curl&#x27;d head of the Platonic Philosopher Apuleius, in a Medail turn&#x27;d like our Mill&#x27;d-money: on the backside is a Souldier entering a porch adorned with three human heads, I believe the Temple of Mercurius Trismegistus. Such Philosophical Medals are by the studious refer&#x27;d to the time of Honorius, not higher.

The third Table affords a golden Coyne of Gallicnus with the vain Reverse Deo Augusto: with a type Divo Trajano Patri, Father of the Emperor of the same name, and well known in the Jewish wars. An history of the Trajans we may expect from the admirable Foy-Vail-lant, who lately published the series of the Syro-Græcian Kings from their Coynes. Next the Community of Asia, under Cleo Prætor of Sardes, represents the adopted brothers Drufus and Germanicus, one with the Armes of an Augur, the other with those of a Pontife.

The next Table shews us the height of the Gentile madness in the Title Deo Augusto round the laureate head of Octavius. So in Divus Pater Trajanus, a person well known in the Jewish war. The following Coyne bears the two adopted brothers Drufus and Germanicus with the Instruments of Augur and Pontife, and on the Re-
verse the Dedication by the Sardians under Cleo their Priest and in the name of the Asian Community. Then two rare and elegant stamps, one of Marciana Trajans sister, reversed with Maltedia blessing her two Daughters and not well represented by Tristan, otherwise the ornament of this Learning: the other of Titiana wife to Pertinax, having on the farther side Victory with L.A. or the first year of that Emperor, who reign&#x27;d but four Months.

The fourth Table begins with a Coyne of the 2 Philips, father and son, and on the averse part Otacilia severa, suppos&#x27;d a Christian Lady. And after represents Trajanus Decius with Herennia Etruscilla, non Saint Orbiana, Empress and their sons, Etruscus and Hostilian. The faces of the next Medail are Aur. Commodus Antoninus, and the parent of Greek Literature ΟΜΗΡΟΣ ΝΙΚΑΙΩΝ, seated on his Parnassus, and thus honored by the Bithynians. The like is done under the same Emperor by the Samians for their excellent Pythagoras, pointing in the Coyne to the Celestial Globe mounted on a Column. Then we have Hero and Leander of the Abydenes from the Cabinet of Cardinal Maximus; and lastly from the Treasure of the French King, the Edessene Governour Abgarus Barmais μήτρα in some Medails, standing and offering the image of Victory, and thereby the Parthian submission, to one of the Gordians sitting on his Imperial Throne. For the Roman Empire consisted of free Cities, Provinces, and dependent Kingdomes.

The next Table commences with Trajane, in the L.IE. or fifteenth year of his Empire saluted by Alexandria bearing (usually) her Elephantine head-piece, and two ears of Corne, noting the Frumentum Alexandrinum. Next you have from the Palace of the present Emperor Leopold three horsemen with Adventus Augustorum, relating to the third Consulship of Severus at
at the end of the Parthian war. Then followes a most specious Coyne of Faustina, wife of the Pious Antonine, consecrated and drawn ex Senatusconsulto by a couple of Elephants. Against the head of Antoninus Caracalla Tr. P. vii. is exprest from a Coyne of the most Christian King, the Triumphal Arche of Severus and Caracalla, to industriously describ&#x27;d from the original structure by Benitius and Bartolus. Passing by Gallienus&#x27;s Vow Jovi Victori, and Probus his reverse Origini Aug. with the Wolfe and first pair of Romans: an Eagle rounded with ΑΦΕΡΩΣΙΣ shews the consecration of ΘΟΛΟΣ ΚΑΡΩΣ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΣ, in a Coyne of Mr. Warner of Berne.

This Table ends with the Felix Proceffus Consulatus vi. of the great Constantine, a rare monument in the hands of the Sieur de Monieux.

The sixt plate begins with Trajane ΣΩΤΗΡ ΤΗΣ ΙΟΛΕΩΣ, meaning the monument of his Dacic Victory, the Nicopolis with her towering head on the Averse. And is succeeded of Julia Pia Augusta, or Julia Domna, mother of the Emperors, mother of the Senate and of the Country.

I omit the arrogant or undeserv&#x27;d titles of Valerian and Gallien, as Restitutor generis humani &amp; conservator pietatis: as also Vespasian&#x27;s Adsertor libertatis publice, within an Oken-wreath: to halter to the Golden medall of the most noble Constantine inscrib&#x27;d Salus &amp; Spes Republicae, stampt at Heraclea, and weighing six ordinary Aurei of the same Emperour. This we owe to the Cæsarean Treasurie at Vienna.

In the seventh we have Nero&#x27;s Jupiter Olympius, Nero&#x27;s Jupiter Liberator C. P. i.e. Coloniae Patrensis, Trajan&#x27;s ΛΕΩΝ ΕΙΝΩΣ stampt at Pergamus, and Domitians Reverse with the Eagle and thunder ΔΙΟΣ ΙΔΙΑ. Then against the head of Titus Vespasianus, that of the Alexandrian Serapis cum modiolo, dated L. I&#x27;. or the third year of Titus. Of the Deity, so propitious to Vespasian, Morellius will give the public in his Great work fourefore different Ectypes,
Ectypes. Considerable are the Apollo Sanctus of Pescenninus Niger, and the Θεός τῶν Ἀθηνῶν of the Nicæans, near of kin to Æsculapius, in a Philosophical habit, behind the head of Antoninus Pius, and lastly the Bonus Genius of Galerius Maximinus, stampt at Alexandria with the ensigns of plenty and a moon crescent.

The eighth Table exposes the Ercules, or Hercules Victor of Æmilian, Nero&#x27;s Hercules Augustus from his Colonia Patrensis, the two Postumi their Libyan Hercules with Antæus, and Erymantian with the bore: then against the head of Aurelius Verus, the serpent Glyco, the devise of the false Prophet Alexander, magnify&#x27;d by the Paphlagonians, especially at Jonopolis, that is Abonopolis, and sufficiently derided by Lucian the Sophiste. Besides these, the Βασίλισσα μεγάλη with a female towering head, the figure of Moneta with her scales and cornucopia, circumscrib&#x27;d with Metalli Ulpiani Pannonici, which mines are yet valuable to the Roman Emperour. And, to conclude, the Victoria Carpica, not Cardica of Philip.

The ix. plate containes Nero&#x27;s Diana Laphria or venatrix with her bowe, Diana Leucophry&#x27;s Polymanna of the Magnesians in honour of Hadrian, a very beautiful figure of Ἡρα ἐπὶ ἀγῶνα with Neros head on the front, the Nemesis of Tianum with a wheele at her feet, an excellent Ectype of the Temple of Venus Paphia amongst the Sardians, and on the back of Salonina an inscription and statue Beneri genetrici, as in ancient Coynes occurs. Jubentus, Bolcanus, Renobatus, Bixit, &amp;c. This deity Julius Cæsar honour&#x27;d with a Breastplate made with Brittish Pearls. Then Hispania with a rabbet at her feet (Saphan in Hebrew: whence the Learned Bochart derives the name of the Country) stampt in the second Consulate of Antoninus Pius, and at last in honour of Maximian, Gaudete Romani. Sic xx. sic xxx. upon the Tricennialia of the Prince.

The tenth Table first honours Augustus Cæsar with CEBACTΩΣ ΚΤΙΘΗΣ of the Nicopolitans, a hofe
ensigne was the head of the Calcydonian bore; and also with a stampe at Mylasa ἡγεμονίας τῆς οἰκείας, referring to the storys of Labienus reported by Strabo lib. xiv. Then we have two Coynes of Gallicus embellish&#x27;d with the dignity of Sida metropolis of Pamphylia: and against the head of Aur. Antoninus Sagalassus of the Lacedæmonians, Plenty crowning that Emperor: and on the reverse of Gordian, Seleucia ad Calycadnum libera, a fair Greek Coyn amongst the many of the French King.

The xi. Table begins with a Greek Coyn of Antoninus Pius ii. ii. reversed with the image of Tarsus metropolis of Cilicia, holding ears of corn in her right hand, and treading upon the river Cydnus. The next expresses Commodus&#x27;s Laodicea, the rivers Lycus and Caprus running beneath: then Severus his Diana of the Ephesians, beset with the waters of Cayster and Cenchrius, amongst the rarities of the famous Patin: and averse from Julia Domna, the river Rhodius of the Dardanii; and also in another Coyn of the same Lady, Sagartis of the Nicaeans, and opposite to Geta, Scamander of the Illyrians. And concludes with a Coyn of Hadrian, whose reverse shews Marysas Cibotus Apamenium: near which part of Phrygia some will have Noah&#x27;s Arke to rest, as the learned Falconerius in his discours de Nummo Apameni.

In the xii. Table, behind a cut of Trajan is ἐπιτύχειν ἀγαθόν. L. K. or in the 20. year of his Empire. Then a copper Coyn of Otho with ἐπιτύχειν, bearing a cap on her head and a garland in her hand. A medal of Antoninus Pius with the Egyptian εὐγνώμων, holding corn in her apron, and leaning upon a Sphinx, stampt L. B. Next Hadrian&#x27;s Fortuna Spes cos. i. i. i. upon the adoption of Ælius Caesar. And also Commodi magnificentia; and yet higher, The world is happy in Commodus, say the Nicaeans, ἐπιτύχειν ἀγαθόν ἐπιτύχειν ἀγαθόν. To this, an excellent Coyn of Caracalla, rever&#x27;d with the four boyes for the seasons of the year, ἐπιτύχειν ἀγαθόν, bearing the flowerbasket of the spring, the sickle of summer, the grapes and hares of autumn, and the close garment of winter. And in the 3d. Consulate of Hadrian, a golden Coyn with Jupiter in a circle, bearing a bird or Phoenix on a globe, and underneath Secula aurea.

The xiii. and xiv. Tables contain several ancient Games, as the Asclepia, Soteria, Isthmia and Pythia of Caracalla at Ancyra. Then Commodiana of the Nicaeans: and Severiana of the Perinthians and the Philadelphia of the same. Next Severiana and
Philadelphia of the Niceans: the Olympia and Pythia under Julius Caesar in the reign of Caracalla; and in the time of Gordian the Capitol of Thebailonica: most of these represented with their urns and palms. The Theogonia Occumenica of Valerian, in the possession of Mr Nedham an English Gentleman. The Argon Comediarum Occumenica at Tarsus, Hadrians Athan Pincentia: and that memorable Coin in the third Consulate, and xii. Tribunship of Severus, where Bacchus and Hercules stand circumscrib&#x27;d with Ludos Seculares fecit, to wit anno Romae 950. Chrifti 205. Chilone &amp; Libone coifl: 15. years after Domitian&#x27;s Seculars, as Censorinus rightly: not c x: as Zosimus reckons.

The 15. Table affords Cyzicus King of Propontis: Rex Juba Junior, and his wife Cleopatra, Daughter of Antonius Cleopatra: and a rare head of a Parthian King with the glorious Titles of Caesaris Caesaris apudim d&#x27;apudim d&#x27;apudim quinque. And lastly a Coin of Joseph fil. Job Salahodin, the scourge of Christianity, and occasion of the Decimae Saladinae decreed in the Council at Paris 188. This and 60. other Arabic medals are preserv&#x27;d in the Library of St Genovefe at Paris.

The 16. Table commences with a rare Greek Coin from the Euxine ουσια της, and on the back a bunch of grapes ποιμαντος. And followed with the horned head of Oris Apollon, named from Ham Noah&#x27;s son, the stampe of the Mytilenians under the Praetor Valerius Aristomachus: this with the figure of the Senatia imperatoris or the Senate, viz a Senators head wreathed, like to the description of the same in Dio. And at last a choice Coyne of ἀποκριται, enclosing in a garland their feasts and playes in honour of Latona, ἡμεων ποίησις, meaning the Meandrian Tripolis. As for Hebrew Coynes he finds very few genuine in the Princes cabinets; but many Punic and Parthis. Of French Coynes the illustrious Harley hath the best store: and Ant. Augustinus will serve well for the Spanish. Then he shuts up his Specimen with 4. Coynes, viz: Offa rex Mercorum, Votae Hispanorum, Obulo Hispanorum, and a Punic Coyne with a sow and pigs, and with characters like the Samaritan Besides, two learned letters of his Excellence Ezekiel Spanheim honour this Specimen.
An account of the reprinting of Johannes Goedartius DE INSECTIS; cum Appendice ad HISTORIAM ANIMALIUM ANGLIAE, by Martin Lister M.D. and F.R.S.

It was desired that Goedartius and the Notes I had added, might be again printed in Latin, which for some reasons I suffered; and put it into the hands of one to do it, who had performed it better, but that sickness prevented him in the Task.

Having yielded that, I was willing to print with it a second Edition of the Appendix to the History of English Animals, having some few things with two Plates of Figures to add, which are new, besides amendments.

Also not knowing, but I might be prevented myself either with sickness, or otherwise, I did permit the same Stationer to print off 4 Plates more, which I had by me, very exquisitely designed, of the Beetles of England; and having not the leisure to transcribe and perfect the Trait to which they belonged, I did neither number, nor explain them, and therefore I call them Mute Tables: yet I am desirous thereby to encourage, and recommend even bare and naked designs of the things of Nature; that such persons as are wealthy and much at leisure, and are only willing to please themselves with elegancy of Picture, may do good to posterity, in seeing that part of Natural History well performed, which otherwise is scarce in the power of private men; whose industry and studies are very often at a loss for want of that necessary help; which if well done, might be by them referred too.

In the Appendix, besides the additions, the whole genus of Husculi fluviatiles is new described with more exactness.

Also the Pholas kind (that is, a certain sort of shell-fish) fall inclosed, and that naturally, in submarine Rock&#x27;s
is much enlarged, and the Animals themselves are figured in some of them: by which a great objection is answered, of those who assert equivocal generation, for that these are inclosed in the Rock, every one in a single hole of its own making, so that it was difficult to imagine how they could copulate; but by the figure we are eased of this doubt, for each Animal hath a long body naturally exerted and extendable to a great length, as may be seen if they are put alive into water; so that we may well imagine, they couple not unlike earthworms, which come out of the ground for that purpose, and extend as much of their body as is necessary to meet a Mate; which if it happen to be near, their bodies are most within the ground, if farther distant, they are accordingly extended.

And after this manner we must think of the Solen kind; which are a sort of shell-fish deep bedded in sand, as the other is in the Rock: these, I say, rise up at certain seasons, and by the like body extended, copulate.

AN ADVERTISEMENT.

All persons that have the Volumes of these Translations entire, are desired to add a stroke in the title page of the preceding one to this, and make it the XII Volume; Mr. Oldenburgh having published 4 Translations after his Eleventh Volume, to which, the six, let forth by Dr Grew, being added, as indeed they ought, for that they carry on the old number; they may well pass for the XII Volume: so that the two last, for the years 1683 and 1684 must be accounted the XIII and XIV Volumes.
