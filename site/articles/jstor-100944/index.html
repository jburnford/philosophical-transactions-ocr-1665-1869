<h2>Full Text (OCR)</h2>
<div class="ocr-text">COMETIS scripsit ediditque, saith, Cassini Tabulas (refractionum) &amp; rationibus &amp; Experimentis esse conformes.

But Ricciolus, in a late treatise Astronomiae reformatae, hath raised an Expectation of his new Tables of Refraction, and questions those Tables of Cassinus: Who, in this Letter, answereth his objections, and shews, how, by observations in Heliometro, we may try whose Tables are best.

The second Letter is in Italian, to Carlo Rinaldini Professor of Mathematicks in the University of Padua, dated August 7, 1666.

In it, He shews some defect in the wayes of making Experiments of Refraction, prescribed by Vitello, Des-Cartes, Riccioli and Manzini. And then he describes an Instrument of his own invention for that purpose, &amp;c.

The third Letter is in Italian also, but without date: concerning a book of Dr. Mengoli; wherein is a Table of Refractions for every degree of altitude. But Cassinus shews, that Table of Mengoli to be false; as being easily refuted by Experience, and grounded upon a wrong foundation. Most writers of Dioptricks since Des Cartes do agree with him, in acknowledging a constant Ratio in the Sines of the Angles considered in Refraction. But this Doctor Mengoli, mistaking those Angles, hath cast away a great deal of labour in calculating so many Refractions, and so making a Table full of false numbers. But Cassinus hopeth, that Signor Mengoli will review his Principles, and put true ones in their room, that so beginning anew he may reform the Conclusions, which he intended to demonstrate.
