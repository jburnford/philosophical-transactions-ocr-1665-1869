SIR,

PERSONAL Friendships and Favours are become the trite Topics of Dedications and public Addresses, as if it concerned the Public to have upon Record the mutual Regard, private Persons may have to each other: Therefore without expatiating here, so far as Gratitude might lead me, on the many Favours you have honour&#x27;d me with, I shall confine myself to the Relation Your Illustrious Grandfather had, and Yourself have, to the Royal Society.

No sooner were the Sciences revived at the Beginning of the last Century, and that Natural Knowledge began to be thought a Study

and when prevailed on by Friends to impart some† of them to the Public, he concealed his Name; not being solicitous of the Reputation they might reflect on their Author: The same Principle in you still induces you not to withdraw the Veil; it having always been a Maxim with both him and you, *Prodeesse quam conspici.*

The Cloud that was gathering over his native Country, warned him and his Father to seek a quiet Retirement in the new World,

English Settlements, NEWENGLAND, of which his Father the Honourable John Winthrop, Esq; the Elder, was the first Governor.

The Fatigues of this great Undertaking took up too much of his Time, to allow him all that Leisure that was wish&#x27;d for by his learned Friends in Europe, for his publishing many curious Pieces which they had Reason to expect from him. His distant Abode from London, and his not putting his Name to his Writings, made him not so universally known as the Boyle&#x27;s, the Wilkins&#x27;s, or the Oldenburg&#x27;s of his Days, nor his Name handed down to us with such general Applause. In Concert with these and other learned Friends, (as he often revisited England) he was one of those, who first form&#x27;d the Plan of the Royal Society; and had not the Civil Wars happily ended as they did, Mr. Boyle* and Dr. Wilkins, with several other learned Men, would have left England, and, out of Esteem for the most excel-

lent and valuable Governor, JOHN WIN-
THROP the younger, would have retir&#x27;d to
his new-born Colony, and there have establish&#x27;d
that Society for promoting Natural Know-
ledge*, which these Gentlemen had formed,
as it were, in Embryo among themselves; but
which afterwards receiving the Protection of
King CHARLES II. obtain&#x27;d the Style
of ROYAL, and hath since done so much
Honour to the British Nations, as to be
imitated by the several European Princes,
who desir&#x27;d to be esteem&#x27;d the Patrons of
Learning.

WHEN the Royal Society was thus founded,
it was his constant Care to shew a peculiar
Regard to promote the Design of its Institu-
tion, by sending over many Specimens of
the curious natural Productions of those
Countries, and by communicating in Writ-
ing his Remarks upon them; some of which
grace the earliest of our Transactions: And

Order of the Royal Society, Mr. Winthrop

College at Cambridge in New-England, since known by the
Name of Harvard-College.

You, Sir, have imitated the Example of your worthy Ancestor: Your Regard to the Royal Society shew&#x27;d itself from your Youth; you having sent to England many rare Curiosities for the Museum of the Royal Society, which, although by the Disingenuity of the Pilot they miss&#x27;d their Port, and were not laid up in the intended Repository, are some of them to be seen in a recent Museum now at Cambridge.

When the Injustice and Ingratitude of a designing Party in Power among that very People, whereof the Winthropes have always been in the most strict Sense the Fathers, the Patres Patriæ, had most cruelly driven you from your Family

and Native Soil, to seek Justice and Security in your natural Rights from the Hands of our most Gracious Sovereign; amidst the Vexation of the greatest Abuses, and the Hurries of the most sudden Departure, you were not unmindful of the Royal Society; for soon after your being chosen a Fellow, you increas&#x27;d the Riches of their Repository with above Six hundred curious Specimens, chiefly in the Mineral Kingdom, accompanied with a List containing an accurate Account of each Particular; thereby shewing your great Skill in natural Philosophy, and at the same time intimating to England the vast Riches which lie hidden in the Lap of her principal Daughter. Since Mr. Colwall, the Founder of the Museum of the Royal Society, you have been the Benefactor who has given the most numerous Collection; and it is to be hoped your generous Example will be followed by some of the present Members, by which means our Repository may soon become one of the most conspicuous in Europe.

The extraordinary Knowledge, you have in the deep Mysteries of the most secret Hermetic
