An Experiment
Of making Cherry-Trees, that have withered fruit, to bear full and good fruit; and of Recovering the almost withered fruit.

Communicated by the same, as follows:

A Nno. 1665, I made the following Experiment with 3 May-cherry-Trees (planted in a rich Mould) which lay to a South-wall, shaded 4 Winter-Months from the Sun by a high Building, so that the Sun came not on them, till the beginning of March, when being high, and shining somewhat fiercely upon them, the fruit constantly withered for some years before. Now this year, the season being very hot and dry, I bared the roots of one of them, by making a hole about it, and watered it every Morning and Evening with about a Gallon of water, for about a fortnight before the Cherries came to redness, and the fruit was full and good. The other two Trees, left without this ordering, had most of their fruit withered, having only skin and stones. Now to try this Experiment farther, I made a hole round about one of the other Trees, and fed it with water daily, as the former: In a Weeks time, those that were quite withered, fell off, and the rest, that were not so, grew and increased exceedingly; the other Tree, that was not used after this manner, had not any of its fruit come to perfection.

An Experiment
On Aloe Americana Serrati-folia weighed; seeming to import a Circulation of the Sappe in Plants, by the same Dr. Merret.

August 4, 1656, this Aloe weighed 21 ounces, 6 Drams, 2 Grains. Its colour was of a pale-green, consisting of 11 Leaves; it was bound about with a red dry Cloth, and was hung up without Oil, as is usual, in the Kitchin.
