And he did intend (had he lived longer) to perfect it further; by omitting some things which (though here he notes as defects) he found after to be done already, and supplying some others. But he lived not to perfect it, and therefore (that it be not lost) we here give it as we found it.\n\nOXFORD,\n\nPrinted at the THEATER, and are to be sold by Moses Pitt, at the Angel, and Samuel Smith, at the Princes Arms in St. Paul's Church-yard LONDON. 1684.",
