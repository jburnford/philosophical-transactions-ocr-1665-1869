Wood of Nepe-care-street in Wrotham, he was troubled with a Quinsie, he neglected Advice till he could hardly swallow any Liquid; and when I went to see him, I found the Tumour tend to Suppuration inwardly about the Root of his Tongue on the Right Side, though it was almost as big as an Egg outwardly, but without any Sign of Suppuration there: Wherefore I ordered him Maturating Gargles; and the next Day sent my Man, and bid him advise him to endeavour to break it with his Finger, which the Man effected, and brought out of his Mouth near the Quantity of a quarter of a Pint of Matter, and with it at last the Stone; he had likewise a Ranula, and before he had broke the Tumour, and spit out the Corruption he could hardly speak. I believe this Stone to be of the same Nature as those generated in the Kidneys and Bladder.\n\nThe Weight of this Stone in Air is 7 gr. The Weight of the same in Water is 3½; and its specific Weight compar'd with Water is near as 1 3/5 2/3 to one.",
