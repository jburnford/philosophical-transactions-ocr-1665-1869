If then Pain happens to be an Attendant of a Rupture, wherein the Omentum is concern'd, and the Parts so inflamed continue in Contact, that is, if the Parts prolapsed in a Rupture are not soon reduced, they will swell in the Bag, and be knit together, and by filling up the Opening, by which they had prolapsed, choak up the Passage, clog and prevent the returning back, compress the Guts under the Pressure, and strangulate them more and more, in proportion as their Bulk shall increase, so long as the Fluids can flow into the compress'd Canals; in which at last they stagnate, and upon Extravasation suppurate, or the Mortification of the Parts compress'd ensues.\n\nIII. An Account of a Pin taken out of the Bladder of a Child, by Mr. William Gregory, Surgeon; communicated in a Letter to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. Pr. R. S.\n\nBrompton near Chatham,\nJan 4. 1733-4.\n\nI Was call'd to the Assistance of a Woman in Travail. The Foetus presented in a transverse Position; I soon recover'd the Feet, and in a few Minutes deliver'd the Woman. The Funiculus Umbilicalis was\nso short, that it was with Difficulty I could make a Ligature upon it, in order to make a Separation: I immediately extracted the Secundine, and measured the Funiculus, which was little more than four Inches long. As soon as the Woman was taken care of, I examin'd the Child, which I found to be imperfect in several Parts, there being no Anus, neither Privities to distinguish of what Sex it was: Where the Vulva should be, there was a small Perforation, (though no Appearance of Labia) through which the Urine always pass'd away; there was likewise a large Hernia Umbilicalis, and a little lower in the Linea alba, was a Perforation, into which the Intestinum rectum open'd, and there the Excrements pass'd during the time the Child liv'd, which was almost ten Weeks. Several Days before the Child died, a Gangrene appear'd on the Hernia, which soon pass'd into the Intestines, and occasion'd the Child's Death: The Hernia, in my Opinion, was occasion'd by the Shortness of the Funiculus, which did not grow in Length proportionable to the Fœtus; the Child in all other Parts was perfect. When the Child died, I had Liberty from the Parents to inspect into it: I did not go through a regular Dissection; I only inspected into the Intestinum rectum, (which I found as above describ'd) and the urinary Bladder, which I found very small, and no Urine in it; the Child was never observ'd to make Water in a Stream whilst it liv'd, which makes me of Opinion, the Sphincter Vesicæ was imperfect. In handling the Bladder, I found something sharp pointing to my Finger; I could not discover what it was, until I snip'd off the Neck of the Bladder: I then took\ntook out of the Bladder a tough kind of Substance, about as big as a small Fig, in which was a Pin with the Head on, and very black; the urinary Bladder, Pin, and viscid Substance, (though now somewhat wasted) are here preserv'd in Sp. Vin. R. The Case, in my Opinion, being very extraordinary, occasion'd my giving the above Account of it, which I declare to be Truth, having open'd the Child in the Presence of several Spectators. Witness my Hand,\n\nWm. Gregory.\n\nIV. A Letter from the Marquis de Cau-\nmont to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. President\nof the Royal Society, containing the De-\nscription of a very extraordinary Stone\nor Calculus taken out of the Bladder of\na Man after Death; translated from the\nFrench by T. S. M. D. F. R. S.\n\nAvignon, June 30. 1732.\n\nSIR,\n\nYOU have an indisputable Right to all the Wonders of Nature: They have, in some manner, recourse to your Tribunal: For where can they be examined with such Judgment? This is my Motive for communicating to you the Figure of an uncommon Stone found lately in the Bladder of a dead Body, which I had engraved in my own Pre-",
