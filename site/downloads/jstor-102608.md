informs us, That formerly in Dissecting the Body of a Woman, who supposed herself to be Three Months gone with Child; he found the Womb very small, not larger than in Virgins, and a hard Substance in the Right Horn, which being opened, appeared to be the Skeleton of an Infant, with the Navel-string, smeared round with a white Matter, not unlike Plaster, which he shewed to M. Du Verney, and other curious Persons.

IV. An Observation of some Parelii seen at Canterbury. By Mr. Stephen Gray.

February the 26th, 1695, being Sunday, about half an Hour after Three in the Afternoon, chancing to look out of a Window that faced South-East, I saw not far from the South to the Westward, an Appearance of somewhat not much unlike the Sun, when seen through Clouds, viz. with its Periphery not exactly defined, from which it likewise differed, in that one half of it was coloured deep Red and Yellow, the other White. I went immediately into the Garden, taking a Theodolite with me, in order to take its distance from the Sun, which the room would not permit; but was then presented with an Appearance exactly like the former, but on the opposite side of the Sun; I took the distance of this from the Sun, which was 23 degrees to the Westward; but before I could take the distance of the Eastern one, it Vanished, but soon after Re-appear'd, and then I perceived manifestly, that they were both situate in the extremities of a Semi-circle
circle, whose Center was the Sun, passing betwixt it and the Zenith. This Appearance continued about half an Hour.

Des Cartes in his Book of Meteor, calls such Phenomena Parhelia, or Mock Suns, and gives us the History of Five seen at Rome, in the year 1629. March the 20th, and Demonstrates, that there may sometimes, according to the Laws of Refraction and Reflection, appear Six at one time, viz. Five mock Suns, and the true one.

I chanced to be at home alone, and saw no Body to whom I could impart what I saw, till after the Mock-Suns vanished, nor do I hear of any, but myself, that saw them; yet may you be certain, that I have not deceived myself or you.

V. A Supplement to the Account of a Scolopendra Marina, &c. Described No 225. of these Transactions. By Dr. Tho. Molyneux, F. R. S.

I find a Letter (Philosoph. Transact. Numb. 249.) of Mr. Dale's to Dr. Lister, wherein he mentions the Scolopendra Marina I gave an Account of, Numb. 225. of the Transactions, as described by Rondeletius, under the Title of Physalus, in his Book, De Piscibus; but I must crave leave to differ from him in Opinion as to this Particular: For I conceive that Author could not understand by the Name of Physalus, what I mean by Scolopendra Marina, è mare Hybernicò, &c. but some other
