one of the stomachs of a calf, brought forth dead at the full time, of the same colour with those on its skin. As this observation renders the proof, however clear and unexceptionable it was before, fuller, I was unwilling to omit it here.

I have made use of the agaric in four amputations: the first was on the arm, between the elbow and wrist; the second and third were below the knee; and the fourth on the crural artery. In every case it answered beyond my expectation; the patients had little or no fever, and no spasms at all, which are frequently the consequences of the ligature, and sometimes fatal. I am surprised, that any objections are made to the use of it. I fear the true reason of its not being used in general practice proceeds from a narrow selfish way of thinking; but it is my opinion it will make its way, to the honour of its first author.

N. O N telescopio, sed tubo optico sat- tis claro & longo, hoc lunare deli- quium observavi: eclipeos tamen initium, vel in- strumentorum debilitate, vel usus defectu, accurate determinare vix potui. Ne tamen apparentias pro veritatibus acciperem, initium non nisi quando de eo nemo claræ mentis & visus dubitare poterat annotavi. Idem de fine dicendum; veruntamen tempus a me datum pro proxime certo haberi poteat. Pro certo, inquam, non respective ad tempus verum, quia qua- drante, & meridiana fixa certa destituti sumus; sed ad tempus à solari nostro horologio horizontali indi- gitatum. Fatemur tamen hoc horologium solare, secundum regulas gnomonicas, aut non exactè de- scriptum, aut non perfectè locatum nobis videri.
