When the Silk is dry, the Feather once made electrical, so as to be repell'd by the Tube, retain'd that Virtue above two Hours in frosty Weather; but in moist Weather lost it in half a Minute.

V. Extract of a Letter from the Hon'ble Edward Legge, Esq; F. R. S. Captain of his MAJESTY's Ship the Severn, containing an Observation of the Eclipse of the Moon, Dec. 21. 1740. at the Island of St. Catharine on the Coast of Brasil; communicated to the Royal Society by the Rev'd Jos. Atwell, D.D. F. R. S.

Dec. 21. 1740.

Read Jan. 21. "I observed an Eclipse of the Moon, which began very nearly at five Minutes after Seven; but the Horizon being hazy, I could not observe exactly the Beginning: However, it ended exactly to a Moment at 50 Minutes after Nine. I set my Watch by two Observations before, that I might be exact in Time, and confirm'd it by one after; so that I believe I may venture to say it was right: And I observed with one Telescope on board, and sent another on Shore, which agreed exactly together."

This Eclipse was observed at the Island of St. Catharine, on the Coasts of Brazil; and the Captain places the said Island in Latitude 27° 30'. Mr. Gael Mor-
Morris has calculated the said Eclipse; and the Middle of it, apparent Time, at Greenwich, was,

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{h.} & ' & " \\
11. & 44. & 50.
\end{array}
\]

By the Captain's Observation, supposing the Beginning exact,

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
8. & 27. & 30.
\end{array}
\]

Difference of Meridian

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
3. & 17. & 20. \\
= 49° 20'
\end{array}
\]

The End of it, by Calculation at Greenwich

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{h.} & ' & " \\
13. & 06. & 57.
\end{array}
\]

—by Capt. Legge's Observation

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
9. & 50. & 00.
\end{array}
\]

Difference of Meridian

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
3. & 16. & 57. \\
= 49° 14'
\end{array}
\]

Capt. Legge observes, that in attempting to pass Cape Horn, they thought themselves to have been more to the Westward than they really were: By which Mistake, turning too soon to the North, they fell in with high Lands, and met with those Misfortunes, which, if they had kept out more at Sea, might probably have been avoided. By comparing the Longitude at St. Catharine's as above settled, with Senex's Maps, the Coasts appear to be placed about 6 Degrees too much Eastward; and if the other Parts of America about the Cape are laid down as faultily in the Charts, this Error will probably account for their Misfortunes.
