The Number of Mean Lunations contained in any given Quantity of Time; (3.) The Number of Troy Pounds contained in any given Number of Avoirdupoise Pounds, and vice versa; (4.) The Quantity and Weight of Water contained in a full Pipe of any given Height, and Diameter of Bore; and consequently, to find what Degree of Power would be required to work a common Pump, or any other Hydraulic Engine, when the Diameter of the Pump-bore, and the Height to which the Water is to be raised therein, are given. Communicated by Mr. James Ferguson, F. R. S.\n\nRead Feb. 7, 1765.\n\nSome time ago, just as I was finishing a table for shewing the quantity of time contained in any given number of mean lunations within the compass of 6000 Julian years, intending thereby to examine how near our present astronomical tables would shew the times of some antient eclipses which we have on record, when the proper equations of the solar and lunar motions were taken\ntaken into the account; I was visited by my friend William Rivet, Esq; of the Inner Temple, who said he wished he had come sooner, because he could have put me upon a much shorter method of computation. I desired him to shew me his method, which he did most readily and cheerfully. \"It was only to reduce the odd hours, minutes, seconds, and thirds, &c. above the integral days of a lunation, into the decimal parts of a day; which number be of days and decimal parts, being nine times added together, will be equal to the time contained in nine mean lunations. And from these, the time contained in any other assigned number may be found, as follows.\n\nA Table shewing the quantity of time contained in any given number of mean lunations. The mean lunation being 29 days 12h 44' 3\" 2' 58\"\"; or 29.53059085108 days.\n\n| Lun. | Days.

But in practice, it is sufficient to take in four or five of the decimal figures.\n\nHaving got this hint from Mr. Rivet, I reversed it into a way of finding the number of mean lunations contained in any given quantity of time; for which purpose I calculated the following table, upon the above length of a mean lunation; which comes the nearest to the truth of any length I have yet found, when carried back from the present times to the recorded times of antient eclipses, if the proper equations depending upon the anomalies of the sun and moon are applyed to the mean times of new and full moons.\n\nA Table\nA Table shewing the number of mean lunations contained in any given quantity of time.\n\n| Y. | Lun.

The first of which is, to find the number of troy pounds contained in any given number of avoirdupoise pounds, and the reverse. The second is to find the quantity and weight of water that would fill an upright pipe of any given diameter and height: and consequently, to know what power would be required to work a common pump, or any other hydraulic engine, when the diameter of the bore of the pump, and the height to which the water is to be raised, are given; proper allowance being made for friction. These two cases are as follows.\n\nVol. LV. K Troy\nTroy weight compared with avoirdupoise weight.\n\nOne troy pound contains 5760 grains; and\nOne avoirdupoise pound contains 7000 grains.\n\nTherefore,\n175 troy pounds are equal to 144 avoird. pounds; and\n175 troy ounces are equal to 192 avoird. ounces.\n\nOn these principles, the two following Tables are constructed.\n\n1.

And so\nmuch would be required to balance this quantity of\nwater in a pump, or any other hydraulic engine,\nand as much more to raise it as would be sufficient\nto overcome the friction of the engine.\n\nThe reason for removing the decimal points one\nplace forward for tens, two places for hundreds, &c.,\nis evident: for, when any number consists of integer\nand decimal figures, the setting of the decimal point\none place forward is the same thing as multiplying\nthe number by 10; two places forward, the same\nas multiplying the number by 100; and so on: as\nthe tables themselves are calculated only from\n1 to 9.\n1 to 9. But 1 multiplied by 10 produces 10, and 9 multiplied by 10 produces 90. And so on for all the intermediate units.\n\nX. A Recommendation of Hadley's Quadrant for surveying, especially the surveying of Harbours, together with a particular Application of it in some Cases of Pilotage. By the Rev. John Michell, B.D. F.R.S.\n\nRead Feb. 14, 1765.\n\nTHE use of Hadley's quadrant, as an instrument to take altitudes at sea, is already so well established, that it wants no farther recommendation; but there are several other purposes, to which it may be applied, with great advantage, which, though obvious enough, seem yet to be hardly sufficiently attended to. There is no instrument so well adapted to many kinds of surveying, either for exactness or conveniency, and particularly the last; but the surveying of harbours, or such sands, as lie within sight of land, may often-times be performed by it, not only with vastly more ease, but also with a much greater degree of precision, than can be hoped for by any other means, as it is the only instrument in use, in which neither the exactness of the observations, nor the ease with which they may be taken, are sensibly affected by the motion of a vessel: and hence a single observer, in a boat, may generally determine the situation of any place he",
