By Henry Nelson, M.D.\nCommunicated by Allen Thomson, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Anatomy in the University of Glasgow.\n\nReceived May 22,—Read June 5, 1851.\n\nHAVING been led to investigate the mode of generation and development of the *Ascaris mystax*, I venture to lay before the Royal Society the results of my observations, in the hope that they may not be devoid of interest.\n\nThe worm in question has been long known to helminthologists (Plate XXV*. figs. 3 and 4); it varies from 1 to 3 inches in length, is fusiform, and covered with a striated horny cuticle, which is projected on either side of the head to form the alae characteristic of the species (fig. 1 a).\n\nThe *Ascaris mystax* is found within the intestinal canal of the domestic Cat. So common is it, that out of about thirty examined for the purpose I have not failed to find them in more than three or four cases.\n\nThe part in which they are generally found in the greatest abundance is that portion of the duodenum between the pylorus and the opening of the bile-duct. When the cat has fasted for some hours, the Ascarides pass the pyloric valve into the stomach, apparently in search of food; but this is never the case during digestion; on the contrary, they appear to be then swept further down the intestinal canal than the part they normally occupy.\n\nThe male *Ascaris mystax* (fig. 3) is about an inch and a quarter in length; while the female (fig. 4) is from 2 to 3 inches, and occasionally even 4 inches.\n\nThe males are easily distinguishable by their size and the peculiar curve of their tails (fig. 3 a), which are coiled round on the ventral aspect, while those of the females increase slightly in thickness to within a short distance of their termination, and are perfectly straight without any curvature of the point (fig. 4 a).\n\nThis creature derives its specific name from two lateral projections on either side of the head resembling moustaches (fig. 1 a). These projections or alae are flat, transparent and striated, being covered by the horny cuticle which envelopes the whole body (fig. 1 d). In front is the mouth with its three lobes (fig. 1 b) opening directly into the intestinal canal (fig. 1 c). The entire body is covered with cartilaginous rings placed side by side and exactly of the same breadth, the whole forming one continuous cuticular envelope, appearing to be regularly striated when viewed externally (fig. 1 d).\n\nMDCCCLII.\nThe posterior extremity of the female becomes suddenly narrowed to a blunt point (fig. 4 a), a short distance from which is the anal aperture.\n\nThe tail of the male, as I have said, is abruptly curved on itself (fig. 3 a), so that its dorsum is convex (fig. 5 a) and its ventral aspect concave (fig. 5 b). A short distance from the conical apex and on the ventral surface (fig. 2 b) is the anus (figs. 2 and 5 c), and a little in front of this is the genital orifice (figs. 2 and 5 d).\n\nOn either side of the concave surface (fig. 2 b) in the male is a projecting ridge (fig. 2 f'), consisting of a number of conical tubercles placed in a row and supporting a horny membrane that stretches between them. This membrane is finely serrated; the teeth look towards the tail, and no doubt serve an important part in giving it a secure hold while embracing the body of the female.\n\nThe intestinal canal is a straight tube (figs. 1 c and 5 i) passing from the mouth to the anus, situated in the axis of the body and surrounded by loose cellular tissue. It usually contains undigested particles and portions of intestinal villi of the Cat.\n\nAfter this general description, I pass to the consideration of the reproductive organs, and commence with the generative apparatus of the male as being the more simple.\n\nBy squeezing the tail carefully between plates of glass two spicula (fig. 2 g) are forced out of the genital orifice (fig. 2 d), already mentioned. These spicula are slightly curved, the curvature looking towards the body, and in the ordinary state of the parts are entirely retracted within the trunk. They are placed one before the other, they are about \\(\\frac{1}{26}\\)th of an inch in length and \\(\\frac{1}{1800}\\)dth in breadth; their consistence is horny, their structure tubular with a joint at the base (fig. 6 f'), which allows of the spiculum being withdrawn (fig. 5 g). That part beyond the joint (fig. 6 c, f') which always remains within the body even when the spiculum is protruded, is cartilaginous in appearance, and is furnished with tooth-like projections for the attachment of the muscles engaged in its protrusion and retraction, fig. 6 d. Near the apex is an aperture (fig. 7 b) by which the seminal fluid escapes, when forced along the tubular spiculum (figs. 6 and 7 a).\n\nOf the way in which copulation takes place I can speak with certainty, having in my possession a specimen in which the tail of the male is wound round so as to embrace that portion of the trunk of the female where the orifice of the vagina (Plate XXX. fig. 91 a) is situated, by which means the spicula are directed into its cavity.\n\nThe internal organs of generation in the male consist of a single tube variously contracted and dilated, but without any branching or division (Plate XXV*. fig. 5 h, k, m, n, o). This tube is placed between the integument and the intestinal canal (fig. 5 i) and originates in a very fine caecal extremity (fig. 5 o). As it gradually enlarges it becomes much contorted, doubled backwards and forwards, surrounding the intestinal canal and occupying the posterior half of the body.\n\nCommencing at the narrow extremity (fig. 5 o) is a very long tubular portion (fig. 5 o, m) that answers to the testicle; joined to this is the seminal vesicle (fig. 5 k),\nwhich is dilated, and several times the diameter of the testicular tube. Lastly, the seminal vesicle contracts slightly and forms the sheath of the spicula (fig. 5 h). The membrane forming the caecal extremity (fig. 8 a) is very thick but soon becomes thin, so that the upper portion of the testicle (fig. 5 o) is perfectly transparent, and at the same time homogeneous (fig. 8 b). On examining the membranous walls of the generative tube lower down, they first present a granular appearance (fig. 9 b), and then longitudinal striæ along with the finely granular structure (fig. 10 b). A little above the seminal vesicle (fig. 5 k) the tube becomes muscular, presenting transverse rugæ (fig. 11), intended no doubt to force forward the contents. This muscular portion, which may be called the vas deferens (fig. 5 m), connects the testicle (fig. 5 o, n) with the seminal vesicle (fig. 5 k), and from its contractility remains constantly empty and therefore transparent. The vesicle itself (fig. 5 k) is covered by reticulations of long muscular fibrillæ, giving it the appearance of being enclosed in a net. When these fibres contract, the contained semen must be expelled with considerable power. The spicula also are provided with special muscles for protrusion and retraction, but into the particulars of these I shall not enter, passing to the far more important investigation of the mode in which the seminal particles are developed.\n\nI have already described the apex of the caecal extremity (fig. 8 a) as composed of a very thick membrane, but this membrane, although perfectly well defined on the exterior is not so within. Externally homogeneous, it becomes internally more and more granular till its inner surface appears almost entirely composed of very minute granules (fig. 8 c).\n\nThis is the true secreting organ, for the granules when thrown off begin immediately to swell and form nucleated cells (figs. 8 and 9 d). The homogeneous portion of the testicle is filled with little else than these cells of various sizes, floating in a transparent fluid (fig. 8), but as it becomes gradually striated, the cells are obscured by an immense number of minute opake granules (fig. 9 a).\n\nThe nucleated cells (fig. 9 d) and granules (fig. 9 a) are at first intermixed without any order, but further down the granules group themselves round the cells (fig. 9 f'), forming envelopes for each individually (fig. 10 a). On rupturing the testicular tube at its commencement, the nucleated cells (Plate XXVI. fig. 18 a) are protruded, floating in a granular fluid (fig. 18 b); they have a very transparent cell-wall and a nucleus attached to one side (fig. 18 d). About the middle we find the granular masses (fig. 19 a) irregular in form, but within which the nucleated spermatic cells (fig. 19 b) may be distinctly seen. The masses are however so delicate that the slightest pressure destroys them altogether (fig. 19 c). Passing as far down as the muscular portion of the testicular tube, the vas deferens (Plate XXV*. fig. 5 m), we find the masses much smaller in size as well as more regular in shape (Plate XXVI. fig. 20 a). The granular envelope is globular with a well-defined margin and perfectly opake, so as to render invisible the included cell except when ruptured by\npressure (fig. 20 b). This (fig. 20 a) is the utmost development the semen undergoes, as long as it remains in the male organs. These granular envelopes (fig. 20 a) appear to perform the important function of preserving and preventing the enlargement of the spermatic cells contained within them (fig. 20 c), for sometimes, but very rarely, a spermatic cell may be seen, which having escaped from its granular covering, has swollen up to three times its former size (fig. 20 d), an occurrence which, if it happened more frequently, would prevent their passage through the spiculae, whose calibre is only capable of admitting a single granular mass at a time.\n\nAlthough the further changes which the spermatic cells undergo take place within the female, and consequently totally unconnected with the generative apparatus of the male, for the sake of continuity and to prevent confusion, I shall treat of them here.\n\nOn examining the uterine contents of a recently impregnated *Ascaris mystax*, a granular fluid is observed in which a number of nucleated cells are floating, but I have never been able to observe the granular masses already described as seen in the male. The disappearance then of the granular envelope (fig. 20 a, b) is the first visible change in the constitution of the semen, and can be accounted for in many ways.\n\nThe loose granules are the debris of the cell cases; while the nucleated cells (Plate XXVI. figs. 21–36) are simply the spermatic cells (fig. 20 c) much enlarged, apparently by the spontaneous imbibition of the surrounding fluid. By this enlargement, a most beautifully transparent spherical cell (figs. 21, 22 a) is produced \\( \\frac{1}{900} \\)th of an inch in diameter, enclosing, or rather having attached to its inner surface a round, discoidal nucleus (fig. 21 b), and within this a nucleolus (fig. 21 c), sometimes even two nucleoli.\n\nBefore I describe, however, the transformation of these nuclei into spermatic particles, it will be useful to examine cursorily the statements of others on the subject.\n\n**Wagner** and **Leuckardt**, in their article on Semen, in **Todd's Cyclopædia**, speaking of the *Ascaris acuminata*, say, \"the nucleus has at first a roundish shape (fig. 12 a), but gradually stretches itself more and more, and projects more or less outwards with its point (figs. 13, 14, 15 a); thus metamorphosing itself into the peduncle-like appendix of the spermatozoon, the body of which is formed from the persisting membrane of the seminal cell\" (figs. 12 to 15 b).\n\n**Kolliker** states that these cells (fig. 16 a) are formed four at a time within other larger cells (fig. 16 b); and that the elongated nuclei of **Siebold** and **Wagner** (figs. 14, 15 a) are mere bundles of undeveloped spermatozoa, whose form he supposes, but has never seen, to be capillary.\n\n**Reichert**, in his researches on the development of the spermatozoa of the *Ascaris acuminata*, indicates a spermatic cell containing a nucleus and nucleolus (fig. 17). The cell increases in size (fig. 17 a), as does the nucleolus (fig. 17 c); but the nucleus becomes less definite, and retains its former size (fig. 17 b).\nThis, then, according to him, is the fully-formed spermatozoon, consisting of a spherical cell (fig. 17 a), a nucleolus (fig. 17 c), and indistinct nucleus (fig. 17 b).\n\nThis is the substance of previous investigations respecting the development of the spermatic particles. I now proceed to state my observations as to their formation in the *Ascaris mystax*, the phenomena of which will be found to differ materially from those just described.\n\nI have previously stated, that in the more developed condition of the spermatic cells they appear as transparent vesicles, without any granular envelope (figs. 21, 22 a), but containing a nucleus (figs. 21, 22 b) and nucleolus (figs. 21, 22 c). The nucleus appears discoidal when seen from above (fig. 21 b), but lenticular when viewed in profile (fig. 22 b), apparently enclosed between two portions of the membranous cell-wall (figs. 22 a and d). The internal margin of the nucleus (fig. 22 d) soon loses its clear and defined outline (fig. 23 b); the granular mass constituting the nucleus undergoes a marked increase in volume, projecting in a more or less conical form towards the centre of the cell (figs. 23–28 b). A membrane is then formed over the whole of that part of the nucleus which is in contact with the wall of the spermatic cell (figs. 23, 24, f'). This membrane is very distinctly seen to separate the granular matter of the nucleus from the external cell, with which it is in accurate contact. It is also an entirely new formation not to be found in any of the former stages, and is apparently produced at the expense of the most external granules of the nucleus. The margin, however, of this discoidal membrane (figs. 23, 28 f') is not in apposition with the cell-wall, but has a tendency to surround and enclose the nucleus; giving the membrane the form of a watch-glass, whose convexity is in contact with the spermatic cell, while in its concavity are contained the granules of the nucleus, of which it forms a part. The watch-glass form, however, is soon lost, the membrane acquiring a tendency to become more convex at its centre, assumes first the appearance of a cup, filled to overflowing with the granular substance (fig. 31 f'), then that of a rounded cone whose margin is everted or bell-shaped (fig. 32 f'); though this is sometimes not to be seen from the nuclear matter which surrounds and hides it from view (fig. 33 f').\n\nWhen this convexity takes place exactly in the middle, the external cell-wall is projected in the form of a papilla (figs. 24 to 27 a), but this is probably only an accidental occurrence, and not the general rule.\n\nAlthough at variance with the statements of Wagner, I say this with the more confidence, as Dr. Allen Thomson, with whom I had an opportunity of examining these changes, most fully coincides in the view I have here taken. A slight projection of the external cell-wall is indeed common at one period; but in no instance have I observed a greater amount of protrusion than that figured in (fig. 27 a). The elongation of the nucleus into a tail must be regarded as doubtful in the *Ascaris acuminata*, as it is certainly not the case in the *Ascaris mystax*.\nHow then is the spermatic particle formed? I have described the tendency of the nuclear membrane to become more and more convex; as this convexity increases the apex impinges more or less obliquely against the cell-wall (figs. 28, 32, 33a), protruding it slightly at the same time that it is itself diverted from the straight course, becoming bent into a curved form (figs. 29, 30f). By this time the granular portion of the nucleus has become much diminished in volume, still presenting, however, the nucleolus (fig. 34c); while the nuclear membrane has passed from the conical to a cylindrical shape (fig. 34f). During these changes in form, the nuclear membrane likewise increases in thickness, and presents a double outline (figs. 29 to 34f), and refracts light strongly.\n\nBy contraction in its transverse diameter and elongation in the other, it gradually assumes the form of a test-tube (figs. 35, 36f), bent, however, to adapt itself to the concavity of the spermatic cell (figs. 35, 36a), often making a curve of a quarter of a circle.\n\nFrom the period at which a double outline is first visible, the granules begin to disappear (figs. 29, 30b), till at last the nucleus (fig. 22b) becomes entirely transformed into an elongated caecal tube (figs. 35, 36f) with very thick sides, the cavity being occupied by a dark homogeneous substance, while at its mouth is found the nucleolus (figs. 35, 36c) and a few granules that have not yet disappeared (figs. 35, 36b); the whole, however, still enclosed within the spherical spermatic cell (figs. 35, 36a).\n\nThe blind extremity next enlarges slightly, while the enveloping cell dissolves, and a flask-shaped body, the true spermatic particle, is thus set free (fig. 38).\n\nAlthough the disappearance of the spermatic cell occurs normally at this period, it often happens much sooner, and thus we find the spermatic particles set free in all stages of their development, from the primitive nucleus (fig. 37b) to the perfect condition (fig. 38).\n\nIn many of these spermatic particles the nucleolus (figs. 37, 38c) still remains; but it also in course of time disappears, leaving the mouths of these hollow bodies apparently open (fig. 38g).\n\nOriginally the nucleated cells (fig. 18a) in the caecal extremity of the testicle (fig. 8) are not more than $\\frac{1}{10000}$th of an inch in diameter; as they descend they become enveloped by granules, at first forming irregular masses about $\\frac{1}{1000}$th of an inch (fig. 19), but by gradual consolidation become the round, opake bodies which I have called granular masses (fig. 20a), measuring $\\frac{1}{1700}$th of an inch in diameter, and containing each a single spermatic cell, now, however, increased to $\\frac{1}{2500}$th of an inch (fig. 20c).\n\nAfter the spermatic cells are introduced into the female uterus they enlarge rapidly, and are met with measuring from $\\frac{1}{1000}$th to $\\frac{1}{700}$th of an inch (figs. 21 to 36). The nucleus is about one third the diameter of the cell, or about $\\frac{1}{2700}$th\nof an inch (figs. 21 to 26 b); while the breadth of the spermatic particles varies from $\\frac{1}{5000}$th to $\\frac{1}{3600}$th of an inch, and their length from $\\frac{1}{1600}$th to $\\frac{1}{700}$th of an inch (figs. 37, 38 f, g).\n\nThe spermatic particles (figs 37, 38) have long been known, but their nature has not hitherto been fully determined.\n\nCloquet, in his elaborate work on the *Ascaris lumbricoides*, mistook them for undeveloped ova. More lately, Kolliker imagined them to be bundles of capillary spermatic filaments.\n\nWagner believes them to form the tail only of the spermatozoon (figs. 14, 15 a); while Reichert evidently did not recognise their function, as he makes a nucleated cell (fig. 17) his \"Reifes Saamen Körperchen.\"\n\nLastly, Siebold conjectures these corpuscles to be spermatozoa, having seen them in contact with the ova, but appears to have gone no further into the investigation.\n\nThat these flask-shaped bodies (fig. 38) are the mature spermatic particles cannot now be doubted, as we meet with them the highest in the oviduct of the female, while near the external orifice of the vagina none but nucleated cells, or cup-shaped nuclei only are seen.\n\nAs already stated, I have never observed a spermatic particle forcing out the cell-wall, except at a very early period of its development (figs. 24 to 29); but when perfectly formed, it is set free by the total disappearance of the spermatic cell. Nothing then remains except a few granules surrounding the nucleolus (fig. 38 b, c); and, although the cell-wall is very frequently lost much earlier, the development of the nuclear membrane, which constitutes the spermatic particle, seems to go on as long as any granules remain to be transformed. Wagner, therefore, is not correct in supposing these bodies to be mere tails, because they never project as such from the spermatic cells; also, when they become free, it is by the total disappearance of the cell; and lastly, because they alone are found highest in the oviduct.\n\nAgain, speaking relatively, what immense spermatozoa these cells (figs. 21 to 36) would make, if the opinions of Wagner and Reichert were correct, from $\\frac{1}{1000}$th to $\\frac{1}{700}$th of an inch in diameter, or one third that of the ovum in the same animal! a circumstance altogether unparalleled.\n\nNeither do I see any reason to believe Kolliker's statement, that the spermatic cells are formed four at a time, within a mother-cell (fig. 16), never having observed such an occurrence.\n\nThe whole of the changes I have described may easily be traced by examining the uteri of the larger individuals, as in these impregnation has in all probability not occurred till very lately; their size apparently depending on the non-evolution of fertile ova.\n\nHowever, from the delicacy and transparent nature of the spermatic cell, when at its greatest development, the very best microscopes must be employed in order to detect it.\nHaving now fully traced the formation of the spermatic particles, from the nucleated granule, thrown off by the caecal extremity of the testicular tube (Plate XXV*. fig. 8 d) to the flask-shaped body met with in the oviduct (Plate XXVI. fig. 38), I now pass to the description of the female organism, previous to entering on the development of the ovum.\n\nThe female *Ascaris*, as I have already said (Plate XXV*. fig. 4), is larger than the male (fig. 3); its tail also is straight (fig. 4 a) and not curled up (fig. 3 a).\n\nThe orifice of the vagina (Plate XXX. fig. 91 a) is placed about one third the length of the animal from the head; it is a simple circular opening, but so small as to be seen with the greatest difficulty. The ovarian tubes, on the other hand, may be seen filling the body with convolutions, reaching from the tail to within a short distance of the head.\n\nThe reproductive apparatus is not firmly fixed in one position, but moves backwards and forwards with considerable facility in the space between the intestinal tube and integument.\n\nThe following is the method I employed for the extraction of these generative tubes. Cut off the head and neck a little above the convolutions, and seizing the tail with forceps, by very gradually increased pressure, commencing at the tail and passed along the body towards the cut extremity, squeeze out the whole visceral contents, leaving nothing but skin behind.\n\nTo prevent entanglement of the different parts it is best to effect this expression under water. When it has been accomplished, with needles unravel the convolutions and remove the intestinal canal, which is easily recognised by its straightness and great relative diameter. If carefully performed, we obtain two very long, almost capillary tubes (fig. 92 a, b, c, d), which after enlarging (fig. 92 f) become united into one canal (fig. 92 g), whose termination has already been described as the generative orifice (fig. 91 a).\n\nOn examining the reproductive apparatus (fig. 92) we observe it to be composed of several portions, differing in appearance as well as structure.\n\nThese tubes commence near the tail in two extremely delicate caecal ends (fig. 92 a), gradually increase in size as well as in opacity, and after performing various convolutions backwards and forwards throughout the greater part of the body (fig. 92 b) they suddenly become constricted (fig. 92 c). This opake portion is the ovary, or rather the ovarian tube, and is from 4 to 6 inches in length; it is followed by an almost transparent piece from a quarter to half an inch in length, with a constriction at either end, separating it from the ovary on the one side and the part that immediately succeeds on the other (fig. 92 c, d). Each tube now becomes greatly dilated, so as to be several times the diameter of the former portions, forming what are termed the uteri (fig. 92 f).\n\nThe uteri are also half an inch long, lie parallel to each other, and unite together to form a vagina of about the same length (fig. 92 g). The opacity of the ovaries, uteri,\nand vagina (fig. 92 a, b, f, g) is dependent on the eggs with which they are distended, while the transparent portion (fig. 92 c, d) contains hardly any (fig. 90 c, d).\n\nThis part has not received any definite name, nor have its limits been pointed out; but as it is here that the important process of fecundation takes place a name becomes indispensably necessary. To this, therefore, I shall apply the name of Oviduct (figs. 90 and 92 c, d).\n\nThe upper extremity of the ovary is formed of a membranous and perfectly transparent tube (Plate XXVII. fig. 39 h), much thicker at the very end (fig. 39 a). It is from this thick portion (fig. 39 a), which presents a finely granular structure, that the germinal vesicles are thrown off; it constitutes therefore the true ovary.\n\nA short distance from the extremity, one or more apparent invaginations occur (fig. 39 b, b), as if other caecal tubes were contained within the first; but these appearances are probably caused by casts of the internal surface of the upper end of the ovary (fig. 39 a), which are probably thrown off at intervals.\n\nOn examining a portion of the ovarian tube where it begins to be opake (fig. 40 h), we observe it marked with very faint lines and minute granules; but as we descend they gradually increase in distinctness. The sides also become thicker, so that about midway the tube is formed of a homogeneous membrane externally (fig. 41 h), continuous with that forming the caecal extremity (fig. 39 h), and a number of longitudinal ridges or striæ internally (fig. 41 l). Each of these longitudinal striæ (fig. 41 l) contains a number of granules imbedded in them, causing them to project into the interior of the tube, and giving it somewhat the appearance of a rifle barrel (fig. 41 k).\n\nThis is the structure presented by the ovarian tube for the greater part of its length (fig. 41), commencing as soon as granules are seen to surround the germinal vesicles (fig. 40 k), and becoming gradually more distinct to within a short distance of the oviduct, where the striæ disappear and the external membrane alone remains (fig. 42 h).\n\nThe spot where the ovary terminates and the oviduct (fig. 42 m) begins is marked, as already stated, by a constriction (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c), causing such an amount of narrowing in the calibre of the generative tube (Plate XXVII. fig. 42 m) as only to admit the passage of one ovule at a time (fig. 42 o). The whole length of the oviduct (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c, d) is characterized by transverse markings, evidently of a muscular or contractile nature, and most developed at the ends where the constrictions (Plate XXVII. fig. 42 m) occur. While the exterior of the oviduct is transversely ribbed (fig. 42 n), its interior is lined with large cells, distended with a dark granular fluid, projecting into the cavity of the tube, and having all the appearance of secreting cells.\n\nThat these cells do secrete some sort of fluid, is proved by the fact that they become turgid when the Ascaris has been feeding, and are, on the contrary, almost invisible from flaccidity when it has had no food.\n\nWhile the ovary is filled with an almost solid mass of ovules (Plate XXX. fig. 90 b),\nthe oviduct (fig. 90 c, d) contains a transparent, finely-granular fluid with only an ovule here and there. It is therefore probable that a peristaltic action being set up by the transverse muscular fibres of the oviduct, the ovules are detached and forced forwards singly into the uterus (fig. 90 f'). Another constriction (fig. 90 d), but not so well marked as the first (fig. 90 c), indicates the termination of the oviduct, beyond which the tube becomes suddenly dilated into the uterus (fig. 90 f'), which is several times the diameter of the preceding portions.\n\nThe uterus commences by a rounded extremity or fundus (fig. 90 f'), into which the oviduct (fig. 90 c, d) opens, and gradually becomes narrower until it unites with its fellow (fig. 92 f') to form one tapering vagina (fig. 92 g). The uteri are formed of an external membrane (Plate XXVII. fig. 43 h) lined with broad, flat, quadrangular cells (fig. 43 r), each of which presents an oval or round nucleus (fig. 43 s) and a central nucleolus (fig. 43 t), of great beauty and distinctness.\n\nLastly, the vagina presents some transverse muscular rugae externally, with nucleated flat cells internally, completing thus the complex structure of the female reproductive apparatus.\n\nThe caecal extremity of the ovary (fig. 39 a) throws off, as I have said, small rounded granules (fig. 39 c), which enlarge rapidly and form the germinal vesicles (fig. 39 d).\n\nThese granules are formed by the thickened apex, and give its substance a semi-transparent structure (fig. 39 a). A fluid likewise fills the upper part of the ovarian tube, of an albuminous nature, and apparently the secretion of its walls. The germinal particles or granules when first thrown off, by the internal surface of the caecal apex, are only $\\frac{1}{10,000}$th of an inch in size (fig. 39 c), but begin almost immediately to increase to several times their original bulk, become vesicular (fig. 39 d), and present a nucleus within each cell (fig. 39 f'). These are the germinal vesicles, and their included nuclei are the germinal spots (fig. 39 d, f').\n\nKolliker describes the invaginated appearance of the upper end of the ovary (fig. 39 b) as large cells whose nuclei are the germinal spots, which are set free by the successive openings of these large cells. (See Müller's Archiv for 1843.)\n\nHe further states that the germinal spot is first formed, and around it the germinal vesicle is developed like a primitive cell round its nucleus. My observations, however, lead me to believe that a germinal particle is first formed (fig. 39 c), which appears semiopake and solid (fig. 44 + ); and that by the imbibition of the surrounding fluid the external membrane or layer of this germinal particle is distended, and thus forms the germinal vesicle (fig. 44 b), leaving the solid contents to form a central nucleus or germinal spot (fig. 44 a).\n\nThe germinal vesicles (fig. 39 d) are now $\\frac{1}{3500}$th of an inch in size; as they pass down the ovary they disappear (fig. 40 k), becoming enveloped by opake granules (fig. 39 g).\n\nAt first, that is to say in the upper part of the ovarian tubes, these granules (fig. 39 g) are perfectly free, floating loosely in the fluid that surrounds them and lying in con-\ntact, though not adherent to the germinal vesicles (figs. 39, 40 d). A little further down we observe the whole contents of the tubes to become gelatinous, and to consist apparently of nothing but granules. On applying gentle pressure so as to rupture this portion of the tube, the granular contents are easily forced out and may be seen to break up into semitransparent masses (figs. 45, 46).\n\nEach mass (figs. 45, 46 d) constitutes an ovule, small and imperfect, but containing all the parts essential to an ovule. In the centre of each is a germinal vesicle (figs. 45, 46 b) enclosing a germinal spot (figs. 45, 46 a), and surrounded by opake granules (figs. 45, 46 c) imbedded in a transparent jelly-like substance.\n\nThese granules (figs. 45, 46 c) are of a fatty nature, and constitute the yolk in its primitive condition.\n\nThe ovule in this stage of its development is very irregular in form (figs. 45, 46), sometimes caudate, sometimes triangular, and at others round. They are all flattened and transparent, so that the contained germinal vesicle and spot may be distinctly recognised (figs. 45, 46 a, b) when viewed separately.\n\nThe distinctness of the outline which the transparent substance of the ovule presents (figs. 45, 46 d), led me at first to suppose that it was caused by a delicate enveloping membrane; but from further research I am led to believe that no such membrane exists, but that the distinct and regular outline is owing to the solidity and high refractive power of the clear substance (figs. 45, 46 d).\n\nWhen the ovule is of a caudate or triangular form (fig. 45 d), the clear substance does not present so distinct an outline at the apex as elsewhere. From its being invariably placed nearest the centre of the ovarian tube it is probably the last formed, and therefore less consolidated than the other parts. It is doubtful whence the vitelline granules are formed (figs. 45, 46 c); they may be either thrown off by the caecal extremity along with the germinal particles, separate spontaneously from the surrounding fluid, or be formed by the striated walls of the ovary.\n\nI believe that the large granules (fig. 39 g), first seen to surround the germinal vesicles, are thrown off by the blind extremity, and become attached to them by the coagulation, or rather the consolidation of the surrounding albuminous fluid (figs. 45, 46). But when the ovule arrives at the striated portion (fig. 41) the number of yolk-granules is greatly increased (Plate XXVIII. figs. 48, 51 c), leading to the supposition that the granules contained within the striae (Plate XXVII. fig. 41 k) are thrown off, and become imbedded in the clear substance of the ovule (Plate XXVIII. figs. 48, 51 d).\n\nThe possibility of such an occurrence cannot be doubted, both from the absence of a distinct limiting membrane round the ovule, as well as from the gelatinous nature of the clear substance, having a tendency to entangle and detain anything that may come in contact with it.\n\nThe germinal vesicles maintain exactly the same appearance, but increase a little in size (fig. 48 b), become globular in shape, and contain a highly refractive fluid\nwhich makes them easily distinguishable. But while the germinal vesicle enlarges so slightly, the ovule increases rapidly as it descends the ovarian tube, passing from $\\frac{1}{1000}$th to $\\frac{1}{250}$th of an inch in diameter. This increase is not only owing to the granules which appear to be accumulated from the walls of the ovary, but also to an increase in the amount of the clear substance.\n\nSome have supposed the increase in the number of the granules to be owing to their spontaneous division, while others have thought that they are formed by the germinal vesicle. To the first theory it may be objected, that the granules remain very much of the same size throughout, while those contained in the same ovule correspond exactly, which would not be the case if each granule were dividing into two or more. That the granules are not produced by the germinal vesicle is evident from its remaining very much of the same size and perfectly entire.\n\nOn the other hand, the reasons for supposing them to be formed from the walls of the ovary are, that the granules become more and more numerous as the ovule passes down the tube. Secondly, that the granules (Plate XXVIII. figs. 48, 51 c) exactly resemble in size, colour and form, those produced by the internal surface of the ovary (Plate XXVII. fig. 41 k). Lastly, because the striæ (fig. 41 l) of the ovary cease just where the ovule ceases to become larger (fig. 42 h).\n\nThe fact that the ovula were packed edgewise in this part of the tube (Plate XXVIII. fig. 49 c) was pointed out to me by Dr. Allen Thomson; also that three or four occupied the same plane (fig. 50 d). Hence the necessity of the ovula assuming the triangular form (Plate XXVII. fig. 47); the only form met with as long as the ovula present the appearance of a dense opake mass (Plate XXVIII. fig. 49).\n\nThe ovary is about $\\frac{1}{120}$th of an inch broad at its widest part; and here it is that we find the ovula packed generally four on a plane (fig. 50 d), with their edges presenting externally (fig. 49 d), appearing long and narrow when viewed in profile (fig. 49 c), but broad and triangular when seen in front (fig. 49 b), entirely filling the transverse section of the tube (fig. 50 w).\n\nAs the granules increase in number so the clear substance becomes more and more obscured, till at length the whole ovule appears to be composed entirely of vitelline granules. The germinal vesicle (fig. 48 b) can no longer be distinguished, the ovule being perfectly opake (fig. 50 d). In this state they are met with near the entrance of the oviduct (fig. 50 d); they now become separated, detached singly from the mass, lose their triangular form (fig. 51), and by passing through the first constriction (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c) enter the glandular portion of the reproductive apparatus (Plate XXVII. fig. 42 n; Plate XXX. fig. 90 c, d).\n\nWhen impregnation has taken place, the ovule first meets with the spermatic particles (Plate XXVII. fig. 42 p) in this part of the oviduct (fig. 42 n), but I think it may be best to trace the further changes it undergoes in the unimpregnated state, as they enable us to explain, or what is of more consequence, to contrast the appearances presented by the fecundated ovum with those of the non-vivified egg.\nAs soon as the ovule enters the glandular portion (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c, d) it floats free in a clear fluid secreted by the cells lining the oviduct. The ovule becomes thicker and more rounded, losing the flattened form it assumes that of an oblong sphere (Plate XXVIII. fig. 52). A granular chorion (fig. 54 f') begins to form, surrounding the ovule and constituting an elastic shell (fig. 55 f'). While this external chorion is forming, however, the internal contents are undergoing change, the vitelline granules become much smaller in size (fig. 52 c), the germinal vesicle and spot disappear, and in their place we find a number of large transparent globules (fig. 53 e), having much more the appearance of oil than of being formed by cells. These globules are apparently formed partly by the disappearance of the germinal vesicle, and partly by the separation of the oil from the granules of the vitellus. After a time these oily globules (fig. 54 e) approach the circumference and disappear (fig. 55 e), while the minute opake particles (figs. 54, 55 c) pass towards the centre. The ovule now begins to shrink, the chorion becomes more granular and thicker (fig. 56 f'), while from its inner surface a delicate membrane separates (fig. 57 o), and contracting on the particles contained within it, forms one molecular mass, spherical and perfectly opake (fig. 56 o).\n\nThis false ovum (fig. 56), if I may be allowed to call it so, is surrounded externally by a peculiar granulated chorion or shell of an irregularly ovoid form (fig. 56 f'), within which, but separated from it by a clear fluid, is the opake spherical mass already described, with its delicate membrane (fig. 56 o). On rupturing one of these false ova, the opake mass is found (fig. 57 c) to consist of granules and a few oil-globules. While the fertile egg does not remain stationary but advances, stage after stage, till the worm is produced, the false ovum undergoes no further development, but when expelled from the vagina of the *Ascaris* rapidly decays.\n\nIn all those instances in which the spermatic fluid was imperfectly developed, or had not ascended higher than the uterus, false ova alone existed (fig. 56), having all the characters of those just described, and incapable of further change.\n\nFrom this we may infer, that after the formation of the chorion (figs. 54 to 56 f') impregnation of the ovule is impossible; and as the chorion is formed while the egg is yet within the oviduct (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c, d), fertilization must take place, if at all, while the ovule is still in the oviduct, and before the formation of that envelope.\n\nLet us now return to the fertile condition of the female, and trace the development of the ovum as it threads the oviduct (fig. 90 c, d).\n\nThe ovula are here surrounded by the spermatic particles; here it is that fecundation takes place,—by which alone fertile ova can be produced.\n\nThis conversion of the ovule into the fertile ovum, I shall endeavour to describe according to my own repeated observations.\n\nImmediately that the ovule passes the constriction which terminates the ovary and enters the oviduct (Plate XXVII. fig. 42 n), it comes in contact with the semen (fig. 42 p), and a marked change in its form and appearance takes place. It is at this\nperiod of an oblong shape (Plate XXVIII. fig. 58), and appears to be entirely made up of distinct opake granules, which completely hide the germinal vesicle and spot (figs. 58 to 60 c).\n\nThe edge at first is uniform, that is to say, not ragged, but presents a distinct outline (fig. 58 d). Sometimes a faint trace of the germinal vesicle may be perceived (fig. 60 b), although the ovule is never so transparent as to allow objects on the other side to be seen through it.\n\nIn the upper portion of the oviduct (Plate XXVII. fig. 42 n) we find the spermatic particles (fig. 42 p) in their greatest perfection (Plate XXVI. fig. 38 g), presenting the flask-like appearance, and in such numbers as to fill all the interstices between the ovulum and the sides of the oviduct.\n\nAt first the margin of the ovule (Plate XXVIII. fig. 51 d) is entire, that is to say, the clear substance presents a distinct, even and continuous surface, but a little further we perceive the spermatic particles to be closely applied against the ovule, depressing its surface in some places (fig. 60 g). Another step in advance, and all the ovula present an irregular rupture in some part or other of their periphery (figs. 58 to 60), generally at one side (fig. 58), and frequently in several places at the same time (figs. 59, 60).\n\nDr. Allen Thomson, having frequently examined these appearances, permits me to say that he agrees entirely with the above description of the phenomena.\n\nThat these appearances do not arise from pressure applied during the examination I am perfectly satisfied, having repeated my observations above a hundred times, and varied them so as to remove all possibility of such an occurrence. The effect of pressure on the ovule is also very different from that just described, as I have repeatedly seen; for if an entire ovule be squeezed between glasses, the vitelline granules coalesce, the clear substance dilates, and at last the whole lapses into a yellowish fluid.\n\nFrom the immense number of ovula in which I have seen this partial rupture of the vitellus, and the want of success in my endeavours to cause a similar protrusion (figs. 58 to 60 c) of the yolk-granules by compression, I am irresistibly led to the conclusion that this is a vital phenomenon consequent on some natural cause, and not the result of accidental violence. Further, to make all certain, I divided the oviduct at both ends, washed away all loose ovules by a gentle stream of water, and then superimposed, as carefully as possible, a piece of the thinnest glass. No other pressure than the weight of the thin piece of glass was applied, yet every one of the ovules, as they slowly found their way out of the oviduct, presented in some part or another this rupture of the surface.\n\nThe reason why all the granules do not escape, arises from their being imbedded, not in a fluid, but in a sort of gelatinous substance, easily broken up, it is true, but sufficiently coherent to retain the granules in their places.\n\nTo what then are these appearances owing, and how are they produced? I have\nalready said that the spermatic particles become first applied to the periphery of the ovule (Plate XXVIII. fig. 60 g); and that a little later they are seen to indent the surface.\n\nStill lower we find the spermatic particles imbedded in the substance of the ovule to a greater or less degree, and surrounded by the vitelline granules that have been displaced (fig. 58 g). Sometimes only one is seen to be thus imbedded (fig. 58 g), but more commonly several spermatic particles are applied at the same place, with their closed ends directed in general towards the centre (figs. 59, 60 gg). Penetration then takes place, the particles passing into the substance of the ovule, amongst the vitelline granules, and surrounded by the clear substance (figs. 59, 60 h).\n\nI have seen the spermatic particles in all stages of penetration, from mere contact (fig. 60 g) to perfect involvement within the ovule (figs. 59, 60 h). In their course they appear to create very little displacement, passing readily in all directions amongst the granules; their transparency and high refractive power rendering them easily distinguishable when near the surface (figs. 59, 60 h).\n\nOf the possibility of penetration, no one who has ever seen an ovule of this Ascaris can have the slightest doubt, composed as it is of a clear gelatinous substance, without an enveloping membrane; while the very granules it encloses (fig. 51 c), there is great reason to believe, have at some period entered from without.\n\nWith regard to the probability, there is the breaking up of the surface of the ovule in certain places (figs. 58 to 60 c), rendering it still easier for the entrance of the spermatic particles.\n\nSecondly, the application and adhesion of the seminal particles to the broken edge (figs. 58 to 60 g).\n\nLastly, their having been seen (figs. 59, 60 h) within the ovule, imbedded in its substance, and surrounded on all sides by the vitelline granules.\n\nAs I have shown the possibility and even the probability, it remains only for me to prove the correctness of my observations.\n\nThat the spermatic particles seen by me (figs. 59, 60 h) might possibly have been external to the ovule, will naturally occur to every microscopic observer. But this doubt is manifestly unfounded, for many reasons.\n\nFirst. The particles (figs. 59, 60 h) could not have been lying upon the ovule, because vitelline granules were visible above them; that is to say, by distancing the object-glass from the object, the spermatic particles became indistinct, and a layer of granules came into focus, entirely covering the space they occupied.\n\nSecondly. They could not have been below, for the ovules are much too opake to be seen through.\n\nThirdly. The seminal particles observed were only in focus, when the margin of the ovule was in focus, and must therefore have been on the same plane. But, as the ovule is a more or less spherical body, the focus of its margin corresponds with\nthat of its centre; hence the particles already mentioned could only have existed in the substance of the ovule.\n\nAnother objection might be raised; admitting the particles to have been situated in the substance of the ovule, might they not have been oil-globules, like those seen in the unfecundated egg?\n\nThe reply to this is most satisfactory; for not only were the particles elongated and cylindrical (figs. 59, 60 h), but the one extremity was closed, and the other open; hence they could only have been the spermatic particles of the male.\n\nI cannot enter here upon the consideration of the changes which occur in the mammiferous ovum, but confine myself to a few remarks.\n\nDr. Martin Barry says, \"On one occasion, in an ovum of $5\\frac{1}{4}$ hours, I saw in the orifice of the membrane\" (the external membrane of the ovum) \"an object very much resembling a spermatozoon which had increased in size . . . I am not prepared to say that this was certainly a spermatozoon, but it seems proper to record the observation.\"\n\nNow, whether we believe Dr. Barry to have really seen the penetration of the spermatozoon into the mammiferous ovum, or whether we agree with Bischoff and most other distinguished authors, and deny the correctness of Dr. Barry's observation, as well as the possibility of any such occurrence, the present investigations appear to be the first in which the fact of the penetration of spermatozoa into the ovum has been distinctly seen and clearly established, in one of the most highly organized of the entozoa.\n\nThe accuracy of these observations is satisfactorily borne out, and will be more readily admitted, as we continue to trace the progress of the ovule, the changes of the spermatic particles, and the development of the ovum.\n\nThe accompanying drawings present these appearances as exactly as possible, being taken originally from actual specimens, by means of a camera lucida. In some we find the broken margin of small extent (figs. 58, 60 c); in others it embraces nearly one half of the circumference (fig. 59 c). Some give a faint indication of the contained germinal vesicle (fig. 60 b); but in most the granules are too opake to admit of its being seen at all (figs. 58, 59). Let us now pass to the examination of the changes which take place in the ovule subsequent to the penetration of the spermatic particles.\n\nThe ovule, it must be remembered, is still in the oviduct; the secretive portion of the system, and that in which the false ova receive an enveloping membrane (figs. 54 to 57 f'). Almost immediately therefore that the ovule has entered the oviduct, traces of a chorion, as a very delicate membrane, begin to appear (fig. 61 f'), covering at first those portions only of the surface that remain smooth and entire (figs. 61, 62 f'); but as we descend, enclosing by degrees the ruptures themselves, and surrounding thus the whole ovule in one continuous envelope (fig. 63 f'), with\nits germinal vesicle, vitelline granules, and the spermatic particles that have penetrated its substance (fig. 63 h). Having entered the vitellus in different directions, and to various depths, the spermatic particles (figs. 61, 62 g) lose their characteristic form, and swell into irregular masses (figs. 61 to 63 h), transparent, presenting a distinct outline, and highly refractive.\n\nThese transformed spermatic particles (figs. 61 to 63 h), being situated in the midst of the opake granules (figs. 61 to 63 c), give the ovum a most peculiar mottled appearance (figs. 62, 63).\n\nThat they are spermatic particles cannot be doubted, as we meet with them in all stages of transformation (figs. 61, 62 g, h); while the regularity in shape presented by the large oil-globules of the false ovum (figs. 53 to 55 e) is absent, as well as the running together of the granules (figs. 54, 55 c) by which they are formed.\n\nThe ovum immediately after the entrance of the spermatic particles (figs. 58 to 60 g) begins to acquire a chorion (figs. 61 to 63 f'). The formation of this chorion does not appear to be dependent at all on the penetration, but to be owing to the ovum having reached that part of the oviduct by which the membrane is secreted, because we find it occurring even in the unfecundated state.\n\nThis chorion, however (figs. 61 to 63 f'), differs from the granular shell of the false ovum (figs. 54 to 57 f'), in being perfectly smooth, membranous and transparent (figs. 61 to 63 f'), appearing as a single dark line, imperfect indeed at first, where protrusion of the granules exists (figs. 61, 62 f'), but gradually encircling the whole ovum (fig. 63 f').\n\nWhen first formed, the chorion is flaccid (fig. 63 f'), and the ovum appears of an irregular shape (fig. 63); but by the imbibition of fluid it swells up, becomes tense and spherical (Plate XXIX. fig. 64 f').\n\nThe spermatic particles (Plate XXVIII. figs. 61 to 63 h), after becoming enclosed and swollen, begin to disappear (Plate XXIX. fig. 64 h), probably by solution, leaving in their place a transparent fluid (fig. 65 m).\n\nThe vitelline granules that previous to the impregnation of the ovum formed one uniform, opake mass (Plate XXVIII. fig. 58 c), and partially broken up (figs. 59 to 63 c) by the penetration and swelling of the spermatic particles (figs. 59 to 63 h), are now still further excavated, separated, and detached into distinct masses by the solution of those particles (Plate XXIX. figs. 64, 65 c). This appears not only to be owing to the solution of the spermatic particles themselves, but to some direct influence that their solution has on the yolk, for many of the granules disappear entirely; while others are changed, both as regards colour and size (fig. 66 n), a transformation totally different to that which I have described as taking place in the false ovum (Plate XXVIII. fig. 56 c).\n\nSometimes the whole vitellus is thus broken up (Plate XXIX. fig 65 c), giving the ovum a beautifully mottled appearance; but more commonly it is only the surface\nthat is first affected (figs. 64, 66 c), the process of disintegration gradually passing towards the centre.\n\nThis mottled appearance (fig. 65) has been noticed by Reichert in the egg of a Strongylus, and ascribed by him to the formation of cells within the yolk, which is certainly not the case in the fertile ova of the Ascaris mystax.\n\nWhen there is much disintegration, the germinal vesicle may be seen with its germinal spot or nucleus (figs. 64 to 66 b, a), and occasionally within this (figs. 64, 65 a), again, another nucleolus (figs. 64, 65 k).\n\nBut in general the germinal vesicle (figs. 64, 65 b) cannot be seen; for, as the erosion of the yolk commences on the surface (fig. 66 c) and gradually passes towards the centre, the vesicle is always covered by a layer of opake granules.\n\nAs the solution of the yolk goes on, the opake granular mass in the centre becomes less and less, leaving a clear margin of fluid surrounding it on all sides (fig. 66 c). Some granules, however, escape, and are seen floating in the fluid; but they are larger in size, and more transparent than the original yolk-granules (fig. 66 n).\n\nAbout this period the ovum acquires another chorion, consisting generally of two membranes, and becomes more elliptical in form.\n\nThe three membranes that surround the ovum at this period, as they are all formed in the same way, and are exactly alike, may be considered as three layers of the same chorion (fig. 66 f'), secreted at different times by the oviduct.\n\nWhen the granular mass has been much reduced in size (fig. 66 c) it suddenly loses its opacity; and thus the whole vitellus is transformed into a few large, nearly transparent granules (fig. 67 n), among which we look in vain for a germinal vesicle; and only now and then are we able to distinguish one granule to be a little larger than its fellows (fig. 67 a), and to contain within it a dark spot (fig. 67 k).\n\nIn short, the germinal vesicle (figs. 64 to 66 b) ruptures, when disintegration has gone on to a certain length, and its disappearance is immediately followed by the transformation of the remaining vitelline granules.\n\nI propose to call these transformed or altered granules by the name of embryonic granules (figs. 67, 68 n), since they appear about the same time as the embryonic vesicle, and with it assist in forming the embryo.\n\nAfter the rupture of the germinal vesicle (figs. 64, 65 b), the interior of the egg is filled with the embryonic granules (fig. 67 n), not, however, packed close like the vitelline, but floating loose. About the centre of these granules, one a little larger than the rest (fig. 67 a) may sometimes be seen, having within it an opake spot (fig. 67 k). On comparing these with the nucleus and nucleolus of the germinal vesicle (fig. 64 a, k) before its rupture (fig. 64 b), I found them to resemble each other completely, having the same size, shape, and appearance, the same degree of refraction, and the same position.\n\nThe germinal vesicle immediately before its rupture (figs. 64, 65 b) is $\\frac{1}{1000}$th of an\ninch in diameter; its nucleus, or as it is commonly called, the germinal spot (figs. 64, 65 a), is $\\frac{1}{4000}$th of an inch, and the contained nucleolus $\\frac{1}{8000}$th of an inch (figs. 64, 65 k).\n\nAfter the rupture, the nucleus and nucleolus (fig. 67 a, k) are of exactly the same size, $\\frac{1}{4000}$th and $\\frac{1}{8000}$th of an inch respectively.\n\nBut soon the nucleus, which is at first solid (fig. 67 a), begins to enlarge, swells up, and constitutes a transparent cell (fig. 68 a); while the nucleolus remains of the same size (fig. 68 k), forming, in short, an embryonic vesicle and spot.\n\nAs soon as the embryonic vesicle (fig. 68 a) begins to form, a membrane separates from the internal surface of the chorion (fig. 69 f'), and gradually contracts (fig. 69 o) on the embryonic granules (fig. 69 n), till a perfect sphere is formed, whose breadth is nearly equal to the lesser internal diameter of the ovum (fig. 70 o).\n\nHow, or from what this membrane (fig. 70 o) is formed, I cannot speak with certainty, further than that it separates from the inner surface of the chorion (fig. 69 f'), and contracts on the embryonic granules (fig. 69 n) to form a true or embryonic yolk, exactly in the same way that it does (Plate XXVIII. fig. 56 o) in the false ovum (fig. 56) to form the opake or false yolk (fig. 56 c).\n\nIt is probable, therefore, that the formation of the yolk-membrane (Plate XXIX. fig. 70 o) is a physical process, unconnected with the fertility, or the individual vitality of the egg, as it takes place exactly at the same time, and in the same manner in the unfecundated or sterile ovum, into which the spermatic particles have never entered.\n\nWhen the membrane of the embryonic yolk first separates from the inner surface of the chorion, it encloses not only the embryonic granules (fig. 69 n), vesicle (fig. 68 a) and spot (fig. 68 k), but likewise the clear fluid in which they float; although, as contraction goes on, this fluid passes through the membrane (fig. 70 o) and occupies the space between it and the external envelopes (fig. 70 f'). It therefore acts the part of a sieve, allowing the fluid to pass, but retaining the granules, and bringing them within the influence of the embryonic vesicle (fig. 70 a).\n\nThe embryonic yolk is at first large and irregular in shape (fig. 69 o), but it soon becomes perfectly spherical (fig. 70 o), $\\frac{1}{60}$th of an inch in diameter, enclosing an embryonic vesicle and spot, whose sizes are $\\frac{1}{2000}$th and $\\frac{1}{6000}$th of an inch respectively (figs. 70 a, k).\n\nAt this period the egg (fig. 70) is oval, its longer diameter being $\\frac{1}{30}$th of an inch, and its shorter $\\frac{1}{50}$th of an inch; its membranes are firm and resisting (fig. 70 f'); and with this amount of organization it is expelled from the body of the mother.\n\nThe perfect ovum, therefore, consists of two or three homogeneous membranes, united to form one oval shell (fig. 70 f'), some limpid fluid (fig. 70 m), a spherical embryonic yolk membrane (fig. 70 o), embryonic granules (fig. 70 n), an embryonic vesicle (fig. 70 a), and its nucleus, the embryonic spot (fig. 70 k).\nCompare the fecundated (fig. 70) with the unfecundated ovum (Plate XXVIII. fig. 56), and one is immediately struck with the immense difference that exists between them.\n\nIn the false ovum there is no embryonic vesicle, no embryonic spot; while the substance that does exist, is apparently the colouring matter of the vitelline granules, collected into a structureless yolk (fig. 56 c), surrounded by a membrane (fig. 56 o), and the whole enclosed in a granular chorion (fig. 56 f') instead of a laminated shell (Plate XXIX. fig. 70 f').\n\nThe formation of the embryonic yolk membrane is not the effect of fecundation (fig. 70 o), because we see one produced in the sterile ovum; but after the entrance, swelling up, and solution of the spermatic particles, certain other changes are produced within the ovule, which do not occur otherwise.\n\nThe spermatic particles, by penetrating into the ovule, exert over it an influence of three distinct and somewhat opposed kinds.\n\nFirst. A preservative effect, preventing the decay, disappearance, and blending together of the vitelline granules, the germinal vesicle and spot.\n\nSecondly. A destructive or solvent influence, by which the vitelline granules and germinal vesicle are, after a time, gradually dissolved.\n\nThirdly. A power of transformation, by which the vitelline are changed into embryonic granules.\n\nThe preservative, destructive and transformative influences commence, as we have seen, with the union of the spermatic particles and ovule; they are conferred by the spermatic particles on the ovule, which continues to exist, while the sperm is destroyed by the act; and lastly, they appear all three to be of a purely chemical nature.\n\nThese properties once acquired, continue not only throughout the whole life of the creature, but remain after the death of the individual.\n\nTo one or other of these influences may all the changes that take place in the living body be ascribed, with the exception of those that are referrible to life alone.\n\nBut before entering on the consideration where life commences, and in what part it resides, it is essentially necessary that we make ourselves acquainted with the changes it effects in the ovum, by which the egg is transformed into an embryo, in all respects similar to the parent Ascaris; like it, capable of voluntary motion, assimilation, and the power to produce other ova.\n\nThese are most beautifully seen in the egg of the Ascaris mystax; but as they have been already described by far abler authors, I shall confine myself to a very brief outline of the changes as they occurred under my own observation.\n\nThe first alteration that the ovum undergoes is the division of the embryonic spot (Plate XXIX. fig. 72 k), and elongation of the embryonic vesicle (fig. 72 a).\n\nThis division is sometimes seen even before the germinal vesicle has disappeared (fig. 65 k), but does not take place normally till after the formation of the true or embryonic yolk (fig. 70 o).\nThe division of the nucleus (fig. 72 k) is immediately followed by that of its cell, the embryonic vesicle (fig. 73 a); and thus two embryonic vesicles are formed, each containing a separate nucleus or spot (fig. 73 k).\n\nAs soon as this has occurred, the two cells (fig. 73 a) are seen to separate and approach the opposite sides of the yolk; a portion of the yolk membrane (fig. 73 o) is protruded outwards, by the application of one of the embryonic cells against it. At first this protrusion is very slight (fig. 73 o), but by the continued movements of the vesicle (fig. 74 a) it becomes more and more increased, till at last the yolk assumes an oblong shape, with a constriction about the middle (fig. 74 o). The constriction gradually deepens, till at last two yolks are formed (fig. 75 o) by the sudden division of the investing membrane.\n\nI have repeatedly watched this process as it occurred under the microscope, and found that while the division of the embryonic vesicles takes from five to ten hours, the division of the yolk does not take more than thirty minutes.\n\nThe separation of the yolk into two parts is, I think, entirely a mechanical effect, and not produced by vitality inherent either in the yolk-granules (fig. 75 n) or membrane (fig. 75 o). For, besides the rapidity of its accomplishment, I have observed that the embryonic vesicles (figs. 73, 74 a) continue during the progress of the division to revolve round and round in circles; the one moulding the newly projected portion of the yolk membrane (figs. 73, 74 o) into a spherical form, while the other prevents the original part from collapsing.\n\nSometimes, when the formation of a yolk has been prevented by immersion in some preservative fluid, the division of the embryonic vesicle still takes place (fig. 71 a), and the two are generally seen occupying opposite ends of the egg, but without any membranous or granular investment.\n\nAs soon as the yolk has divided into two (fig. 75 o), a pause occurs. The two embryonic vesicles (fig. 75 a) remain stationary, their nuclei (fig. 75 k) subdivide, they themselves elongate, and ultimately separate into two each. Thus four embryonic vesicles are formed, two within each yolk mass, which, by the repetition of the same process, is redivided into four (fig. 76 o).\n\nOccasionally, when one embryonic vesicle divides more rapidly than its fellow, three yolk masses are produced; but this is rare, and not usually the case.\n\nAs this process is repeated from time to time, the number of the yolk masses increases from 4 (fig. 76 o) to 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, &c., till they (fig. 77 o) become so numerous and so minute as to appear like granules (fig. 78 o); yet each granule (fig. 78 o) is composed of a nucleus, an embryonic cell, yolk substance, and yolk-membrane.\n\nFrom the immense amount of subdivision and the number of interspaces caused by the spherical form of the granules, the whole egg is filled with them, giving it a dark or opake appearance (fig. 78).\n\nA membrane appears to form on the external surface of this opake mass, corre-\nsponding to the internal surface of the chorion; the production of which is attended with a loss of some of the most superficial granules.\n\nNext, a depression (fig. 79 p) of this membrane takes place on one of the sides. The depression is at first slight (fig. 79 p), but it gradually increases, forcing some of the granules before it, while others disappear by solution into a limpid fluid, which, passing through the membrane, occupies the space between it and the shell (fig. 79 r).\n\nA hemispherical mass is thus produced, but the central portion continues to advance, forming first a cup-like depression (fig. 80 p), and, ultimately touching the membrane of the opposite or convex side, unites with it, to produce a thick circular ring (fig. 81 p).\n\nThis fleshy ring (fig. 81 p) soon presents a constriction at one point (fig. 82 s). The constriction, by deepening, divides the ring, which is thus transformed into a cylindrical worm, bent round, so that the two ends are in apposition (fig. 83 s); and covered externally with the membrane (fig. 83 p), now become thick, while internally we still see nothing but granules (fig. 83 o).\n\nAs the body elongates, the two ends overlap, and are seen to be pointed. At first the overlapping is slight (fig. 83 s), but it gradually increases (Plate XXX. figs. 84, 85, 86 s), till at length the little worm forms nearly two turns of a spiral (figs. 87, 88 p), surrounded on all sides by fluid (figs. 87, 88 r) and the chorion, or shell (figs. 87, 88 f').\n\nBy rupturing the egg, the embryo worm is set free (fig. 89), and is seen to possess the three-lobed mouth (fig. 89 s), peculiar to the genus, and a very thick cuticle (fig. 89 p) enclosing a number of untransformed granules (fig. 89 o).\n\nThe development of the embryo is best observed by placing the females entire in spirits of turpentine for a fortnight or three weeks; at the end of which I have found the ovaries distended with ova, all of which contained young worms, not only fully developed (figs. 84 to 88), but alive, endeavouring their utmost to rupture the chorion, by rolling themselves up into a tight spiral (fig. 88 p), and then suddenly reversing the coil.\n\nLet us now return to the consideration as to which of these changes are vital, and which physical.\n\nThe most remarkable, as well as most apparent change that takes place in the ovum subsequent to penetration, is the division of the yolk, a phenomenon, which, although peculiar, seems to be entirely mechanical.\n\nFor the yolk membrane when at rest, as seen before the division of the yolk, assumes the spherical form, by its own molecular attraction (Plate XXIX. fig. 70 o); but when drawn out by the embryonic vesicles, acquires first a cylindrical shape, then that of an hour-glass, because that part of the membrane occupying the centre of the cylinder, having nothing to keep it distended, collapses; while the two ends are prevented from doing the same by the constant movements of the embryonic vesicles (fig. 74 a).\n\nWhen the hour-glass form (fig. 74 o) has been once attained, the molecular attrac-\ntion of the membrane tends no longer to draw it into a single sphere, but into two globules; and thus the division of the yolk is completed.\n\nThis view is further confirmed by the fact, that while the first steps of this process take, comparatively speaking, a long time, as soon as the hour-glass form has been once acquired, complete division is effected so suddenly that it is invisible; while a violent oscillatory motion is from the same cause communicated to the yolk masses, taking some little time to subside.\n\nThe division and movements of the embryonic vesicle, on the contrary, can only be ascribed to vitality.\n\nThat this division cannot be produced by the action of the spermatic particles on the embryonic vesicle, is evident from the fact, that it does not take place from without inwards, but from within outwards. The embryonic spot divides first; and this I have even seen to take place before the germinal vesicle has been ruptured, while it was still entire (fig. 65 k), and consequently long before the seminal fluid could possibly exert any influence over its nucleoli, imbedded as they are in the substance of the yet solid nucleus (fig. 65 a), surrounded by fluid, and protected by the germinal vesicle (fig. 65 b).\n\nThe fissiparous growth of the embryonic spot proves beyond a doubt that its division is caused by vitality inherent in it.\n\nThe embryonic vesicle, although owing its division to the nuclei it encloses, is also alive, because it grows in size, and when divided we see it move, not as some suppose, by mere electric repulsion; for I have most distinctly seen it continue to revolve in different directions, and in circles of various diameter.\n\nI am inclined to the belief that these movements of the embryonic vesicles are caused by vibratile cilia, from a certain amount of commotion among the yolk granules immediately surrounding the vesicle, observable only when the latter is in motion.\n\nBut the embryonic vesicle and spot are nothing else than the nucleus and nucleolus of the germinal vesicle. Is this, then, alive? Yes: because, when first thrown off by the ovary as a germinal particle (Plate XXVII. fig. 39 c), it is solid; the external layer of which by growth forms a vesicle (fig. 39 d), while the interior remains solid some time longer, and constitutes its nucleus (fig. 39 f').\n\nThis nucleus has been already shown to possess vitality, and as it exists in the germinal particle, it also must be alive.\n\nThe growth of the germinal vesicle, therefore, from the germinal particle, is as vital as the growth of the embryonic vesicle from its nucleus, the germinal spot.\n\nWe have seen that life does not originate at the period of fecundation; we have traced the vitality possessed by the ovum as far back as the very commencement of the ovule; we must therefore admit that it is derived from the mother.\n\nFor as the germinal particle is living when thrown off by the ovary, and as the\novary, being part of the female, shares her life, the vitality possessed by the germinial particle can only be derived from that of the mother.\n\nFrom this, it appears that the embryo or young *Ascaris mystax* obtains its vitality solely from the mother, but that certain conditions are necessary for the continuance, maintenance and development of that life; and that these conditions are alone furnished by the changes effected by the product of the male, on the matters immediately surrounding the living cell.\n\nWhen the male secretion is not present, when the above conditions are not fulfilled, life ceases; the vital point dies; and although the surrounding substance does not immediately perish, yet it no longer encloses a germinial vesicle, or even a germinial spot.\n\nFinally, I would desire to draw attention to the beautiful analogy that exists between the products of the ovarian and testicular tubes. The cæcal extremities, of both the male and female reproductive systems, throw off solid particles of the same size, shape and appearance; both kinds soon present spots in their centres, and both swell up into nucleated cells. Yet the one is a seminal, and the other a germinial vesicle.\n\nGranules are now accumulated round both. Both might be called ovules with equal propriety; so analogous are they in structure, that size alone distinguishes them. But the one is an ovule, and the other a granular mass.\n\nThe granular matter of the ovule dissolves, the germinial vesicle enlarges and disappears, setting free its nucleus.\n\nThe seminal mass likewise loses its granular covering; the seminal vesicle enlarges, and by disappearing, its nucleus is also set free.\n\nThus far the analogy is complete, but here it ends; the transformed nucleus of the male cell enters the granular vitelline substance of the female ovule, perishing by solution; while the nucleus of the germinial vesicle enlarges, divides, subdivides and redivides, till a mass of granules are formed, each possessed of an individual existence, and together capable of producing a living whole; a worm in every respect like its parent, endowed, like it, with the powers of assimilation, locomotion, and reproduction.\n\nA new life therefore is not generated during the development of a new being, by the happy combination of physical forces; but the same life bestowed by God at the creation, continues without intermission, transmitted from mother to offspring, pervading and redeveloping itself in each individual member of the species.\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.\n\nPLATE XXV*.\n\nFig. 1.
