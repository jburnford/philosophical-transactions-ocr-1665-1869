  "text": "More Wayes\nFor the same Purpose, Intimated by M. Hook.\n\nI have by me (saith Mr. H.) two or three several wayes of Measuring the Diameters of the Planets, whether Horizontal, Perpendicular, or Inclined, to the exactness of a Second, by the help of a Telescope: As also, of taking the Position and Distance of the Small Fixt Stars one from another, or from any of the less bright Planets, if the Distance be not above two or three Degrees.\n\nThe Particulars hereof, the Author refers to the next Opportunity.\n\nObservations\nOf the Star, called Nebulosa, in the Girdle of Andromeda; and of the Wondrous Star in the Neck of the Whale: made and communicated by Monsieur Bullialdus.\n\nAnno 1667. in January, when the Cloudy and Misty weather, which had continued for a good while, did permit us to observe, the Star Nebulosa, in the Girdle of Andromeda (which may well enough be seen by the bare Eye) appeared much obscurer than the Year before. In the Months of February and March I did not see it.\n\nAnno 1667, January 20. at Night, h. 6.30. the Sky being pretty serene, the Star in the Neck of the Whale, did approach to the bigness of a Star of the Sixth Magnitude, and grew bigger afterwards.\n\nFebruary 12, h. 6.30'. I saw the same again, equalling now a Star of the Fourth Magnitude at least.\n\nFebruary 24, h. 7. This Star was equal to those of the Third Magnitude, shining very bright.\nFebruary 26, The same appeared yet to increase; as also February 27. But after this time I could not see it, by reason of the ill weather.\n\nThe same Astronomer did subjoin the following Extract of a Letter he received from Monsieur Hevelius, March 15, 1667, concerning such another Star; viz.\n\nI have watched the New Star in the Neck of the Whale, as often as the weather would give me leave, which it hath done but seldom this Winter. In January, the 3, 4, 5, 7, and 13 days, it did not yet appear. From this time, the Sky was continually overcast till January 23, on which day, I found a little Star of the Sixth or Seventh Magnitude, about the same place where the said New Star used to appear. But it then seemed to me not the genuine New Star, but another, to wit, preceding the New; whose Longitude hath been defined by me in Mercurius in Sole visus in Aries, gr. 25. 45'. 3\". and the Latitude gr. 14. 41'. 32\". South, Anno 1660.\n\nThen from January 23, to February 2, it was Cloudy weather again; but this second of February, it appear'd very bright, and that when the Moon shone, of the bigness of that in the Mouth of the Whale, or Nodo Lini: from which time I always observed it to grow bigger. March 13. I did still find it extremely bright, but could not by my naked Eye, because of the vivid Crepuscle, and the low site of the Star, accurately determine its Magnitude.\n\nI have received (saith he further) your two Monita ad Astro-\nSee Numb. 22. of these nomos; and the Discourse hath much pleased me,\nTransactions, p. 381, 382, where an account is given of these two Monita of M. Bulli-\naldus. of this, and other New Stars, another Hypothesis; but I cannot thereby so accurately divine the Appearances, as you will read more largely in its due place.",
