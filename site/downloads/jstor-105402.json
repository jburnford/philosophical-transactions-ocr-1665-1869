S.\n\nParis, Feb. 18, 1760.\n\nRead March 6, 1760.\n\nI'LL venture to send you some of my observations on the present comet, because bad weather may have prevented it from being seen in England.\n\n| Equal time | Longitude | North latitude |\n|------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Feb. 8     | 9 29 28   | 3 26 42        |\n|            | 8 48 50   | 4 46 28        |\n| 11         | 7 22 35   | 7 14 50        |\n| 13         | 7 47 4    | 8 24 18        |\n| 14         | 6 41 0    | 10 30 9        |\n\nThese observations, together with another made at Marseilles, (on the first day) at $9^h\\ 55'\\ 38''$ equal time, when the longitude of the comet was found in $\\Omega\\ 23^\\circ\\ 29'\\ 46''$, and its north latitude $31'\\ 20''$, have enabled me to compute the elements of its orbit. Its motion is direct. The ascending node is in $\\Omega\\ 19^\\circ\\ 42'\\ 0''$, and the place of the perihelion in $\\varpi\\ 26^\\circ\\ 41'\\ 22''$. The inclination of the orbit is $80^\\circ\\ 51'\\ 30''$, and the distance of the perihelion $\\frac{85248}{100000}$ of the radius of the orbit of the earth. The comet passed the perihelion Nov. 25, 1759, at $20^h\\ 55'$, mean time, at Paris. These computations will be further improved by the observations I still hope to make; but they are sufficient to find the comet's place in the heavens.\n\nVol. LI.",
