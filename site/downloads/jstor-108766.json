Matthiessen, Ph.D.\n\nCommunicated by Professor Wheatstone.\n\nReceived November 17,—Read December 22, 1859.\n\nBefore commencing a research on the law of the conducting power for electricity of alloys, it was considered necessary to determine their specific gravities; to ascertain whether they expand or contract, so as to be able to account for differences which might be obtained in their conducting powers.\n\nThe metals used for the alloys were those which were easily obtained in a pure state in large quantities, and were purified as follows:\n\n1. Antimony.—By Liebig's process.\n2. Tin.—Commercial metal dissolved in nitric acid, and the binoxide reduced by charcoal.\n3. Cadmium.—Commercial metal dissolved in hydrochloric acid and precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen; the sulphide dissolved in hydrochloric acid and precipitated by carbonate of soda; the carbonate heated, a part of the oxide reduced by hydrogen, and the rest distilled with charcoal.\n4. Bismuth.—Commercial metal dissolved in nitric acid, precipitated by water and reduced by charcoal.\n5. Silver.—Reduced from the pure chloride by fusion with carbonate of soda. The greater part of the silver used for making the alloys was procured in a state of purity from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey.\n6. Lead.—Commercial acetate recrystallized three times and heated.\n7. Mercury.—Commercial metal treated with nitric acid, and allowed to stand with it about a month, being at intervals well-shaken.\n8. Gold.—Prepared by precipitating chloride of gold by algaroth powder, &c., and also by precipitation of the chloride of gold by protosulphate of iron*, &c. Some of the gold employed was procured pure from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey.\n\nThe quantity of each alloy made was about 20 grms.; the two metals were weighed out accurately in proper proportions, and fused together in a porcelain crucible; a jet of gas being allowed to play in the same from above to prevent the oxidation of the metals. The alloys were cast in a wooden mould, a porcelain slab (previously blackened by holding it over a gas flame to prevent the adhering of the metal) forming the bottom. They were always re-fused and re-cast, at least three times, before the first determination was made, then re-fused before they were determined a second time, and again before\n\n* See Appendix at the end of my paper \"On the Electric Conducting Power of Alloys,\" in this volume, p. 175.\n\nMDCCCLX.\nthe third determination; often being re-cast several times, as the castings did not always succeed. To prevent as much as possible the formation of internal cavities from crystallization, the alloys were cast very thin, the thickness of the casting being in most cases about 3 to 4 millims.\n\nThe method employed for taking the specific gravities, was that of hanging the alloys by a very fine platinum wire in distilled water, which had been boiled to free it from air, and allowed to cool \\textit{in vacuo}. This method gave better results than that of weighing the metal or alloy in a bottle filled with water, on account of the difficulty of perfectly drying the bottle when full, and obtaining the same weight twice following.\n\nThe amalgams which were liquid, and those not sufficiently hard to hang by the platinum wire, were weighed in a glass tube to which a platinum wire was soldered.\n\nThe weight of the tube alone in air and water was determined at the temperature at which the experiments were made, and therefore, in calculating the specific gravities, these values had only to be subtracted from those found.\n\nThe balance used was one of Liebiech's, which turns to the 0·1 mgr. when loaded with 100 grms. in each pan; and when the alloy was weighed in water, it turned to the 0·2 mgr. The air adhering to the alloy, when weighed in water, was removed by a soft brush, the alloy being brushed until its weight became constant.\n\nIn calculating the specific gravities, the weight of the water displaced was corrected for the temperature, so that the unit is in all cases distilled water at 0° C. A similar correction could not be made for the temperature of the alloys, as their coefficients of expansion are not known. All the weighings were reduced to a vacuum, and a correction was made for that part of the platinum wire which dipped in the water. The length of wire dipping in was about 60 millims., which weighed 8 mgrs.; these would lose in water about 0·35 mgr. Supposing, as is really the case, that sometimes 10 millims. more or less dipped in, the error made would be about 0·06 mgr.; but as the 0·3 mgr. only make an error, if not brought into calculation, in most cases of about 0·001 per cent. of the specific gravity found, the error made in this way may be overlooked.\n\nThe equivalents used for calculating the quantities of metal required for the alloys were—\n\n| Element     | Equivalent |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Antimony    | 122·3      |\n| Tin         | 58         |\n| Cadmium     | 56         |\n| Bismuth     | 208        |\n| Silver      | 108        |\n| Lead        | 103·7      |\n| Mercury     | 100        |\n| Gold        | 197        |\n\nTable I. gives the specific gravities of the pure metals employed, and the temperature (T.) in the Centigrade scale: the values given are the results of three consecutive determinations. On account of the number of alloys experimented with, it was considered as well, in order to save space, only to give the mean of the three determinations; and\n\n* Dexter, Poggendorff's 'Annalen,' vol. c. p. 563.

The values, however, were found to be correct.\n\n† No concordant results could be obtained with this metal. Experiments were made with it after having been fused under borax, chloride of sodium, charcoal, in hydrogen. The above value is the mean of a number of determinations which varied between 10·424 and 10·511.\n\nSome specimens of not quite pure silver were lent me by Mr. Ph. Worsley, who prepared them as follows:\n\nThe silver was made as hot as possible, and well-stirred with a stick of charcoal before pouring. The mould was a steel one, forming a bar of about 25 millims. square and about 300 millims. high. The bar weighed about 2½ kilogrammes. The top of it, when cold, showed a funnel-shaped depression, and the soundest part of it was about two-thirds down, and from this different pieces were cut, which gave very good results. The values obtained were 10·504, 16°7; 10·505, 17°2; 10·502, 19°2. A second bar gave similar numbers; they were 10·500, 24°5; 10·496, 24°8; 10·492, 25°0.\nThe specific gravity of an alloy is calculated from the above formulae, under the supposition that the specific gravity of the metals employed take part of that of the alloy in the ratio of their relative volumes (1.), equivalents (2.), or weights (3.). Of these formulae only the first is for all cases correct, supposing the alloy neither contracts nor expands; the second only when the volumes and equivalents of the metals employed are in the same ratio with each other, as in the case of gold, silver, &c.; and the third only when the specific gravities of the two metals are equal. The two last methods of calculation are here mentioned, as several chemists have calculated their results from these formulae.\n\n**Table II.**\n\nAntimony-Tin Series (determined by Mr. C.

The gold-lead alloys appear all to be crystalline, that is, their surface is very much so, but their fracture is glassy. The following alloys expand greatly on cooling, so much so, that the liquid metal breaks through the crust, forming large or small globules, viz. all those of bismuth-antimony, bismuth-gold, and bismuth-lead, which were experimented on; those of bismuth-tin, from Bi₂₀ Sn to Bi₉ Sn, the rest of the series very slightly; and bismuth-lead, viz. Bi₃₀ Pb to Bi₄ Pb (Bi₂ Pb slightly), the rest apparently not at all. Of the bismuth-cadmium series, Bi Cd₆ and Bi Cd₄ expand very slightly, the rest not at all. No concordant results could be obtained with any zinc-tin or zinc-cadmium alloys, on account of their very crystalline structure.\n\nIn conclusion, my best thanks are due to Dr. M. Holzmann, Mr. C. Long, and Mr. M. Cartt for their assistance in carrying out the foregoing determinations.",
