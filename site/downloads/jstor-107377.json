S.\n\nRead June 15, 1815.\n\nThe term function has long been introduced into analysis with great advantage, for the purpose of designating the result of every operation that can be performed on quantity. This extent of signification has rendered it of essential use, but the various applications of which it admits, and the questions to which it gives rise, do not appear to have met with sufficient attention.\n\nI propose in the following paper to present an outline of a new calculus, which naturally results from it. It comprehends questions of the greatest generality and difficulty, and will probably require the invention of new methods for its improvement.\n\nMany of the calculations with which we are familiar, consist of two parts, a direct, and an inverse; thus, when we consider an exponent of a quantity: to raise any number to a given power, is the direct operation: to extract a given root of any number, is the inverse method. The differential calculus, which is a direct method, naturally gave rise to the integral, which is its inverse: the same remark is applicable to finite differences. In all these cases the inverse method is by far the most difficult, and it might perhaps be added, the most useful.\nIt is this inverse method with respect to functions, which I at present propose to consider.\n\nIf an unknown quantity as $x$, be given by means of an equation, it becomes a question how to determine its value; similarly if an unknown function as $\\psi$, be given by means of any functional equation, it is required to assign its form. In the first case, it is quantity which is to be determined; in the second, it is the form assumed by quantity, that becomes the subject of investigation. In the one case, the various powers of the unknown quantity enter into the equation; in the other, the different orders of the function are concerned.\n\nBefore I proceed, it will be proper to explain the meaning of the order of a functional equation, and likewise to indicate the notation made use of; $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\&c.$ are known functional characteristics; $\\psi, \\chi, \\psi$, are unknown ones.\n\nIf in any function as $\\psi x$, instead of $x$, the original function be substituted, it becomes $\\psi \\psi x$ or $\\psi^2 x$: this is called the second function of $x$. If the process be repeated, the result is $\\psi^3 x$ or $\\psi^n x$, the third function of $x$; and similarly $\\psi^n x$, denotes the $n^{th}$ function of $x$. Suppose\n\n$$\\psi x = a + x$$\n\nthen $$\\psi^2 x = a + a + x = 2a + x$$\n\nand generally $$\\psi^n x = na + x$$\n\nA functional equation is said to be of the first order, when it contains only the first function of the unknown quantity; as, for instance,\n\n$$\\psi \\alpha x + x \\psi x - x^n = 0$$\n\n$$(\\psi x + \\psi \\frac{1}{x})^n - ax + x^2 = 0.$$\nIf the second function enter, the equation rises to the second order: thus,\n\n\\[ \\psi^2 x = x \\]\n\\[ \\psi(x + \\psi x) + (\\psi x - x)^2 = 0 \\]\n\\[ (\\psi^2 x + \\psi \\frac{1}{x})^n = ax \\]\n\nA function of two variables admits of two second functions: thus \\( \\psi(x, y) \\) becomes \\( \\psi(\\psi(x, y), y) \\), and \\( \\psi(x, \\psi(x, y)) \\) or they might be thus expressed \\( \\psi^{2,1}(x, y) \\) and \\( \\psi^{1,2}(x, y) \\).\n\nThese express the second functions; the first taken relative to \\( x \\), the other relative to \\( y \\). But besides these two there is another, which arises from taking the second function simultaneously relative to \\( x \\), and \\( y \\); it is \\( \\psi\\{\\psi(x, y), \\psi(x, y)\\} \\). This ought not to be written \\( \\psi^{2,2}(x, y) \\) for it is not the second function first taken relative to \\( x \\) and then to \\( y \\), nor is it the converse of this. In fact, the notation is defective; some method is wanting of indicating the order in which the successive substitutions are made. I shall for the present lay aside the consideration of functional equations, involving more than one variable.\n\nThose of the first order have long been known, but the method in which I have treated them is, I believe, entirely new. Equations of the second and higher orders have never been even mentioned; it is these which present the most interesting speculations, and which are involved in the greatest difficulties. I shall first give some account of the enquiries which led me to this subject, and shall then treat of the various orders of functional equations.\n\nSome few years since, while considering a problem mentioned by Pappus, relating to the inscription of a number\nof circles in a semicircle, the following question occurred to me.\n\nIf in an hyperbola between its asymptotes a circle be inscribed touching both asymptotes and the curve, and if another circle be inscribed touching the first circle, the curve, and one asymptote, and if this be continued as represented in the figure, what ratio does the area of the circles bear to that of the figure; and conversely, if this ratio is given, what is the nature of the curve? I soon perceived the great difficulty of the subject, and that these and other problems similar to the latter of them, required the application of methods totally different from any with which I was then acquainted.\n\nHopeless of success, I laid aside the subject until about two years after, when the same difficulty recurred under another form. I had proposed to myself the following problem:\n\nWhat must be the nature of the curve ABC, such that if any point C be taken, and the ordinate CD, the normal CE, and subnormal DE be drawn, and if the triangle CDE be turned into such a position that CD may become the base and DE the perpendicular, if DE coincide with some new ordinate as GB, then the normal CE at the first point shall coincide with the normal BF at the second?\nThis latter question, of far less difficulty than the former, was readily solved, but I did not at first observe that they rested on similar principles; this, however, was pointed out by Mr. Herschel, to whom I had mentioned the subject. Such was the origin of the following enquiries.\n\nThe question, in its most general point of view, is the solution of functional equations of all orders.\n\nThis, however, is a generality which I do not pretend to have attained. In the first part of this Paper the reader will find a new method of solving all functional equations of the first order; it depends on possessing their particular solutions. In the subsequent part, I have given various methods of solving functional equations of the second and higher orders: some of these possess considerable generality; and if we consider only those in which the $n^{th}$ and inferior orders enter simply, such as\n\n$$F \\{ x, \\psi x, \\psi^2 x, \\ldots \\psi^n x \\} = 0$$\n\nI have pointed out the means of obtaining their solutions.\n\nThe determination of functions from given conditions most probably took its rise from the integration of equations of partial differentials; and we accordingly find that the authors of this calculus were soon engaged in the new problem to which it gave birth. D'Alembert was the first who occupied himself with this subject: he was soon followed by Euler and Lagrange; but it is to Monge that we are indebted for the most general view of the subject. His enquiries were directed to the determination of two functions from given conditions; they are contained in the fifth volume of the Melanges de Turin, and in two Papers in the seventh volume of the Memoires des Savans Etrangers, 1773.\n\nMDCCCXV.\nIn the first of these he explains the solution of several functional equations by means of curves of double curvature, and by curve surfaces.\n\nIn the second Paper, the question is treated in a more analytical method, and he endeavours to reduce it to the solution of equations of differences. \"Je me propose,\" observes Monge, \"de faire voir que la determination des fonctions arbitraires qui se trouvent dans l'integrale d'une equation aux differences partielles, depend en general, dans les cas que je n'ai pas encore traités, de l'integrale d'une ou de plusieurs équations aux differences finies, dans lesquelles le rapport de la variable principale à sa difference finie est donné soit qu'il soit variable soit qu'il soit constant.\"\n\nIn the same volume is a paper of Laplace on this subject, which he views in the same light, and endeavours to reduce functional equations of the first order to those of finite differences. This skilful analyst first solved the functional equation $F \\{ x, \\phi x, \\phi \\alpha x, \\} = 0$. The method he made use of is peculiarly elegant; he converted it into an equation of finite differences in which the difference was constant. Still, however, it appeared by no means the most direct method to make use of such an expedient, nor was it even known that all equations of the first order admitted of its application. This latter objection was, however, removed by Mr. Herschel, who in an excellent paper on functional equations, has extended the method made use of by Laplace to the solution of all equations of the first order. His solution is equally elegant and general; it leaves nothing to be regretted, but the narrow limits of our knowledge respecting the integration of equations of finite differences. From this and other causes, I am still\ninclined to think that the solution of functional equations must be sought by methods peculiarly their own. There are some other researches on this difficult subject of which I am unable to give any account, from the impossibility of procuring the works in which they are contained; among these is the paper of Arbogast, which gained the prize of the Academy of Petersburg in the year 1790.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, I shall call any solution of a functional equation which contains one or more arbitrary functions, a general solution; but if the solution of such an equation only contains arbitrary constants, I shall call it a particular solution. With respect to the number of arbitrary functions that may enter into any solution, I shall make some observations at the conclusion of this paper.\n\n**Problem I.**\n\nRequired the general solution of the functional equation,\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\psi \\alpha x \\]\n\nsupposing we are acquainted with one particular solution.\n\nLet the particular solution be \\( f x = f \\alpha x \\); then take \\( \\psi = \\phi f \\), \\( \\phi \\) being an arbitrary function. It is evident that this value of \\( \\psi \\) will satisfy the original equation, and that\n\n\\[ \\phi f x = \\phi f \\alpha x \\]\n\nis identical, because \\( f x = f \\alpha x \\).\n\nExample, let the equation be\n\n\\[ \\psi (x) = \\psi (-x) \\]\n\nand the particular solution be\n\n\\[ f x = x^2 \\]\n\nthe general solution is\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\phi (x^2) \\]\n\nwhich evidently answers the conditions.\nAs I shall have frequent occasion to make use of symmetrical functions of two or more quantities, I shall for the sake of brevity denote this by putting a line over the functional characteristic; thus $\\phi(x,y)$ represents a symmetrical function of $x$ and $y$, which it is well known possesses the following property,\n\n$$\\phi \\{ x, y \\} = \\phi \\{ y, x \\}$$\n\nAs we are only considering functional equations of one variable, this will be sufficient for the present purpose; it might perhaps otherwise be more advisable to put the line over the quantities relative to which the function is symmetrical; thus $\\phi \\{ x, y, z, v \\}$ is symmetrical relative to $z$ and $v$, but it is not so in respect to the other variables. This would possess the advantage of readily designating a function symmetrical relative to two quantities in one way, and likewise symmetrical with respect to two others, but in a different manner,* thus\n\n$$\\phi \\{ x, y, z, v \\}$$\n\na particular case of this is\n\n$$\\frac{v + z + axy}{v^3 - ax^2y^2}$$\n\nwhich is symmetrical in one sense relative to $x$ and $y$, and in a different sense with respect to $v$ and $z$; but these belong to other enquiries.\n\n**Problem II.**\n\nRequired a general solution of the equation $\\psi x = \\psi \\alpha x$, having given a particular solution of $f x = f \\alpha^2 x$\n\n---\n\n*This is not a mere imaginary refinement; I have constantly had occasion to make use of functions of many variables which were symmetrical by pairs, when investigating the nature of functional equations of more than one variable.*\nAssume \\( \\psi x = \\phi \\{ f x, f x \\} \\) then it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\phi \\{ f x, f x \\} = \\phi \\{ f \\alpha x, f \\alpha x \\}\n\\]\n\nthis equation will be satisfied if we determine \\( f \\) and \\( f \\), so that the following equations may be fulfilled.\n\n\\[\nf \\alpha x = f x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f \\alpha x = f x\n\\]\n\nfrom these result \\( f \\alpha^2 x = f \\alpha x = f x \\).\n\nbut we have by hypothesis a particular solution of \\( f \\alpha^2 x = f x \\),\n\ntherefore the general solution of \\( \\psi x = \\psi \\alpha x \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\psi x = \\phi \\{ f x, f \\alpha x \\}\n\\]\n\nIf the function \\( \\alpha \\) should be of such a nature that \\( \\alpha^2 x = x \\), or even if \\( \\alpha^n x = x \\), \\( f x \\) will then become \\( x \\).\n\nfor example, suppose \\( \\psi x = \\psi \\left( \\frac{x}{ax-1} \\right) \\)\n\nthen since \\( \\alpha x = \\frac{x}{ax-1} \\), \\( \\alpha^2 x = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{x}{ax-1} \\right) = \\frac{x}{ax-1} = x \\)\n\nand we have \\( \\psi x = \\phi \\{ x, \\frac{x}{ax-1} \\} \\)\n\na particular case of this is when \\( a = 0 \\), \\( \\psi (x) = \\psi (-x) \\), its solution is\n\n\\[\n\\psi x = \\phi \\{ x, -x \\} = \\phi (x^2)\n\\]\n\nthe same as in the last Problem; as another example take\n\n\\[\n\\psi x = \\psi \\frac{1}{x}\n\\]\n\nthen since \\( \\alpha x = \\frac{1}{x} \\), \\( \\alpha^2 x = \\frac{1}{x} = x \\) and \\( \\psi x = \\phi \\{ x, \\frac{1}{x} \\} \\).\n\nThis affords a solution to the following question:\n\nRequired the nature of a curve, such that if any two abscissae, whose rectangle is equal to a given square be taken, their corresponding ordinates may also be equal.\nLet \\( y = \\psi x \\) be the equation of the curve, also \\( AN = x \\), and if \\( AN \\times AM = a^2 \\), then the property of the curve is that \\( PN = QM \\), but \\( PN = y = \\psi x \\), and \\( QM = \\psi (AM) = \\psi \\left( \\frac{a^2}{x} \\right) \\) consequently the equation from which \\( \\psi \\) must be determined, is\n\n\\[\n\\psi x = \\psi \\frac{a^2}{x}\n\\]\n\nits solutions in\n\n\\[\ny = \\psi x = \\phi \\left\\{ x, \\frac{a^2}{x} \\right\\},\n\\]\n\nif we make \\( y = x + \\frac{a^2}{x} \\), it becomes \\( yx - x^2 = a^2 \\), an equation to the hyperbola.\n\n**Problem III.**\n\nRequired the general solution of \\( \\psi x = A x \\times \\psi a x \\); having a particular solution, and also one of \\( \\psi x = \\psi a^2 x \\).\n\nAssume \\( \\psi x = fx \\times \\phi \\left\\{ fx, fx \\right\\} \\)\n\nmaking this substitution in the original equation, it becomes\n\n\\[\nfx \\times \\phi \\left\\{ fx, fx \\right\\} = A x \\times fa x \\phi \\left\\{ fax, fax \\right\\} \\text{ make } fa x = fx,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nfax = fx, \\text{ from this it results that } fx = fa^2 x \\text{ of which we possess a particular solution, divide both sides by } \\phi \\left\\{ fax, fax \\right\\} \\text{ then we have }\n\\]\n\n\\[\nfx = Ax \\times fa x;\n\\]\n\nthis is nothing more than the original equation of which, and of \\( fx = fa^2 x \\), we have by hypothesis particular solutions:\ntherefore its general solution is,\n\n\\[ \\psi x = f x \\times \\phi \\{ f x, f a x \\} \\]\n\nThe same equation may be solved differently, if we are acquainted with particular solutions of the equations\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\psi a x, \\text{ and } \\psi x = A x \\times \\psi a x. \\]\n\nAssume \\( \\psi x = f x \\times \\phi x \\), it becomes\n\n\\[ f x \\times \\phi x = A x \\times f a x \\times \\phi a x, \\]\n\nlet \\( f x \\) be the particular solution of the original equation, then\n\n\\[ f x = A x \\times f a x, \\]\n\nand by division\n\n\\[ \\phi x = \\phi a x, \\]\n\nbut of this also we have given a particular solution, call it \\( f x \\),\n\ntherefore the general expression of \\( \\psi x \\), is\n\n\\[ \\psi x = f x \\times \\phi f x. \\]\n\nLet us take for example the equation\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\frac{1-x^2}{1-2x} \\psi \\frac{x}{x-1} \\]\n\nthe particular value of \\( \\psi x \\) is\n\n\\[ f x = 1 + x, \\]\n\nand the particular case of\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\psi \\frac{x}{2x-1} \\text{ is } f x = \\frac{x^2}{x-1}, \\]\n\nfrom these considerations the general solution is\n\n\\[ \\psi x = (1 + x) \\phi \\frac{x^2}{x-1} \\]\n\nwhich will on trial be found to satisfy the equation.*\n\n* Another particular solution of\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\psi \\frac{x}{x-1} \\text{ is } \\psi x = \\cos, \\log_1 (x-1) \\]\n\nthis gives for the general solution of\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\frac{1-x^2}{1-2x} \\psi \\frac{x}{x-1} \\]\n\n\\[ \\psi x = (1 + x) \\phi (\\cos, \\log_1 (x-1)). \\]\nAs another example, take\n\n\\[ \\psi x = -\\frac{1}{x} \\psi \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\nthe particular solutions are, that of the equation itself\n\n\\[ f x = \\frac{x-1}{x} \\]\n\nand that of \\( \\psi x = \\psi \\frac{1}{x} \\) is known to be \\( \\phi(x, \\frac{1}{x}) \\), hence the general solution is\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\frac{x-1}{x} \\phi \\left( x, \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \\]\n\nwhich, as is readily seen, fulfills the condition.\n\n**Problem IV.**\n\nRequired the general solution of\n\n\\[ \\psi x = A x \\times \\psi \\alpha x + B x, \\]\n\nhaving given a particular solution \\( f x \\)\n\nAssume \\( \\psi x = f x + \\phi x \\), then \\( \\psi \\alpha x \\) becomes \\( f \\alpha x + \\phi \\alpha x \\),\n\nand the equation is\n\n\\[ f x + \\phi x = A x \\times f \\alpha x + A x \\times \\phi \\alpha x + B x, \\]\n\nsubtracting from this the particular solution \\( f x = A x \\times f \\alpha x + B x \\), which is given by hypothesis, there remains\n\n\\[ \\phi x = A x \\times \\phi \\alpha x, \\]\n\nthis equation may be solved by Prob. III, and we thence obtain the general solution of the given equation.\n\nFrom this may readily be deduced the solution of the following equations:\n\n\\[ \\psi (\\varepsilon^y) \\pm (\\varepsilon^{-y}) = Ay \\]\n\nsuppose \\( f \\) is a particular solution, take \\( \\psi y = fy + x y \\), the equation becomes\n\n\\[ f (\\varepsilon^y) \\pm f (\\varepsilon^{-y}) + x (\\varepsilon^y) \\pm x (\\varepsilon^{-y}) = Ay, \\]\n\nbut we have from the particular solution\n\n\\[ f (\\varepsilon^y) \\pm f (\\varepsilon^{-y}) = Ay, \\]\nthis subtracted from the former, leaves\n\n\\[ x(\\varepsilon^y) \\pm x(\\varepsilon^{-y}) = 0. \\]\n\nLet us first consider the upper sign, then a particular solution of\n\n\\[ x(\\varepsilon^y) = -x(\\varepsilon^{-y}), \\]\n\nis \\( x(y) = (\\log y)^{2n+1}. \\)\n\nIf we take the lower sign, then a solution of\n\n\\[ x(\\varepsilon^y) = x(\\varepsilon^{-y}) \\]\n\nis \\( x(y) = (\\log y)^{2n}. \\)\n\nFrom these considerations it appears, that the general solutions of the given equations are\n\n\\[ \\psi y = fy + \\phi \\left\\{ (\\log y)^{2n+1} \\right\\} \\]\n\nand \\( \\psi y = fy + \\phi \\left\\{ (\\log y)^{2n} \\right\\} \\)\n\naccording as the upper or under sign is used.\n\nThe equation just solved was not constructed as an example to this particular rule, but is selected because it has actually occurred. It is used by Mr. Herschel in the Philosophical Transactions, 1814, for the purpose of assigning the sums of several very curious series. He there observes, that when the upper sign is used \\( ^{2n}L(1+y) \\), and when the lower takes place \\( ^{2n+1}L(1+y) \\), are particular solutions, these may therefore be generalized by the introduction of an arbitrary function\n\nIf \\( \\psi e^y + \\psi e^{-y} = \\text{a rational function of } y \\text{ containing only even powers,} \\)\n\nor if \\( \\psi e^y -

F\\{\\bar{\\phi}' x, \\bar{\\phi}' f x, \\bar{\\phi}' f^2 x, \\ldots \\bar{\\phi}' f^n x\\} = 0 \\quad (a) \\]\n\nwhich is an equation of the first order relative to \\( \\bar{\\phi}' \\) and may be solved by the methods in the beginning of this Paper, or, by means of the method given by Mr. Herschel, to which we have already alluded.\n\nWith respect to the function \\( f \\) it is arbitrary, there are however, some observations respecting it, which require notice; as without an attention to them we might fall into error. In the first place, it is evident, that we must not\nmake $fx$ equal to $x$, for in this case we at once determine $\\psi x$ to be equal to $x$, which is not always true.\n\nThe same observation may be made with respect to making $f^3 x = x$, for in this case $\\psi^3 x = \\psi x$, $\\psi^4 x = x$, $\\psi^5 x = \\psi x$, and we in fact by assuming this value for $f$ determine $\\psi$ from the equation\n\n$$F \\{ x, \\psi x, x, \\psi x, x, \\&c. \\} = 0$$\n\nThe same objection does not hold when we make $f^3 x = x$, though this considerably limits the generality of the solution; apparently the most eligible mode of determining $f$ is from the equation $f^n + 1 x = x$, for in this case supposing we are acquainted with a particular solution of (a) containing any number of arbitrary constants, such as\n\n$$\\phi x = A \\{ x, a, b, c, \\&c. \\}$$\n\nwe may substitute for each of these constants an arbitrary function, such as\n\n$$\\bar{x} \\{ x, fx, f^2 x, \\ldots f^n x \\}$$\n\nfor it is evident this function does not change when we substitute $f^n x$ for $x$.\n\nBut this form of $f$ is not always correct, it may be inconsistent with the original equation. In fact, the only value we can assign to $f$ which shall not in some measure limit the generality of the Problem, is to suppose a particular solution of the given equation.\n\nAs an example of this method take the following problem.\nRequired the nature of the curve ADE such that taking any abscissa AB and corresponding ordinate DB: if the abscissa AC be taken, equal to DB and the ordinate EC be drawn, then the rectangle under the two ordinates shall be equal to the square of the first abscissa let the equation of the curve be \\( y = \\psi x \\) then \\( AB = x \\), \\( DB = y = \\psi x \\), \\( AC = DB \\), and \\( EC = \\psi (AC) = \\psi (DB) = \\psi y = \\psi \\psi x \\)\n\nthe given condition is therefore\n\n\\[\n\\psi^2 x \\times \\psi x = x^3\n\\]\n\nmaking the usual substitution of \\( \\psi x = \\phi^{-1} f \\phi x \\) it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\phi^{-1} f^2 \\phi x \\times \\phi^{-1} f \\phi x = x^3\n\\]\n\nputting \\( \\phi^{-1} x \\) for \\( x \\) we have\n\n\\[\n\\phi^{-1} f^2 x \\times \\phi^{-1} f x = (\\phi^{-1} x)^3\n\\]\n\nAssume\n\n\\[\n\\phi^{-1} x = \\chi(x, fx, f^2 x)\n\\]\n\nthe equation then becomes\n\n\\[\n\\chi \\{ f^2 x, f^3 x, f^4 x \\} \\times \\chi \\{ fx, f^2 x, f^3 x \\} = [\\chi \\{ x, fx, f^2 x \\}]^3\n\\]\n\nIf now \\( f \\) be determined from the equation\n\n\\[\nf^3 x = x\n\\]\n\nwe have \\( f^4 x = fx \\), and the equation becomes identical, hence \\( \\phi^{-1} \\) and \\( f \\) being found, we may determine \\( \\psi \\).\n\nOne of the simplest curves which satisfies the equation is\n\n\\[\ny x^2 = a^3\n\\]\n\na line of the third order, the 69th in Newton's arrangement, its form is\nProblem XX.\n\nRequired the general solution of the equation\n\n\\[ F \\{ x, \\psi x, \\psi^2 \\alpha x, \\psi^3 \\beta x, \\ldots \\psi^n v x \\} = 0 \\]\n\nReduce this by Problem XVIII. to the form of\n\n\\[ F \\{ x, \\psi x, \\psi^2 x, \\ldots \\psi^n x \\} = 0 \\]\n\nin which shape it may be solved by the preceding problem.\n\nProblem XXI.\n\nGiven the equation\n\n\\[ F \\{ x, \\psi x, \\psi \\alpha (x, \\psi \\beta x) \\} = 0 \\]\n\nrequired its solution.\n\nAssume\n\n\\[ \\alpha (x, \\psi x) = \\phi_1 f \\phi x \\quad (a) \\]\n\nhence\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\alpha^{1,-1} (x, \\phi_1 f \\phi x) \\quad (b) \\]\n\nIn the left side of this equation, put for \\( x \\) the left side of (a)\n\nand in the right side, put instead of \\( x \\) the right side of (a) the result is\n\n\\[ \\psi \\alpha (x, \\psi x) = \\alpha^{1,-1} (\\phi_1 f \\phi x, \\phi_1 f^2 \\phi x) \\]\n\nsubstituting this in the original equation, the result is\n\n\\[ F \\{ x, \\alpha^{1,-1} (x, \\phi_1 f \\phi x), \\alpha^{1,-1} (\\phi_1 f \\phi x, \\phi_1 f^2 \\phi x) \\} = 0 \\]\n\nwhich by putting \\( \\phi_1 x \\) for \\( x \\) becomes\n\n\\[ F \\{ \\phi_1 x, \\alpha^{1,-1} (\\phi_1 x, \\phi_1 f x), \\alpha^{1,-1} (\\phi_1 f x, \\phi_1 f^2 x) \\} = 0 \\]\n\nthis being an equation of the first order relative to \\( \\phi_1 \\) may be solved as above.\n\nWith respect to the number of arbitrary functions which enter into the complete solution of functional equations of higher orders than the first, I have little at present to offer; the difficulty of the subject, and the wide extent of the enquiries\nto which it would lead, induce me to postpone it until I have more time for the consideration. The following remarks may suffice for the present to point out some of its difficulties and the mode of enquiry.\n\nIf\n\n\\[ \\psi x = f \\{ x, a, b, \\&c. \\} \\]  \n\n(1)\n\n\\[ \\psi^2 x = f \\{ x, a, b, \\&c. \\} \\]  \n\n(2)\n\n\\[ \\psi^3 x = f \\{ x, a, b, \\&c. \\} \\]  \n\n(3)\n\n\\&c. \\&c.\n\n\\[ \\psi^n x = f \\{ x, a, b, \\&c. \\} \\]  \n\n(n)\n\nFrom this by eliminating \\( n-1 \\) of the arbitrary constants \\( a, b, \\&c. \\) we have an equation of the form\n\n\\[ F \\{ x, \\psi x, \\psi^2 x, \\ldots \\psi^n x \\} = 0 \\]  \n\n(a)\n\nand it might possibly be concluded that equation (1) containing \\( n-1 \\) arbitrary constants is the general solution of this last equation: but this is by no means the case. In the first place between the two equations (1) and (2), more than one arbitrary constant may be eliminated, thus let\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\frac{a-x}{1-bx} \\]\n\nfrom which we find\n\n\\[ \\psi^2 x = x \\]\n\nthe two quantities \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) have been eliminated, and it is possible to select a value of \\( \\psi x \\), between which and \\( \\psi^2 x \\) an infinite number of arbitrary constants could be eliminated.\n\nBut waving this objection let us consider the case of (a) which is deduced from the elimination of \\( n-1 \\) arbitrary functions.\n\nWe have seen in Problem VI. that a function of the first\norder may satisfy any number of conditions (which are not contradictory) simultaneously; and there appears no reason for denying this property to those of higher orders.\n\nIf now we consider the symmetrical function\n\n\\[ \\chi \\{ x, \\psi x, \\psi^2 x, \\ldots \\psi^n x \\} \\]\n\nand if \\( \\psi^{v+1} x = x \\). It is evident this function will not change by the substitution of \\( \\psi x, \\psi^2 x, \\&c. \\) or \\( \\psi^n x \\)\n\nand consequently that a different function similarly constituted may be substituted for each of the arbitrary quantities \\( a, b, c, \\&c. \\) in (1) which is the solution of the equation\n\n\\[ F \\{ x, \\psi x, \\psi^2 x, \\ldots \\psi^n x \\} = 0 \\quad (a) \\]\n\nThe number denoted by \\( v \\) is arbitrary (it may, however, become determined from some particular circumstances of the equation (a).\n\nThus we have introduced into an equation of the \\( n \\)th order, an unlimited number of arbitrary functions, each of which contains the function whose determination was sought with all its different orders to an undefined extent.\n\nIf we take the particular case of\n\n\\[ \\psi x = a - x \\]\n\\[ \\psi^2 x = x \\]\n\n\\( v \\) must be unity, and a general solution is\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\chi \\{ x, \\psi x \\} - x \\]\n\ntaking another solution\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\frac{a-x}{1-bx}, \\quad \\psi^2 x = x \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\psi x = \\frac{\\chi(x, \\psi x) - x}{1-x \\chi(x, \\psi x)} \\]\n\nIf \\( \\psi^n x = x \\) \\( v = n - 1 \\), and supposing \\( \\psi x = f(x, a, b, \\&c.) \\)\n\nany particular solution we have for the general one\n\\[\n\\psi x = f \\left\\{ x, \\chi (x, \\psi x, \\ldots \\psi^{n-1} x), \\chi_1 (x, \\psi x, \\ldots \\psi^{n-1} x) &c. \\right\\}\n\\]\n\nfrom which equation of the \\(n-1\\)th degree \\(\\psi\\) must be found.\n\nWhen we apply these considerations to functional equations of many variables, other and even greater difficulties present themselves; the first step in that direction must be an improvement in the notation.\n\nSince the above was written, I have bestowed some attention on functional equations involving two or more variables, and I have met with considerable success: I am in possession of methods which give the general solution of equations of all orders, and even of those which contain symmetrical functions. I have also discovered a new and direct method of treating functional equations of the first order, and of any number of variables, and this new method I have applied to the solution of differential and even of partial differential functional equations.",
