Concerning Van Horne, he also refutes the above-mention'd Anastomoses between Arteries and Veins; then describes the Spermatick Arteries and Veines; the Pyramidal-Figure, they make, where they meet near the Testes, the direct and retrograde passage of the said Artery's through the Testes, and such a strange Anastomosis between the Spermatick Veines, that they represent a kind of rete mirabile most elegantly. He also will not admit the Testes to be Glandular, but affirms, (which is the same with the Doctrine of De Graaf) totam Testium molem nil esse aliud, quam congeriem minutissimorum funiculorum, habentium seriem continuatam, atque concavorum, pro seminis materia devehenda: adding, that if the greater Globe of the Epididymis be well examin'd, there will appear through its Membrane such anfractus and funiculorum gyri, as resemble those of the Brain. He holds triplicem materiam seminis, unam, qua venit à Testibus; alteram, qua à Vesiculis; tertiam, qua ex prostatis in Urethram propellitur. He deduceth from the wonderfulness of the Structure of the Penis, Tensionem ejus, & impetuosum seminis per eundem ejaculacionem.

After this, he intimates briefly the Observables in Partibus Genitalibus Mulierum, and among other things remarks (what was lately also noted out of Steno's Myologia, Numb. 32.p.628.) Muliebrum testes esse Ovario in Oviparis analogos, they containing perfect Eggs, full of Liquor, and encompassed with a skin of their own, whereof he affirms to have yet some by him, &c.
