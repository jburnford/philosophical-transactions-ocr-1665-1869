VI. Extract of a Letter from Stephen Williams, M. B. F. R. S. concerning the Viper-catchers, (mention'd in N° 443. of these Transactions) and the Efficacy of Oil of Olives in curing the Bite of Vipers.

Plymouth, July 2, 1735.

William Oliver, in Presence of several Gentlemen of the Faculty of Physick, suffer'd himself, on June 26, 1735. to be bit by a Female Viper; which being enraged, fix'd her Fangs in the middle Part of his Fore-finger. Blood soon issued out at the Wounds: But that the Poison might more strongly appear, the same Viper immediately bit a Pigeon in the Breast, which expired in less than half an Hour. Another Pigeon was also bit by the same Viper, which expired also, though not so soon as the first. Mr. Oliver immediately complain'd of an acute Pain in the wounded Part. It soon look'd red, then became of a livid Colour: His Finger swell'd to a great Size, and he could not bend it. Soon upon this his Hand also began to swell: He complain'd of Faintness, and Pains flying to his Arm, Shoulder, and Arm-pit. In half an Hour's Time from the Bite, we persuaded him to try his Specifick; which being applied, and strongly rubbed into the Part affected, procured him immediate Ease. His Pain lessen'd, his Finger became flexible, his Spirits seem'd more cheerful: The Specifick being several times repeated and applied, his Pains gradually diminish'd. The next Day, June 27, his Finger and Hand remain'd tumefied, but without
without Pain: The Skin began to appear yellow, and Pustles appear'd, like Bladders, on his Finger; which being prick'd, emitted a sanious Liquor. In two Days time all his Symptoms vanish'd, and he became perfectly well.

June 30, the Gentlemen of the Faculty met again, when we tried several Experiments on Puppies, Cats, and Pigeons; wherein we found the Efficacy of Mr. Oliver's Specifick, and gave the Company great Satisfaction. I therefore . . . . . recommend him to Lovers of Natural Philosophy, and such who study the Benefit of Mankind. I think he deserves Encouragement, that the Specifick may be more universally known.

VII. A Proposal for the Measurement of the Earth in Russia, read at a Meeting of the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersbourg, Jan. 21. 1737. by Mr Jos. Nic. de L'Isle, first Professor of Astronomy, and F.R.S. Translated from the French printed at St. Petersbourg, 1737. 4to. By T.S. M.D.: F.R.S.

Necessity, or the Exigencies of Geography and Navigation, put Mankind very early upon the Enterprize of measuring the Earth. For how is it possible to construct the Charts of each Kingdom or Empire, without setting down all the Places in their
