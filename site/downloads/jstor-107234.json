S. and Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin. Communicated by the Astronomer Royal.\n\nRead February 26, 1807.\n\nThe theorems relative to finite differences, given by M. Lagrange in the Berlin Memoirs for 1772, have much engaged the attention of mathematicians. M. Laplace has been particularly successful in his investigations respecting them; yet an important difficulty remained, to endeavour to surmount which is the principal object of this Paper. The theorems alluded to may be thus stated.\n\nLet \\( u \\) represent any function of \\( x \\). Let \\( x + h, x + 2h, x + 3h, \\&c. \\) be successive values of \\( x \\), and \\( u_1, u_2, u_3 \\&c. \\) corresponding successive values of \\( u \\). Let \\( \\Delta^n u \\) represent the first term of the \\( n \\)th order of differences of the quantities \\( u, u_1, u_2 \\&c. \\) And let also \\( S^n u \\) represent the first term of a series of quantities, of which the first term of the \\( n \\)th order of differences is \\( u \\). Then ( \\( e \\) representing the series \\( 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{1.2} + \\frac{1}{1.2.3} + \\&c. \\))\n\n\\[\n1. \\Delta^n u = (e^{\\frac{u}{x}} - 1)^n \\quad 2. S^n u = (e^{\\frac{u}{x}} - 1)^{-n}\n\\]\n\nprovided that in the expansion of \\( (e^{\\frac{u}{x}} - 1)^n, \\frac{u}{x}, \\frac{u}{x^2}, \\frac{u}{x^3} \\&c. \\) be substituted for\nDr. Brinkley's Investigation of the general Term, &c.\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}}\\right)^2, \\left(\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}}\\right)^3, \\text{ &c.}; \\text{ and provided that in the expansion of}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(e^{\\dot{x}b} - 1)^{-n}, \\text{ fl. } u\\dot{x}^n, \\text{ fl. } n^{-1} u\\dot{x}^{n-1}, \\text{ &c. be substituted for } \\left(\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}}\\right)^{-n},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}}\\right)^{-n+1} \\text{ &c. and } \\frac{2}{x^2}, \\frac{3}{x^3}, \\text{ &c. be substituted for } \\left(\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}}\\right)^2, \\left(\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}}\\right)^3, \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\n\nThese theorems, which M. Lagrange had not demonstrated except by induction, have since been accurately investigated in different ways by M. Laplace,* and also by M. Arbo gast†.\n\nThe expanded formula for \\( S^n u \\), or, more accurately speaking, the natural series for \\( S^n u \\) is of the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\alpha}{b^n} \\text{ fl. } u\\dot{x}^n + \\frac{\\beta}{b^{n-1}} \\text{ fl. } u\\dot{x}^{n-1} \\ldots \\frac{u}{b} \\text{ fl. } u\\dot{x} + nu + \\pi \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} h + \\rho \\frac{h}{x^2} h^2 + \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficients \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\text{ &c.} \\) are readily obtained by equations of relation, which were first given by Lagrange. But to complete the solution it is obviously necessary to obtain the law of progression, and be able to ascertain any coefficient independent of the preceding ones. This has not hitherto been done, as far as I know, except in the case of \\( n = 1 \\). M. Laplace has given a very ingenious investigation for that case.‡ This has been copied with just encomiums by M. Lacroix§ who does not mention that any one had accomplished it for any other value of \\( n \\). In this Paper the general term is given for any value of \\( n \\), the law of which is remarkably simple. A particular formula, remarkably simple as to its law, is also given for the case of \\( n = 1 \\), from which that of Laplace may be deduced.\n\n* Mém. Acad. Scien. 1777 and 1779.\n† Arbo gast du Calcul des Derivations, Art. 355, &c.\n‡ Mém. Acad. Scien. 1777.\n§ Lacroix Traité des Differences et des Series, Art. 918.\nIn the case of \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( h = 1 \\) the formula for \\( Su \\) is of the form \\( \\alpha \\cdot fl. u \\dot{x} + \\beta u + \\gamma \\frac{u}{x} + \\delta \\frac{u}{x^2} + \\&c. \\) and exhibits the sum of a series of which \\( u \\) any function of \\( x \\) is the general term. For which purpose it was first given by Euler in the VIth Vol. Com. Petropol. and afterwards demonstrated in the VIIIth Vol. of the same work. It has been differently investigated since by several authors.* But Laplace appears to have been the first who gave a general term for the coefficients. Euler seems to have sought it in vain, for he says \"Ipsa series coefficientum \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\&c. \\) ita est comparata ut vix credam \"pro ea terminum generalem posse exhiberi.\"\n\nAs preparatory to the main object of this enquiry it has been thought proper to give investigations of the above two theorems, which will probably be found as simple as any that have appeared. It has also been found necessary, for avoiding very complex formula, to adopt a peculiar notation, which requires some explanation.\n\n**Notation.**\n\nThe first term of the \\( n \\)th order of differences of the series \\( o^n, 1^n, 2^n, \\&c. \\) is denoted by \\( \\Delta^n o^n \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{x^n}{1.2.3..n} \\) is denoted by \\( \\frac{x^n}{n} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{1.2.3..n} \\) is denoted by \\( \\frac{\\dot{x}}{n} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{\\Delta^n o^n}{1.2.3..n.1.2.3..m} \\) is denoted by \\( \\Delta^n o^n \\)\n\nwhich omission of the denominators cannot produce any inconvenience, because the indices sufficiently point them out whether those indices refer to powers, fluxions, or differences.\n\n* Maclaurin's Fluxions, Vol. II. p. 672, &c.

Then by Taylor's theorem,\n\n\\[u_n = u + \\frac{u}{x} nh + \\frac{u}{x^2} n^2 h^2 + \\frac{u}{x^3} n^3 h^3 + &c. = u + e^{\\frac{u}{x} nb} - 1,\\] substituting as above-mentioned.

I.** \\( \\Delta^n u = \\left( e^{\\frac{u}{x} b} - 1 \\right)^n \\) making the necessary change after expansion. This change does not affect the numerical coefficients, which are evidently the same as those of \\( (e^b - 1)^n \\), and because \\( (e^b - 1)^n = h^n \\left( 1 + \\frac{b}{1.2} + \\frac{b^2}{1.2.3} + \\&c. \\right)^n \\) the theorem is manifest.\n\n**Theorem III.** The coefficient of \\( \\frac{n+m}{x^{n+m}} h^{n+m} = \\Delta^n o^{n+m} \\).\n\n**Dem.** The successive values of \\( u \\) are\n\n\\[ u, u + \\frac{u}{x} h + \\frac{u}{x^2} h^2 + \\&c., u + \\frac{u}{x} 2h + \\frac{u}{x^2} 2^2 h^2 + \\&c., u + \\frac{u}{x} 3h + \\frac{u}{x^2} 3^2 h^2 + \\&c. \\] and therefore (the whole \\( n \\)th differences being made up of the \\( n \\)th difference of the parts) we have\n\n\\[ \\Delta^n u = \\frac{u}{x} h \\Delta^n o + \\frac{u}{x^2} h^2 \\Delta^n o^2 + \\cdots \\frac{n+m}{x^{n+m}} h^{n+m} \\Delta^n o^{n+m} + \\&c. \\]\n\nwhere it is to be observed that whilst \\( n+m \\) is less than \\( n \\) \\( \\Delta^n o^{n+m} = 0 \\), and \\( \\Delta^n o^n = 1 \\), as is well known, and easily appears from **Theorem II.**\nTheorems relative to the inverse Method of finite Differences.\n\nTheorem IV.

It is a very simple example of a method of very extensive application with respect to analytical functions. The theorems for finding fluxions per saltum, communicated by me to the Royal Irish Academy, in November, 1798, and published\nLet the equation (2) be multiplied by \\( \\frac{x^n}{b^n} \\), and the \\( n \\)th fluent taken, and we have\n\n\\[\nS^n u = \\frac{\\alpha}{b^n} \\text{fl.}^n u \\dot{x}^n + \\frac{\\beta}{b^{n-1}} \\text{fl.}^{n-1} u \\dot{x}^{n-1} + \\ldots \\frac{\\mu}{b} \\text{fl.} u \\dot{x} + \\nu u + \\pi \\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} b + \\rho \\frac{\\ddot{u}}{\\dot{x}} h^2 &c.\n\\]\n\nAlso from the above value of \\( z \\), it is easy to see that the expansion of\n\n\\[\n\\left( e^{\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} h} - 1 \\right)^{-n} = \\frac{1}{h^n} \\left( \\frac{h}{e^{\\frac{\\dot{u}}{\\dot{x}} h} - 1} \\right)^n\n\\]\n\nin the seventh volume of their Transactions, furnish a general method of reducing any function of \\( x \\) to a series ascending by the powers of \\( x \\), and that either by assigning at once the coefficient of \\( x^n \\), or by equations of relation between the coefficients.\n\nBy the converse of that method we are enabled, either from the general coefficient, or from the equations of relation, to arrive at the primitive function. The converse, therefore, applies to the summation of series, to the investigation of the general term of a recurring series, and to several other important purposes. It is evident, that it applies to finding the general term of a recurring series, because from the given scale of relation, the primitive function can be deduced, and from the primitive function, the general coefficient may be determined. The same method extends to the reduction of any function of \\( x, y, z, &c. \\) and therefore the converse to finding the general term of double, triple, &c. recurring series.\n\nI had not considered the converse of the method of reduction of analytical functions afforded by my theorems for finding fluxions per saltum, till I had seen M. Arbogast's ingenious work, entitled \"Du Calcul des Derivations.\" As those theorems furnish every thing that is given in the former part of his treatise, and likewise admit of more extensive application; so also the converse of them serve for deducing, with greater facility, every thing respecting recurring series, &c. contained in the same Treatise.\n\nThe important uses to be derived from finding fluxions per saltum in the reduction of analytical functions, and from the converse, induced me to draw up a particular work on that subject. Its publication has hitherto been delayed by my unwillingness to offer a fluxional notation different from either that of Newton or Leibnitz, each of which is very inconvenient as far as regards the application of the theorems for finding fluxions per saltum.\n\nMDCCCVII.\nDr. Brinkley's Investigation of the general Term\n\n$$\\frac{\\alpha}{b^n} \\left( \\frac{u}{x} \\right)^{-n} + \\frac{\\beta}{b^{n-1}} \\left( \\frac{u}{x} \\right)^{-n+1} + \\cdots \\frac{\\mu}{b} \\left( \\frac{u}{x} \\right)^{-1} + nu + \\pi \\left( \\frac{u}{x} \\right) h + \\rho \\left( \\frac{u}{x} \\right)^2 h^2 + \\&c.$$  \n\nWhence the truth of the theorem is manifest.\n\n**Theorem V.** $S^n u = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{b^n} \\right) fl. n u \\dot{x}^n + \\frac{\\beta}{b^{n-1}} fl. n-1 u \\dot{x}^{n-1} + \\&c.$\n\nwhere the numerical coefficient of the $m + 1$ term is the coefficient of $h^m$ in the expansion of $\\left( 1 + \\frac{b}{1.2} + \\frac{b^2}{1.2.3} + \\&c. \\right)^{-n}$.\n\nThe demonstration of this is contained in that of the last theorem.\n\nPreviously to the investigation of the numerical coefficient of the general $m + 1$ term, it will be convenient to premise the following lemmas.\n\n**Lemma I.** Let $n$ represent any affirmative integral number, and $m$ any other affirmative integral number not greater than $n$.

Although the formula in the first corollary is, as to its formation and law of progression, very simple, yet one more simple may be readily obtained by the joint application of a transformation given by M. Laplace in his method, and of the first lemma above given; which formula and its investigation are here subjoined. This and the above general formule (\\( n \\) being any number), as well as the formula of Laplace (\\( n \\) being 1), do not enable us to compute the successive coefficients so readily as from the equations of relation. But this circumstance, it is imagined, will not render what has been here done less worthy of the notice of mathematicians.
