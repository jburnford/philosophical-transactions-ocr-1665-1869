III. The Lunar Eclipse, Oct. 11, 1772, observed at Canton. Communicated by John Blake, Esq. of Parliament-Street.

Redde, Nov. 4, 1772.

To John Blake, Esq. of Parliament-Street, Westminster.

MY DEAR FATHER,

Within an hour after I closed my letter to you, by this ship, enclosing Astronomical Observations from Pekin, I received the enclosed observation, of the late Eclipse, made by a Jesuit here. An accident prevented their sealing the packet for a few hours; and Mr. Hume is now waiting only for this letter of mine to finally dispatch.

Canton, Dec. 12, 1772.
per ship Osterley.

J. B. Blake.

I know nothing of the accuracy of the observation, as he is lately arrived here*.

* And the time being taken only by a watch regulated by the sun the day before, the observation is not much to be depended on. Nevil Maskelyne.

Observatio
Observatio Lunaris Eclipseos habita Cantone,
die 11 Octobris, 1772.

Observationem institui telescopio 6 palmarum:
tempus adnotavi ostentium ab horologio parvo
secundorum, spirâ, a mago Arnold Londinensi elab-
orato, quod in meridie vero antecedente correxi;
illius tamen fidelitatem examinare non potui in me-
ridie sequenti. Cælum erat omni ex parte limpi-
diffimum, et intentus expectabam penumbrae denfio-
ris adventum, quæ tamen valde tenuis apparuit,
ideoque initium non notavi.

Jam coeperat Eclipseis —— 10 54 26
Forsan 32'' citius fuisset.
Initium verum —— 10 53 54
Immersio —— 12 3 29
Medium. —— 12 58 59
Emercio —— 13 54 29
Finis —— 15 4 4
