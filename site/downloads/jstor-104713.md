Jo. Martyn M.D. to the President, concerning the same.

SIR,

Chelsea, Feb. 14, 1749-50.

Some time ago I troubled you with some Account of an Aurora Australis†, which I hope you receiv'd: I now take the Liberty to mention the Earthquake, which happen'd on Thursday last, of which you have without doubt had many and better Accounts from other Places.

It was felt here at 40' after Noon. All the Houses were violently shaken, especially those which are nearest to the River. I was sitting in my Study, which fronts the SW up one Pair of Stairs. I imagin'd that something heavy had failen down in the Room below me. The Servants, who happen'd to be dispersed in several Rooms, each of them thought one of the others had thrown down some heavy Chest or Cabinet. A Maid-Servant, who happen'd to be passing from one of the under Offices to another, felt the Ground shake under her. As the Place on which her Feet were was full 6 Feet below the Surface,

† See these Transactions, N. 494, p 3:9.
Surface, I immediately concluded, that such a Motion must be occasion'd only by an Earthquake.

However, as most of the Neighbours were confident that the Shock was occasion'd by the blowing up of the Powder-Mills at Hounslow, I dispatched a Messenger thither on Horseback, who brought me Word, that the Shock was not felt either there or at Brentford; and that he could not learn that it had been felt farther Westward than Kensington-Turnpike.

I have also since been inform'd, that it was felt at Fulham; but a Friend, who lives a little beyond Richmond, has sent me Word, that they did not feel it there.

Of those who were in the Street, or upon the River, some felt it, and others not.

I am credibly informed, that Letters from Calais and Boulogne mention its having been felt on that Coast.

It seems therefore to have extended itself far to the East; but to have terminated in the West, about two Miles beyond this Place. I am, Sir, with the greatest Respect,

Your most humble Servant,
J. Martyn.
