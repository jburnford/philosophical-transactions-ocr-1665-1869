On passing through Smithfield on Friday evening, the 26th of April last, between the hours of six and seven o'clock, my attention was arrested by a black spot, of the size of a crown piece, nearly in the centre of the sun, and which I watched with the naked eye for upwards of twenty minutes. There being a great quantity of vapour in the atmosphere at the time, permitted the eye to look at it with impunity.—J.D.R.
