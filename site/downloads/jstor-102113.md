Letter from Dr. Turbervile of Salisbury containing some considerable Observations in the Practice of Physic.

Sir!

I will now proceed in communicating more of my Observations to you; at present be pleas'd to accept these which follow.

I had a Gentlewoman my Patient, who was much troubled with the falling Sickness; in her Water I saw a great number of short Worms, full of legs, and like Millepedes: I gave her two or three purges, first with Pil: Agaric: & Rhubarb; but I still perceiv'd, in every Water was brought me, eight, or ten, or more, of the Worms; they appear'd lively, and full of Motion; and the fits continued daily: at last I gave Her half an ounce of Oxymel Helleboratum in Tansy Water; which wrought well and was successfull; so that she had a compleat cure. I shall leave you to judge of the cause of the Malady.

About six or seven years since, I had a Gentleman (Mr. Oyliff by name,) in cure of his Eye; which was as big as my fist, black, fleshy, and full of blewish bladders; this I judgd to be a Cancer: after purging, and bleeding, I cut out the ball, and ulcer'd flesh, by many Cuts, which were all insensible to Him, till I came to the Optic Nerve: at the last Cutt He complained, and bled a little; the Wound was heal'd in about a fortnight; He now wears a black patch over the place.

Not long after this, a young man (my Patient,) had an Eye as big as a Hen's Egg, very fair, without blemish, Rheum, or redness; and his sight was pretty tolerable; I judgd these Symptomes to proceed from thin humors fallen on the Eye, and Extending its Coats:
I cured this distemper by applying drying Medicines to the head, and Eyes, and making an Issue in Nucha, appello Morbum Oculum Bovinum, sive Oculi Hydropem: If these Observations are acceptable to you, you may command more of a like nature from.

Sarum

Dec. 10th

1684.

Your very humble Servant

Dawbeney Turberville.
