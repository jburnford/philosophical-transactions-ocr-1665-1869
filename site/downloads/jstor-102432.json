From the same Ingenious Person.\n\nSIR,\n\nI received this last Post from my worthily esteemed Friend Mr. Maurice Jones, Rector of Dol-Gelheu; the following Account of the burning of several Ricks of Hay and Houses, and also the Poisoning of the Grass, so as to render it Mortal to the Cattle that feed upon it, by a kindled Exhalation, or Ignis Fatuus. Be pleased to take it in his own words:\n\n'This Letter contains no Answer to your Queries about the Locusts, for I am wholly intent at present upon giving you the best Account I can of a most Dismal and Prodigious Accident at Harlech in this County the beginning of these Holy-days. It is of the unaccountable firing of Sixteen Ricks of Hay, and two Barns, whereof one was full of Corn, the other of Hay. I call it unaccountable, because 'tis evident they were not burnt by common Fire, but by a kindled Exhalation, which was often seen to come from the Sea. Of the duration whereof I cannot at present give you any certain Account, but am satisfied it lasted at least a Fortnight or three Weeks; and annoy'd the Country as well by Poisoning their Grass as Firing the Hay, for the space of a Mile, or thereabouts. Such as have seen the Fire, say, 'twas a blew weak Flames easily\neasily extinguish'd, and that it did not the least harm\nto any of the Men who interposed their Endeavours\nto save the Hay, though they ventured (perceiving it\ndifferent from common Fire) not only close to it, but\nsometimes into it. All the Damage sustained happen'd\nconstantly in the Night. I have enclosed a Catalogue\nof such as I have received certain Information of;\nand have nothing to add, but that there are three small\nTenements in the same Neighbour-hood (called Tydbin\nSiôn Wyn) whereof the Grais is so infected, that it ab-\nsolutely kills all manner of Cattle that feed upon it.\nThe Grais has been Infectious these three Years, but\nnot thoroughly Fatal till this last. Pray send me with\nall convenient speed your Friends Thoughts and your\nown, of the Causes, and if possible, also the Remedy\nof this surprizing Phenomenon, &c.\n\nDòl-Gelheu,\nJan. 20th. 1693.\n\nDecemb. 24th. 1693. Richard Griffith of Lechwedd-du,\nHumphrey Owen of Garreg-wenn, and Richard Davyd of\nErw-wenn, each of them lost a Rick of Hay the 24th.\nat Night.\n\nDecemb. 27th. 1693. That Night was burnt one Rick\nof Hay of John Philips of Inys Lanvihangel y Traethau,\ntwo Ricks of Hay of Griffith John Owen of Cefn Trevor-\nbach, and Katherine William, Widdow, of Cefn-Trevor-\nfawr, lost two Ricks.\n\nDecemb. 29th. 1693. That Night Francis Evans of\nGlas-vryn had one Rick burnt. Richard Davyd of Erw-\nwen, predict. had a Barn full of Hay of three Bayles of\nBuildings burnt down to the Ground.\n\nV. Part",
