I. The Extract of a Letter from Lisle in Flanders, May 25. N.S. 1686. giving an Account of an unusual Storm of Hail which fell there.

Here fell in this City Hail of so great a bigness, that the least exceeded Pigeons Eggs. Several of them were weighed, and were some a quarter of a Pound, others of a Pound Weight and more. One among the rest was observed to contain a dark brown matter in the middle thereof; and being thrown into the Fire, it gave a very great Report. Others were transparent, which melted before the Fire immediately. This Storm passed over the Citadel and Town, and left not a whole Glass in the Windows on the windward side. The Trees were broken, and some beat down, and the Partridges and Hares killed in abundance.
