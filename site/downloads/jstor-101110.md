from wolves, instead of which there would be a consociation, if there were a sympathy betwixt them. Where a particular Example being recited of a Wolf keeping and defending sheep; the thing is attributed to their being bred and fed together, and not to any natural Love.

Concerning the fifth, 'tis here affirmed, that there are Fishes under ground and in mines where waters are found, which may either be naturally met with amongst earth, or conveyed thither by various accidents, inundation of rivers, absorption of rivers, earthquakes, &c. Where some relations are inserted of odd things found under ground; as of a whole ship fit to sail in the Sea, found A. 1594. near Maestrich under a sandy hillock; and of another very old ship, found by mine-men A. 1462. not far from Bern in Helvetia under ground, together with its hempen sails and anchors, &c.; as also store of Pine-trees, found in the Pecle orderly placed under the Earth, which else grow in raised ground.

Touching the Sixth, viz. the Casting of Horns by Staggs, 'tis here distinguished, that Castrated Staggs do not cast their Horns, but Entire ones do; yet not so, as that these latter are by good experience known to cast them every year, though it be generally said and believed that they do so; whereas in the mean time 'tis commonly held, that every year in the first six years some addition is made to the branched Horns; unless that be to be understood of a greater number of branches growing every year, for so long a time, instead of the lesser number cast off.

Of this Casting, the Cause is also here inquired, some adscribing it to such a cause, as maketh Leaves fall from Trees, by reason of the want of a glutinous moisture; others imputing it to their too great Hardness, hindring the diffusion of the copious affluent blood, out of which, being gathered about Autumn, worms in time are bred, which gnawing and thereby exciting the itch make the animal rub off its horns against some Tree; others refer it to both, as our Author.

Lastly, or Falling Stars, vulgarly so called, they being in truth nothing but a Meteor: touching which this Author discusseth several Questions; as, How it comes to pass, that at times the True Star, under which the trajection happens, doth not presently appear? Whether those Trajections of Stars do also happen in the day time? Why those Stars when they fly through the Air, seem to represent a long course? why the motion of Falling Stars is slower at the latter end? &c.
