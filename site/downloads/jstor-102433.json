S. giving an Account of an extraordinary Hemorrhagia at the Glandula Lachrymalis.\n\nSIR,\n\nSince my coming to this place I have met with a very strange Case. An Icterial discontented Woman having a desire to dye, wholly rejected the help of Medicine, and within three Months being well nigh her end, there happened an Eruption of Blood out of the Glandula Lachrymalis of one of her Eyes, without any External Injury: There was an Evacuation of this of Blood within the space of Thirty Hours. About a Week after the same Sluce was opened again, and she bled till she dyed. Now, I would fain know what Blood-Vessels come to that Gland, from which such a vast quantity of Blood should be cast forth in so short a time.\n\nVI. A Letter from Richard Townley, of Townley in Lancashire, Esq; containing Observations on the Quantity of Rain falling Monthly, for several Years successively: Communicated to the Royal Society.\n\nTownley, Jan. 9. 1692.\n\nSIR,\n\nI Have now compleated this last Year's Observations, which I was very desirous should accompany the others I now also send you; and I hope you will be pleased",
