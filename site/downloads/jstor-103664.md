IV. The Description of an Aurora Borealis mention'd in the foregoing Letter.

My LORD,

About Seven 'o Clock at Night I was told that the Meteor call'd by our Sailors, Merry Dancers, was visible, and very bright. Having seen several before, but had no opportunity of being particular in my Observation, I went out into the open Air, clear of Houses, that I might have a better view all round the Horizon; from whose Northern part arose several Streams of Light, as if from behind a black Cloud. They were very many, and I believe, there was no possibility of numbering them, their Motion being so quick, shooting upwards to the Zenith with a Motion not be follow'd by the Eye. They had also another Motion which seemed to be side-ways, their higher Ends terminating sometimes in a sharp Point, sometimes in two or three Points; they appeared from the North-West to North-East; but were brightest in the North. Their Colour was pale like that of Jupiter through a Telescope, but not near so bright. Most of 'em reach'd the Zenith, where mixing with one another, they whisk'd round and form'd an Appearance like the curling Flame of a Glass-House-Fire; they had a very irregular Motion, sometimes turning inwards, sometimes outwards, like the Pendulum-Spring of a Watch. This circular Light was the brightest, and seem'd to occupy near ten Degrees of the highest part of the Hemisphere: Several Strokes of Light seem'd to dart from it to the South; but
but died before they got any considerable distance. In
the West, I saw two small long Clouds, which interposed
betwixt me and the light Streams; which I saw a-
bove the Clouds, and betwixt them, which convinc'd
me that this Light (whatever it be) is far above them.
I have drawn a Scheme of the whole Horizon, as it
appear'd to me. (See the Figure.) That bright Star is
Jupiter, whose Place then was 17° in Aries, and was
about South-West, I guess about 20° high. Some
of the brightest Stars in Taurus, Orion, and Aries ap-
pear'd South and South East; but I have not placed
those but by guess. In this state I left it: But was
told by one that saw it after Ten o' Clock, that the
whirling Light in the Zenith appeared of several Co-
lours, as, blue, green, yellow, and reddish. But that
I did not see.

I am, &c.

V. A Letter from the Reverend Mr. Edmund
Barrel, Rector of Sutton near Dartford in
Kent, to Sir Hans Sloane, Baronet, concern-
ing a Shock of an Earthquake felt in that
Neighbourhood, &c.

SIR,

Sutton, Aug. 11th, 1727.

I had an Information brought to me Yesterday, on
purpose to be communicated to your Society;
'twas, that the Earthquake was felt very sensibly at a
Farm on a Hill called Skeat-Hill, which is at the West
End of Lullingstone-Park, belonging to Percival Hart,
Esq;
