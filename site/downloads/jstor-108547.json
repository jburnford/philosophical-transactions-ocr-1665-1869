James Booth, LL.D., F.R.S. &c.\n\nReceived November 17, 1851,—Read January 22, 1852.\n\nSection I.\n\nI. In placing before the Royal Society the following researches on the geometrical types of elliptic integrals, which nearly complete my investigations on this interesting subject, I may be permitted briefly to advert to what had already been effected in this department of geometrical research. Legendre, to whom this important branch of mathematical science owes so much, devised a plane curve, whose rectification might be effected by an elliptic integral of the first order. Since that time many other geometers have followed his example, in contriving similar curves, to represent, either by their quadrature or rectification, elliptic functions. Of those who have been most successful in devising curves which should possess the required properties, may be mentioned M. Gudermann, M. Verhulst of Brussels, and M. Serret of Paris. These geometers however have succeeded in deriving from those curves scarcely any of the properties of elliptic integrals, even the most elementary. This barrenness in results was doubtless owing to the very artificial character of the genesis of those curves, devised, as they were, solely to satisfy one condition only of the general problem*.\n\nIn 1841 a step was taken in the right direction. MM. Catalan and Gudermann, in the journals of Liouville and Crelle, showed how the arcs of spherical conic sections might be represented by elliptic integrals of the third order and circular form. They did not, however, extend their investigations to the case of elliptic integrals of the third order and logarithmic form; nor even to that of the first order. These cases still remained, without any analogous geometrical representative, a blemish to the theory.\n\nSome years ago, when engaged in the discussion of the problem of the rotation of a rigid body round a fixed point, by the help of an auxiliary ellipsoid, I had continually brought under my notice, in the course of my investigations, the sections of a sphere by a concentric cone, or as they now are generally named, spherical conic\n\n* Legendre a cherché à représenter en général, la fonction dig. (c, ϕ) par un arc de courbe; mais ses tentatives ne nous ont pas semblé heureuses, car il n’est parvenu à résoudre complètement le problème, qu’en employant une courbe transcendante, dans laquelle l’amplitude ϕ et l’arcs ont entre eux une relation géométrique encore plus difficile à saisir que dans la lemniscate.—Verhulst, Traité des Fonctions Elliptiques, p. 295.\nsections. It accordingly became necessary that I should give especial attention to the nature of those curves. I succeeded in showing that the elliptic integral of the first order, which is merely a particular case of the circular form of elliptic integrals of the third order, represents a spherical conic section whose principal arcs have a certain relation to each other. Besides, I was so fortunate as to hit upon the true geometrical representative of an elliptic integral of the third order and logarithmic form. I discovered it to be the curve of intersection of a right elliptic cylinder by a paraboloid of revolution having its axis coincident with that of the cylinder. These researches were published in the early part of the present year*. There still remained, without investigation, the case when the parameter is negative and greater than 1. The geometrical representative of this peculiar form, I announced to be a curve, which I called the Logarithmic hyperbola. In the Theory of Elliptic Integrals, p. 159, I have said, \"If a right cylinder standing on a plane hyperbola as a base, be substituted for the elliptic cylinder, the curve of intersection may be named the logarithmic hyperbola. It will have four infinite branches, whose asymptots will be the infinite arcs of two equal plane parabolas. This curve, and not the spherical ellipse, is the true analogue of the common hyperbola.\" No demonstration, however, of these properties was given in that treatise.\n\nThe main object of the following paper is to prove, that Elliptic Integrals of every order, the parameter taking any value whatever between positive and negative infinity, represent the intersections of surfaces of the second order.\n\nTo these curves may be given the appropriate name of Hyperconic sections.\n\nThese surfaces divide themselves into two classes, of which the sphere and the paraboloid of revolution are the respective types; from the one arise the circular functions, from the other the logarithmic and exponential. The circular integral of the third order is derived from the sphere, while the logarithmic function of the same order is founded on the paraboloid of revolution.\n\nAlthough in the following pages I have, for the sake of simplicity, derived the properties of those curves, or of the integrals which represent them, from the intersections of these normal surfaces,—the sphere and the paraboloid,—with certain cylindrical surfaces; yet the intersections so produced may be considered as the intersections of these normal surfaces with various other surfaces of the second order. Let $U=0$ be the equation of the sphere or paraboloid, and $V=0$ the equation of the cylinder. The simultaneous equations $U=0$, $V=0$ give the equations of the curve of intersection. Let $f$ be any abstract number whatever; then $U+fV=0$ is the equation of another surface of the second order passing through the curve of intersection. Let $U=0$ be the equation of a sphere, for example. Accordingly as we assign suitable values to the number $f$, we may make the equation $U+fV=0$ represent any central surface of the second order. But we cannot, by any substitution or\n\n* The Theory of Elliptic Integrals, and the Properties of Surfaces of the Second Order, applied to the investigation of the motion of a body round a fixed point. London: G. Bell, 1851.\nrational transformation, make the equation $U + fV = 0$ represent a non-central surface instead of a central one, or vice versa.\n\nAlthough a remarkable relation exists between the areas and lengths of some of these hyperconics, such as the circle and the spherical ellipse, yet more distinctly to show the analogy which pervades all those curves, I have not had recourse in any case to the method of \"elliptic quadratures,\" as it is termed*. We cannot admit such a violation of the law of geometrical continuity as to suppose, that while a function in one state represents a curve line, in another, immediately succeeding, it must express an area. Such can only be taken as a conventional explanation, until the real one, characterized by the simplicity of truth, shall present itself.\n\nIn the course of these investigations, it will be shown that the formulæ for the comparison of elliptic integrals, which are given by Legendre and other writers on this subject, follow simply as geometrical inferences from the fundamental properties of those curves; and that the ordinary conic sections are merely particular cases of those more general curves above referred to, under the name of hyperconic sections.\n\nIt will doubtless appear not a little singular, that the principal properties of those functions, their classification, their transformations, the comparison of integrals of the third order, with conjugate or reciprocal parameters, were all investigated and developed before geometers had any idea of the true geometrical origin of those functions. It is as if the formulæ of trigonometry had been derived from an algebraical definition, before the geometrical conception of the circle had been admitted. As trigonometry may be defined, the development of the properties of circular arcs, whether described on a plane or on the surface of a sphere; so this higher trigonometry, or the theory of elliptic integrals, may best be interpreted as the development of the relations which exist between the arcs of hyperconic sections.\n\nIndeed it may with truth be asserted, that nearly all the principal functions, on which the resources of analysis have chiefly been exhausted, whether they be circular, logarithmic, exponential or elliptic, arise out of the solution of this one general problem, to determine the length of an arc of a hyperconic section.\n\nIt may be said, we cannot by this method derive any properties of elliptic integrals which may not algebraically be deduced from the fundamental expressions appropriately assumed. But surely no one will assert that the properties of curve lines should be algebraically developed, without any reference to their geometrical types.\n\nWe might from algebraical expressions suitably chosen, derive every known property of curve lines, without having in any instance a conception of the geometrical types\n\n* En considérant les fonctions elliptiques comme des secteurs, dont l'angle est précisément égal à l'amplitude $\\phi$, nous avons en l'avantage de justifier la dénomination d'amplitude appliquée à l'angle $\\phi$; et même celle de fonctions elliptiques, en général, puisque les courbes algébriques par lesquelles nous avons représentés ces transcendantes, se construisent avec facilité au moyen des rayons vecteurs d'une ou de deux ellipses données.\n\n—Verhulst, Traité des Fonctions Elliptiques, p. 295.\nwhich they represent. The theory of elliptic integrals was developed by a method\nthe inverse of that pursued in establishing the formulæ of common trigonometry. In\nthe latter case, the geometrical type was given—the circle—to determine the alge-\nbraical relations of its arcs. In the theory of elliptic integrals, the relations of the\narcs of unknown curves are given, to determine the curves themselves. This is\nbriefly the object of the present paper.\n\nThe true geometrical basis of this theory would doubtless long since have been\ndeveloped, had not geometers sought to discover the types of those functions among\nplane curves. They were beguiled into this course by observing, that in one case—\nthat of the second order—the representative curve is obviously a plane ellipse. Hence\nthey were led by a seeming analogy to search for the types of the other integrals\namong plane curves also.\n\nThe author hopes in a future communication to the Royal Society, the present\nhaving grown under his hands beyond the limits he anticipated, to extend his re-\nsearches to elliptic integrals with imaginary parameters, and to show the true\ngeometrical meaning of such expressions. It has long been known, that, by the aid\nof the imaginary transformation $\\sin \\phi = \\sqrt{-1} \\tan \\psi$, we may pass from the loga-\nrithmic to the circular type, and conversely; but it has not, however, been observed\nthat this transformation enables us to effect this transition, because it changes the\nalgebraic expression for the arc of a parabola into that for a circular arc or area,\nand conversely. The striking analogies developed between the formulæ of the\ntrigonometry of the circle and that of the parabola will be found very curious and\ninstructive.\n\nI have attempted thus to place on its true geometrical basis, a somewhat abstruse\ndepartment of analysis, and to clear up the elementary notions from which it may,\nwith the utmost simplicity, be developed. It is only in the maturity of a science,\nthat the relations which bind together its cardinal ideas become simplified. An\nauthor, who has himself contributed much to the progress of mathematical science,\nwell observes,—\"qui il est bien rare qu'une théorie sorte sous sa forme la plus simple\ndes mains de son premier auteur. Nous pensons qu'on sert peut-être plus encore la\nscience en simplifiant, de la sorte, des théories déjà connues, qu'en l'enrichissant de\nthéories nouvelles, et c'est là un sujet auquel on ne saurait s'appliquer avec trop de\nsoin.\"—Gergonne, Annales des Mathématiques, tom. xix. p. 338.\n\nII. I have ventured to make some alterations in the established notation of elliptic\nintegrals. I have written $i$ for the modulus, instead of $c$; and $j$ for its complement\ninstead of $b$; so that $i^2 + j^2 = 1$.\n\nThe symbol $c$, used by writers on this subject to designate the modulus, was\nadopted by analogy from the formula for the rectification of a plane elliptic arc by\nan integral of the second order. Although in the circular forms of the third order\nit still signifies a certain ellipticity, yet it has no longer the same signification in the\nusual form of the first order, or in the logarithmic form of the third.\nInstead of the usual symbol, $\\Delta = \\sqrt{1 - c^2 \\sin^2 \\phi} = \\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}$, $\\sqrt{I}$ has been substituted, when $i$ is the modulus. Should it become necessary to designate the amplitude, the expression may be written $\\sqrt{I_\\phi}$ or $\\sqrt{\\phi I}$.\n\nFor the elliptic integrals of the first and second orders, which are usually written $F_c(\\phi)$ and $E_c(\\phi)$, I have substituted $\\int \\frac{d\\phi}{\\sqrt{I}}$ and $\\int d\\phi \\sqrt{I}$. The surface of revolution may be named the generating surface, while the intersecting surface is always a cylindrical surface. The parameter, of which $p$ is the general symbol, we shall suppose to vary from positive to negative infinity, and to pass through all intermediate states of magnitude.\n\nThe nature of the representative curve will depend on the value assigned to the parameter $p$ in the expression $K \\int \\left[ \\pm p \\sin^2 \\phi \\right] \\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}$. The modulus we shall assume to be invariable and less than 1. In this progress from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, the parameter passes through thirteen distinct values, each of which will cause a variation in the species or properties of the hyperconic section, the representative curve of the given elliptic integral.\n\nIn the following Table we may observe that the generating surface in passing from a sphere to a paraboloid, in its state of transition, becomes a plane.\n\nIt is somewhat remarkable, that the common form of the elliptic integral of the first order does not appear in the Table, although it is implicitly contained in cases II. and VIII.; for in the circular form of the third order, when the parameter is equal to the modulus $i$, we can reduce the third order to the first. The reason why the first form of elliptic integral does not appear in the Table is this; in the thirteen cases given, the origin is placed at the centre, or symmetrically with respect to the represented curve. When the elliptic integral of the first order is given in the usual form, without a parameter, it represents a spherical parabola, but the origin is non-symmetrical, that is, the origin is placed at a focus. See Theory of Elliptical Integrals, p. 33.\n\nInstead of $p$, the general symbol for the parameter, we may substitute for it particular values, such as $l$, $m$, or $n$, as the case may require. The quantities $l$, $m$, $n$, $i$ and $j$, are connected by the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ni^2 + j^2 &= 1, & lm &= i^2, & m - n + mn &= i^2, & \\text{in the circular form}, \\\\\ni^2 + j^2 &= 1, & ln &= i^2, & m + n - mn &= i^2, & \\text{in the logarithmic form},\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n(1.)\n\n$m$ and $n$ may be called conjugate parameters; while $l$ and $m$, or $l$ and $n$ may be termed reciprocal parameters.\n\nThese thirteen cases are exhibited in the following Table.\n### TABLE\n\n| Case | Sign | Parameter | Generating surface | Cylindrical surface | Hyperconic section |\n|------|------|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| I    | +    | $p=n=\\infty$ | Sphere ............... | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Circular sections of elliptic cylinder. |\n| II   | +    | $p=n=i$, or $m=n$. | Sphere ............... | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Spherical parabola. |\n| III  | +    | $p=n>0$ | Sphere ............... | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Spherical ellipse. |\n| IV   | ±    | $p=n=0$ | Plane ............... | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Plane ellipse. |\n| V    | −    | $p=m=1-\\sqrt{1-i^2}$, or $m=n$. | Paraboloid indefinitely attenuated. | Circular cylinder ....... | Circular logarithmic ellipse. |\n| VI   | −    | $p=m$, or $p=n<i^2$ | Paraboloid ............. | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Logarithmic ellipse. |\n| VII  | −    | $p=m=i^2$ | Plane ............... | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Plane ellipse. |\n| VIII | −    | $p=m=i$ | Sphere ............... | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Spherical parabola. |\n| IX   | −    | $p=m>i^2$, $p=m<1$. | Sphere ............... | Elliptic cylinder ....... | Spherical ellipse. |\n| X    | −    | $p=l=1$ | Plane ............... | Hyperbolic cylinder ... | Plane hyperbola. |\n| XI   | −    | $p=l>1$ | Paraboloid ............ | Hyperbolic cylinder ... | Logarithmic hyperbola. |\n| XII  | −    | $p=l=1+\\sqrt{1-i^2}$, or $m=n$. | Paraboloid ............ | Hyperbolic cylinder. | Equiparametral logarithmic hyperbola. |\n| XIII | −    | $p=l=\\infty$ | Paraboloid ............ | Vertical plane .......... | Parabola. |\n\nCases I., IV., VII., X., XIII. give the formulæ for the rectification of the ordinary conic sections; the generating surface in these cases being a plane. When the generating surface is a sphere, we get the spherical hyperconic sections; when a paraboloid, the logarithmic hyperconic sections result.\n\n### Section II.—On the Spherical Ellipse.\n\nIII. A spherical ellipse may be defined as the curve of intersection of a cone of the second degree with a concentric sphere.\n\nIn the spherical ellipse there are two points analogous to the foci of the plane ellipse, such that the sum of the arcs of the great circles drawn from those points to any point on the curve is constant. Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be the principal semiangles of the cone; $2\\alpha$ and $2\\beta$ are therefore the principal arcs of the spherical ellipse. Let two right lines be drawn from the vertex of the cone in the plane of the angle $2\\alpha$, making with the internal axe of the cone equal angles $\\varepsilon$, such that\n\n$$\\cos \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\beta} \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (2.)$$\n\nThese lines are usually called foci, or the focal lines of the cone. The points in\nwhich they meet the surface of the sphere are termed the foci of the spherical ellipse.\n\nIV. Every umbilical surface of the second order has two concentric circular sections, whose planes, in the case of cones, pass through the greater of the external axes. Perpendiculars drawn to the planes of those sections, passing through the vertex,—they may be called the cyclic axes of the cone—make with the internal axis of the cone in the plane of $2\\beta$—the plane passing through the internal and the lesser external axis—equal angles $\\eta$, such that\n\n$$\\cos \\eta = \\frac{\\sin \\beta}{\\sin \\alpha}.$$  \n\nLet a series of planes be drawn through the vertex, and perpendicular to the successive sides of the cone. This series of planes will envelope a second cone, which usually is called the supplemental cone to the former. The cones are so related, that the planes of the circular sections of the one are perpendicular to the focals of the other, and conversely.\n\nV. The equation of the spherical ellipse may be found as follows, from simple geometrical considerations.\n\nLet $2\\alpha$ and $2\\beta$ be the greatest and least vertical angles of the cone; the origin of coordinates being placed at the common centre of the sphere and cone. Let the internal axis of the cone meet the surface of the sphere in the point $Z$, which may be taken as the pole. Let $\\rho$ be an arc of a great circle drawn from the point $Z$ to any point $Q$ on the curve. $\\psi$ being the angle which the plane of this circle makes with the plane of $2\\alpha$, we shall have for the polar equation of the spherical ellipse,\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\tan^2 \\rho} = \\frac{\\cos^2 \\psi}{\\tan^2 \\alpha} + \\frac{\\sin^2 \\psi}{\\tan^2 \\beta}.$$  \n\nTo show this, through the point $Z$ let a tangent plane be drawn to the sphere. This plane will intersect the cone in an ellipse. This ellipse may be called the plane base of the cone, while the portion of the surface of the sphere within the cone may be termed the spherical base of the cone. The plane of the great circle passing through $Z$ and $Q$ will cut the plane base of the cone in the radius vector $R$; and if we write $A$ and $B$ for the semiaxes of this ellipse, whose plane touches the sphere, we shall have, for the common polar equation of this ellipse, the centre being the pole,\n\n$$\\frac{1}{R^2} = \\frac{\\cos^2 \\psi}{A^2} + \\frac{\\sin^2 \\psi}{B^2}.$$  \n\nNow the radius of the sphere being $k$, and $\\rho$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, the angles subtended at the centre by $R$, $A$, $B$, we shall clearly have\n\n$$R = k \\tan \\rho, \\quad A = k \\tan \\alpha, \\quad B = k \\tan \\beta;$$  \n\nwhence\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\tan^2 \\rho} = \\frac{\\cos^2 \\psi}{\\tan^2 \\alpha} + \\frac{\\sin^2 \\psi}{\\tan^2 \\beta}.$$\nWe may write this equation in the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - \\sin^2 \\rho}{\\sin^2 \\rho} = \\frac{\\cos^2 \\psi}{\\sin^2 \\alpha}(1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha) + \\frac{\\sin^2 \\psi}{\\sin^2 \\beta}(1 - \\sin^2 \\beta);\n\\]\n\nor reducing,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\rho} = \\frac{\\cos^2 \\psi}{\\sin^2 \\alpha} + \\frac{\\sin^2 \\psi}{\\sin^2 \\beta}. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (6.)\n\\]\n\nThis is the equation of the spherical ellipse under another form, which may be obtained independently, by orthogonally projecting the spherical ellipse on the plane of the external axes; or by taking the spherical ellipse as the symmetrical intersection of a right elliptic cylinder with the sphere.\n\nVI. If in the major principal arc \\(2\\alpha\\) of the spherical ellipse, we assume two points equidistant from the centre, the distance \\(e\\) being determined by the condition\n\n\\[\n\\cos e = \\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\beta}, \\text{ as in (2.),}\n\\]\n\nthe sum of the arcs of the great circles drawn from these points—the foci—to any point on the spherical ellipse is constant, and equal to the principal arc \\(2\\alpha\\). For a proof of this well-known property, the reader is referred to the Theory of Elliptical Integrals, p. 12.\n\nVII. The product of the sines of the perpendicular arcs let fall from the foci of a spherical ellipse on the arc of a great circle touching it, is constant.\n\nLet \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) be the perpendicular arcs let fall from the foci on the tangent arc of a great circle; we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\sin w \\sin w' = \\sin(\\alpha + e) \\sin(\\alpha - e). \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (7.)^*\n\\]\n\nVIII. To find an expression for the length of a curve described on the surface of a sphere, whose radius is 1.\n\nLet \\(u\\) and \\(u'\\) be two consecutive points on the curve, \\(ZQ, ZQ'\\) the arcs of two great circles passing through them inclined to each other at the indefinitely small angle \\(d\\psi\\). Through \\(u\\) let a plane be drawn perpendicular to \\(OZ\\), and meeting the great circle \\(ZQ'\\) in \\(v\\).\n\nThen ultimately \\(uvu'\\) may be taken as a right-angled triangle, whence \\(uu'^2 = uv^2 + u'v^2\\).\n\nNow \\(uu' = d\\sigma, uv = \\sin \\rho \\, d\\psi, u'v = d\\rho\\), whence\n\n\\[\nd\\sigma = \\left[d\\rho^2 + \\sin^2 \\rho \\, d\\psi^2\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (8.)\n\\]\n\nIntegrating this expression between the limits \\(\\rho_1\\) and \\(\\rho_{\\mu}\\), or \\(\\psi\\) and 0, accordingly as we take \\(\\rho\\) or \\(\\psi\\) for the independent variable, we get\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\int_{\\rho_1}^{\\rho_{\\mu}} \\left[1 + \\sin^2 \\rho \\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{d\\rho}\\right)^2\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}; \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\sigma = \\int_{0}^{\\psi} \\left[\\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{d\\psi}\\right)^2 + \\sin^2 \\rho\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (9.)\n\\]\n\nIX.

We may derive from (6.) the following expressions,\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\psi = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\beta}{\\sin^2 \\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\beta}{\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\beta} \\right), \\quad \\cos^2 \\psi = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha}{\\sin^2 \\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\sin^2 \\rho - \\sin^2 \\beta}{\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\beta} \\right)\n\\]\n\nDifferentiating the former with respect to \\( \\psi \\) and \\( \\rho \\), and eliminating \\( \\sin \\psi, \\cos \\psi \\); using for this purpose the relations established in (10.), we find\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\psi}{d\\rho} = \\frac{-\\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\cos \\rho}{\\sin \\rho \\sqrt{\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\rho} \\sqrt{\\sin^2 \\rho - \\sin^2 \\beta}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this value of \\( \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\rho} \\) in the general expression for the arc; the resulting equation will become\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\int d\\varphi \\left[ \\frac{\\sin \\rho \\sqrt{\\cos^2 \\rho - \\cos^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta}}{\\sqrt{(\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\rho)(\\sin^2 \\rho - \\sin^2 \\beta)}} \\right]\n\\]\n\nan elliptic integral which may be reduced to the usual form by the following transformation: assume—\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 \\rho = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\varphi + \\sin^2 \\beta \\sin^2 \\varphi}{\\tan^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\varphi + \\tan^2 \\beta \\sin^2 \\varphi}\n\\]\n\nThe limits of integration are 0 and \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).

In the foregoing expressions (17.) and (28.) for the rectification of an arc of a spherical ellipse, the elliptic integrals are of the third order and circular form, with negative parameters. We shall now proceed to show that the same arc may be expressed by an elliptic integral of the third order and circular form, having a positive parameter.\n\nIt is shown in most elementary treatises on the integral calculus, in its application to the rectification of plane curves, that if \\(p\\) the perpendicular let fall from a fixed point as pole on a tangent to the curve, makes the angle \\(\\lambda\\) with a fixed right line drawn through the pole, \\(t\\) being the intercept of the tangent between the point of contact and the foot of the perpendicular, we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\pm s = \\int p d\\lambda + \\frac{dp}{d\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nand \\(t = -\\frac{dp}{d\\lambda}\\)\n\nThe signs of \\(s\\) to be taken as the curve is concave or convex to the pole.\n\nXII. To investigate an analogous formula for the rectification of a spherical curve, the intersection of a cone of any order with a concentric sphere.\n\nLet a point \\(Z\\) be assumed on the surface of the sphere as pole, and through this point a tangent plane \\(ZAQB\\), or \\((\\Theta)\\), to the sphere being drawn, the cone whose vertex is at \\(O\\), the centre of the sphere, and which passes through the given spherical curve, will cut this tangent plane \\((\\Theta)\\) in a plane curve \\(AQB\\), whose rectification may be effected, when possible, by (31.). Now a tangent plane \\(OQP\\), or \\((T)\\), may be conceived as drawn touching the cone, and cutting the tangent plane \\((\\Theta)\\) in a right line \\(QP\\) or \\(t\\), which will be a tangent to the plane curve \\(AQB\\) in \\((\\Theta)\\). It will also cut the sphere in an arc of a great circle \\((z\\omega)\\) which will touch the spherical curve in \\(z\\). Let the distance \\(QO\\) of the point of contact of the line \\(t\\) with the plane curve from the centre of the sphere be \\(R\\). Through the centre of the sphere let a plane \\(OZP\\), or \\((\\Pi)\\), be drawn at right angles to the straight line \\(t\\). Now this plane, as it is perpendicular to \\(t\\), must be perpendicular to the planes \\((\\Theta)\\) and \\((T)\\) which pass through \\(t\\). As the plane \\((\\Pi)\\) is perpendicular to the plane \\((\\Theta)\\), it must pass through \\((Z)\\) the point of contact of this plane with the sphere, and cut the plane...\nof the curve AQB in a right line ZP, or \\( p \\), which passes through the pole, the point of contact of (Θ) with the sphere. This line \\( p \\) being in (Π) must be perpendicular to \\( t \\). The plane (Π) will also cut the sphere in an arc of a great circle \\( Z\\sigma = \\varpi \\), perpendicular to \\( z\\varpi \\), the tangent arc to the spherical curve; for these arcs must be at right angles to each other, since the planes in which they lie, (Π) and (T), are at right angles. Let \\( P \\) be the distance OP of the point, in which the plane (Π) cuts the right line \\( t \\), from the centre of the sphere; \\( r \\) the distance \\( ZQ \\) of the pole of the plane curve to the point in which \\( t \\) touches it, \\( \\tau \\) being the angle which \\( t \\) subtends at the centre of the sphere, and \\( k \\) its radius,\n\n\\[\nR^2 = k^2 + r^2, \\quad P^2 = k^2 + p^2, \\quad t^2 = r^2 - p^2 = R^2 - P^2 \\\\\np = k \\sin \\varpi, \\quad t = P \\tan \\tau\n\\]\n\n\\( \\tau \\) is the angle between OQ and OP.\n\nLet \\( ds \\) be the element of an arc of the plane curve between any two consecutive positions of \\( R \\), indefinitely near to each other; \\( kd\\sigma \\) the corresponding element of the spherical curve between the same consecutive positions of \\( R \\). Then the areas of the elementary triangles on the surface of the cone, between these consecutive positions of \\( R \\), having their vertices at the centre of the sphere, and for bases the elements of the arcs of the plane and spherical curves respectively, are as their bases multiplied by their altitudes. Let \\( S \\) and \\( S' \\) be these areas; then\n\n\\[\nS : S' :: P \\frac{ds}{d\\lambda} : k^2 \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nBut the areas of triangles are also as the products of their sides into the sines of the contained angles, i.e. in this case as the squares of the sides, or\n\n\\[\nS : S' :: R^2 : k^2\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{P}{R^2} \\frac{ds}{d\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nputting for \\( ds \\) its value given in (31.), \\( \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{P}{R^2} \\left( \\frac{d^2 p}{d\\lambda^2} + p \\right) \\).\n\nNow \\( p = P \\sin \\varpi, \\quad P^2 = R^2 - t^2, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P^2 = k^2 + p^2 \\);\n\nwhence\n\n\\[\nP \\frac{dP}{d\\lambda} = p \\frac{dp}{d\\lambda}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = -\\frac{dp}{d\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these values in (d.), \\( \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\lambda} = \\sin \\varpi + \\frac{1}{R^2} \\left( P \\frac{d^2 p}{d\\lambda^2} - \\frac{dP}{d\\lambda} \\frac{dp}{d\\lambda} \\right) \\).\n\nWe now proceed to show that the last term of this equation is the differential of the arc, with respect to \\( \\lambda \\), subtended at the centre of the sphere.\n\nThis arc being \\( \\tau \\),\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\tau = \\frac{t}{P}, \\quad \\cos \\tau = \\frac{P}{R}\n\\]\n\\[ \\frac{d\\tau}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\left[ P \\frac{dt}{d\\lambda} - t \\frac{dP}{d\\lambda} \\right], \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad (f.) \\]\n\nor as\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{dp}{d\\lambda}, \\quad \\frac{d\\tau}{d\\lambda} = -\\frac{1}{R^3} \\left[ P \\frac{d^2p}{d\\lambda^2} - \\frac{dp}{d\\lambda} \\frac{dP}{d\\lambda} \\right]. \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad (g.) \\]\n\nAdding this equation to (e.), we get for the final result,\n\n\\[ \\pm \\sigma = \\int d\\lambda \\sin \\omega - \\tau. \\]\n\nIf \\( t = \\frac{dp}{d\\lambda} \\), the formula becomes\n\n\\[ \\pm \\sigma = \\int d\\lambda \\sin \\omega + \\tau. \\] \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad (33.)\n\nThroughout these pages, to avoid circumlocution and needless repetitions, we shall designate as the projected tangent, or briefly as the protangent, that portion of a tangent to a curve, whether it be a right line, a circle, or a parabola, between its point of contact, and a perpendicular from a fixed point let fall upon it, whether this perpendicular be a right line, or a circular, or a parabolic arc. This definition is the more necessary, as the protangent will continually occur in the following investigations. The term is not inappropriate, as the pro-tangent is the projection of the radius vector on the tangent.\n\nXIII.

These circular forms arise from treating the element of the spherical conic either as the hypotenuse of an infinitesimal right-angled triangle, or as an element of a circular arc, having the same curvature. When we adopt the former principle, we obtain for the arc an elliptic integral of the third order, circular form and negative parameter. When we choose the latter, we get a circular form of the same order, with a positive parameter. Equating these expressions for the same arc of the curve, the resulting relation is Legendre's theorem. We thus see how an elliptic integral with a positive parameter may be made to depend on another with a negative parameter less than 1 and greater than \\( i^2 \\).\n\nXVI.

Although we have called this curve the spherical parabola, as indicating its mode of generation, it is in fact a closed curve, like all other curves which are the intersections of cones of the second degree with concentric spheres. It is a spherical ellipse, and we shall now proceed to determine its principal arcs.\n\nLet ADG be a parabola, F its focus, O being the centre of the sphere which touches the plane of the parabola at F; and being also the vertex of the obtuse-angled cone, of which the parabola ADG is a section parallel to the side of the cone OB. Let the angle AOF or the arc Fa be \\( \\gamma \\), and \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) being the principal semiangles of the cone,\n\n\\[ 2\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\gamma = AOB, \\]\n\nwhence\n\n\\[ \\tan^2 \\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sin \\gamma}{1 - \\sin \\gamma}. \\]\n\nTo determine the angle \\( \\beta \\), or the arc Cb.

We thus obtain the following theorem:\n\nAny spherical conic section, the tangents of whose principal semiarcs can be the ordinates of an equilateral hyperbola, whose transverse semi-axis is 1, may be rectified by an elliptic integral of the first order.\n\nXXII. When we take the complete function, and integrate between the limits 0 and \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), we get, not the length of a quadrant of the spherical parabola, as we do when we take the centre as origin, but the length of two quadrants or half the ellipse. We derive also this other remarkable result, that when \\( \\mu \\) is a right angle, the spherical triangle whose sides are the radius vector, the perpendicular arc on the tangent, and the intercept of the tangent arc between the point of contact and the foot of the perpendicular, is a quadrantal equilateral triangle.

See Theory of Elliptic Integrals, p. 35.\n\nHence the spherical parabola is the envelope of a quadrantal arc of a great circle, which always has its extremities on two fixed great circles of the sphere, the angle between the planes of these circles being \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\gamma \\).\n\nResuming the equations given in (59.), which express the tangents of the principal semiarcs of the spherical parabola in terms of \\( \\sin \\gamma \\), namely,\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sin \\gamma}{1 - \\sin \\gamma}, \\quad \\tan^2 \\beta = \\frac{2 \\sin \\gamma}{1 - \\sin \\gamma},\n\\]\n\nwriting \\( i \\) for \\( \\cos \\gamma \\), and \\( j \\) for \\( \\sin \\gamma \\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\varepsilon = \\frac{1 - j}{1 + j}, \\quad e^2 = \\frac{1 - j}{1 + j}, \\quad \\sin^2 \\eta = \\left( \\frac{1 - j}{1 + j} \\right)^2,\n\\]\n\nwhence\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\varepsilon = e^2 = \\sin \\eta = \\cos^2 \\beta.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( n = \\tan^2 \\varepsilon, \\quad m = e^2; \\) hence \\( n = m = i. \\)\n\nXXIII. We shall now proceed to the rectification of an arc of the spherical parabola, the centre being the pole. By this method we shall obtain certain geometrical results which have hitherto appeared as mere analytical expressions.

This shows, that when the function is complete, or the amplitude is a right angle, the amplitude of the derived function will be two right angles.\n\nWhen the spherical parabola approximates to a great circle of the sphere, the second focus \\( F_i \\) will approach to \\( F \\) the immoveable focus. The arc \\( RF_i \\) will, therefore, approach to coincidence with the arc \\( RF \\), or the angle \\( \\nu \\) will approximate to \\( \\mu \\), so that \\( \\phi = \\mu + \\nu = 2\\mu \\) nearly.\n\nThis is the geometrical explanation of the analytical fact observed in this theory, that when the modulus diminishes, or the spherical parabola approximates to a great circle of the sphere, the ratio of any two successive amplitudes approximates to that of two to one.\n\nWhen the transverse arc of the spherical parabola is a right angle and a half, \\( \\sin \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), and if \\( C \\) be its circumference, \\( C = \\sqrt{2} \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^2 \\mu}} + \\pi \\). But two quadrants \\( 2s \\), or the loop of a lemniscate, are \\( = \\sqrt{2} \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^2 \\mu}} \\). Hence \\( 2s = C - \\pi \\).\nOr the loop of a lemniscate is equal to the difference between the circumference of the spherical parabola whose transverse arc is $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, and a semicircle.\n\nWhen a quadrant of the spherical parabola is taken, or when the point of contact $Q$ coincides with the extremity of the principal minor arc of the curve, we shall have $\\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSince in this case $RQ = PQ$, $FV = F'V$, therefore $\\mu = OFV = OF'_V$, or $RF_V = \\mu + \\nu$. As $V$ is the pole of $RP$, and $F'$ is the pole of $AR$, the point $R$ is the pole of $VF'$. Hence $RF'_V$ is a right angle, but $\\mu + \\nu = RF'_V$, whence $\\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. As $\\tan(\\varphi - \\mu) = j \\tan \\mu$, when $\\varphi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\tan \\mu = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}}$. If in the expression $\\tan \\tau = \\frac{j \\tan \\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\mu}}$ given in (58.), we substitute this value of $\\tan \\mu$, we shall get $\\tan \\tau = 1$, or $\\tau = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nHence as two quadrants of a spherical parabola are together double of one, we shall have, writing the integral $\\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\mu}}$ in the abbreviated form $\\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}}$,\n\n$$j \\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2j \\int_0^{\\tan^{-1}(j)} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}} = 2 \\int_0^{\\tan^{-1}(j)} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}}.$$  \n\n(68.)\n\nNow when $i$ is nearly 1, $\\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}} = \\log \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sin \\mu}{\\cos \\mu} \\right)$. Taking this expression between the limits $\\mu = 0$, and $\\mu = \\tan^{-1}(j)$, we shall have, since $\\sin \\mu = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + j^2}}$, $\\cos \\mu = \\frac{\\sqrt{j}}{\\sqrt{1 + j^2}}$, and neglecting $j$ and its powers when added to 1, $j$ being very small,\n\n$$\\frac{1 + \\sin \\mu}{\\cos \\mu} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{j}}, \\quad \\text{whence} \\quad \\int_0^{\\tan^{-1}(j)} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}} = \\log \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{j}} \\right).$$\n\nTherefore (68.) gives $\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}} = \\log \\left( \\frac{4}{j} \\right)$.  \n\n(69.)\n\nXXV.

The foregoing investigations furnish us with the geometrical interpretation of the transformations of Lagrange. Let the successive amplitudes $\\varphi$, $\\psi$, $\\chi$ of the derived functions, be connected by the equations\n\n$$\\tan(\\varphi - \\mu) = j \\tan \\mu, \\quad \\tan(\\psi - \\varphi) = j_i \\tan \\varphi, \\quad \\tan(\\chi - \\psi) = j_{ii} \\tan \\psi.$$  \n\n(97.)\n\nWe may imagine a series of confocal parabolas having a common axis, described on a plane in contact with a sphere at their common focus. These parabolas will generate a series of confocal spherical parabolas on the surface of the sphere, $BCA$, $BC'A'$, $BC''A''$, $BC'''A'''$, which will all mutually touch at the vertex $B$ remote from the common focus $F$. Let the distances between the common focus $F$ and the vertices of the plane parabolas subtend at the centre of the sphere, angles $\\gamma$, $\\gamma'$, $\\gamma''$, &c., whose cosines $i$, $i_i$, $i_{ii}$, &c. are connected by the equations\n\n$$i_j = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - i_j^2}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - i_j^2}}, \\quad i_{ii} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - i_{ii}^2}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - i_{ii}^2}}, \\quad i_{iii} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - i_{iii}^2}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - i_{iii}^2}}, \\ldots \\text{&c.}$$  \n\n(98.)\n\nIt is plain that $\\gamma = FA$, $\\gamma' = FA'$, $\\gamma'' = FA''$, $\\gamma''' = FA'''$, &c.\n\nWe may repeat this construction successively, until the parameter of the last of the applied tangent plane parabolas shall become so indefinitely small, compared with the radius of the sphere, that it may ultimately be taken to coincide with its projection. We shall in this way reduce, at least geometrically, the calculation of an elliptic integral of the first order to the rectification of an arc of a parabola, that is, to a logarithm, as in XX. If, on the contrary, the moduli $i$, $i_i$, $i_{ii}$, &c. proceed in a descending series, the angles $\\gamma$, $\\gamma'$, $\\gamma''$ continually increase, the magnitudes of the confocal applied parabolas increase, till at length their parameters become so large, compared with the radius of the sphere, that their central projections pass into great circles of the sphere. The evaluation of the elliptic integral will therefore ultimately be reduced to the rectification of a circular arc. These are the well-known results of the modular transformation of Lagrange.\n\nThe formulae established in (58.) for the rectification of the spherical parabola, give\n\n$$\\sigma = \\sin \\gamma \\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\gamma \\sin^2 \\mu}} + \\tan^{-1} \\left[ \\frac{\\sin \\gamma \\tan \\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\gamma \\sin \\mu}} \\right];$$\n\nor writing $i$ for $\\cos \\gamma$, $j$ for $\\sin \\gamma$, and $\\sqrt{I}$ for $\\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\mu}$,\n\n$$\\sigma - \\tau = j \\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{I}},$$\n\n$\\sigma'$ and $\\tau'$ being the corresponding quantities for the next derived spherical parabola,\n\n$$\\sigma' - \\tau' = j \\int \\frac{d\\varphi}{\\sqrt{I'}}.$$\nNow $j_i = \\frac{2\\sqrt{j}}{1+j}$, and $\\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{1-j^2}} = \\frac{1}{1+j} \\int d\\phi$, as in (98.) and (74.),  \nwhence $2(\\sigma-\\tau) = \\sqrt{j}(\\sigma'-\\tau')$.  \n\nThus a simple ratio exists between the arcs, diminished by the protangents, of two consecutive confocal spherical parabolas.\n\nWhen the functions are complete, $\\mu$ is taken between $0$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$; $\\phi$ therefore, as in article XXIV., must be taken between $0$ and $\\pi$; but when the amplitude is taken between $0$ and $\\pi$ the function is doubled. Moreover, when the functions are complete, the point $Q$ coincides with $B$; so that in this case the complete function represents, not one, but two quadrants of the spherical parabola, the focus being the pole. Hence as $\\tau = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\tau' = \\pi$.\n\nWhence putting $C, C', C'', C''', \\text{&c.}$ for the circumferences of the successive confocal spherical parabolas, derived by the preceding law, we may write\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nC - \\pi &= \\sqrt{j}(C_i - \\pi) \\\\\nC_i - \\pi &= \\sqrt{j_i}(C_{ii} - \\pi) \\\\\nC_{ii} - \\pi &= \\sqrt{j_{ii}}(C_{iii} - \\pi) \\\\\nC_{iii} - \\pi &= \\sqrt{j_{iii}}(C_{iv} - \\pi) \\\\\nC_{iv} - \\pi &= \\sqrt{j_{iv}}(C_v - \\pi)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nMultiplying successively by the square roots of $j_j, j_{ii}, j_{iii}, j_{iv}, \\text{&c.}$, adding and stopping at the fifth derived parabola,\n\n$$\nC - \\pi = \\sqrt{j_j j_{ii} j_{iii} j_{iv}} \\text{&c. } (C_v - \\pi).\n$$\n\nLet this coefficient be $\\sqrt{Q}$, and we shall have $C - \\pi = \\sqrt{Q}(C_v - \\pi)$.  \n\nNow we may extend this series, until the last of the derived spherical parabolas shall differ as little as we please from a great circle of the sphere. Let the circumference of this last derived spherical parabola be $C_v$.

It may not be out of place here to show, although the investigation more properly belongs to another part of the subject, that the arc of a spherical parabola may be represented as the sum of two elliptic integrals of the third order, having imaginary parameters; or in other words, that every elliptic integral of the first order may be exhibited as the sum of two elliptic integrals of the third order, having imaginary reciprocal parameters.\n\nAssume the expression given in (58.) for an arc of the spherical parabola, the focus being the pole, and \\( \\mu \\) the angle which the perpendicular arc from the focus, on the tangent arc of a great circle to the curve, makes with the principal transverse arc,\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sin \\gamma \\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\gamma \\sin^2 \\mu}} + \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\gamma \\tan \\mu}{\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\gamma \\sin^2 \\mu}} \\right).\n\\]\n\nLet \\( \\cos \\gamma = i, \\sin \\gamma = j \\), and to preserve uniformity in the notation, write \\( \\phi \\) for \\( \\mu \\).

In the preceding investigations the element of the curve has been taken as a side of a limiting rectilinear polygon inscribed within it.

XV.; will in the logarithmic ellipse be expressed by an arc of a parabola. As a parabolic arc can be rectified only by a logarithm, we may hence see the propriety of the term logarithmic, by which this function is designated.\n\nXXXIX. If from the vertex \\( A \\) of a paraboloid, an arc of a parabola be drawn, at right angles to a parabolic section of the paraboloid, it will meet this parabolic section at its vertex. Let the arc \\( AQ \\) be drawn at right angles to the parabolic section \\( Qv \\) of the paraboloid, the point \\( Q \\) is the vertex of the parabola \\( Qv \\).\n\nDraw \\( QT \\) and \\( Qt \\) tangents to the arcs \\( QA \\) and \\( Qv \\). Then \\( QT \\) and \\( Qt \\) are at right angles. As \\( QT \\) is a tangent to a principal section passing through the axis of the paraboloid, it will meet this axis in a point \\( T \\); and as \\( Qt \\) is a tangent to the surface of the paraboloid, it will be perpendicular to the normal to the surface \\( QN \\). Now as \\( Qt \\) is perpendicular to \\( QT \\) and to \\( QN \\), it is perpendicular to the plane \\( QTN \\) which passes through them, and therefore to every line in this plane, and therefore to the axis \\( AN \\), or to any line parallel to it, as the diameter \\( Qn \\). Hence, as the tangent \\( Qt \\) to the parabola \\( Qv \\) is perpendicular to the diameter \\( Qn \\), \\( Q \\) is the vertex of the parabola.\n\nHence in the logarithmic ellipse, one extremity of the protangent arc is always the vertex of the parabola which touches the logarithmic ellipse at its other extremity.\nThis is a very important theorem, as the protangents are arcs of equal parabolas, all measured from the vertices of the parabolas. Hence also the length of the protangent arc depends solely on its normal angle.\n\nAs an arc of a circle may be expressed by the notation \\( s = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right) \\), \\( y \\) being the ordinate and \\( k \\) the radius, so in like manner an arc of a parabola may be designated by the form \\( s = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right) \\); \\( y \\) being the ordinate and \\( k \\) the semiparameter. To distinguish the parabolic arc from the circular arc, the former may be written \\( s = \\tau \\omega^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right) \\). Again, as we say, in the case of the circle, the angle \\( \\omega \\) and the arc \\( k\\omega \\), \\( \\omega \\) being the angle contained between the normals to the curve at the extremities of the arc; so in the parabola, we may write \\( \\omega \\) for the angle between the normals, and \\( (k.\\omega) \\) for the corresponding parabolic arc. In the case of the parabola the arc is always supposed to be measured from the vertex; in the circle the arc may be measured from any point, as every point is a vertex.\n\nXL.

We naturally should suppose that the section of a cylinder which indefinitely approaches in its limit to a circular cylinder, by a paraboloid of revolution, would be a circle; yet the fact is not so. The intersection of these surfaces, instead of being a circle, is a logarithmic ellipse, whose rectification may be effected by an elliptic integral of the second order, as we shall now proceed to show.\n\nIn the first place let us conceive the paraboloid as of definite magnitude, and the cylinder to be elliptical; its semiaxes as before being \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).

The parameters are reciprocal in this equation, being 1 and \\( i^2 \\).\n\nNow this is the extreme case of the formula for the comparison of elliptic integrals of the third order and logarithmic form. We perceive that this formula results from the comparison of two expressions for the same arc of a common hyperbola. We may also see that it is the limiting case of the general formula for the comparison of elliptic integrals of the third order having reciprocal parameters; a formula which in like manner has been deduced from the comparison of two expressions for the same arc of the logarithmic hyperbola. It is also evident that \\( j^2 \\frac{\\tan \\phi}{\\sqrt{I}} \\) being the difference between \\( \\tan \\phi \\sqrt{I} \\) and \\( \\frac{i^2 \\sin \\phi \\cos \\phi}{\\sqrt{I}} \\), it is the difference between tangents, one drawn to the hyperbola, the other to the plane ellipse, for \\( \\tan \\phi \\sqrt{I} \\) denotes the portion of a tangent to a hyperbola between the point of contact and the perpendicular on it from the centre; and \\( \\frac{i^2 \\cos \\phi \\sin \\phi}{\\sqrt{I}} \\) denotes a similar quantity in an ellipse; this difference is precisely analogous to the expression which occurs in (284.) \\( \\int \\frac{du}{\\cos^3 u} - \\int \\frac{dr}{\\cos^3 r} \\), which denotes the difference between two parabolic arcs, one drawn a tangent to the logarithmic hyperbola, the other a tangent to the logarithmic ellipse.\n\nSection VII.—On the Values of complete Elliptic Integrals of the third order.\n\nLIII. We have hitherto investigated the properties and lengths of elliptic curves, on the supposition that the generating surface, whether sphere or paraboloid, was invariable, and that the lengths of the curves were made up by the summation of the elements produced by the successive values given to the amplitude \\( \\phi \\) between certain limits, 0 and \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), suppose, if the arcs are to be quadrants. Thus the length of the quadrant is obtained, by adding together the successive increments which result from the successive additions, indefinitely small, which are made to the amplitude. We may, however, proceed on another principle to effect the rectification of those curves. If, to fix our ideas, we want to determine the length of a quadrant of the spherical ellipse, we may imagine the vertical cylinder, which we shall suppose invariable, to be successively intersected by a series of all possible concentric spheres. Every quadrant will differ in length from the one immediately preceding it in the series, by an infinitesimal quantity; and if we take the least of these quadrants, and add to it the successive elements, by which one quadrant differs from the next immediately preceding, we shall thus obtain the length of a quadrant of the required spherical ellipse, equal to the least quadrant which can be described on the elliptic cylinder, plus the sum of all the elements between the least quadrant and the required one. Thus, for example, the least quadrant which can be drawn on an elliptic vertical cylinder, is its section by an horizontal plane, or a quadrant of the plane ellipse,\nwhose semiaxes are $a$ and $b$. In this case the radius of the sphere is infinite. The least sphere is that whose radius is $a$, and which cuts the cylinder in its circular sections. Hence the greatest spherical elliptic quadrant is the quadrant of the circle whose radius is $a$. All the spherical elliptic quadrants will therefore be comprised between the quadrants of an ellipse, and of a circle whose radius is $a$. Any quadrant therefore of a given spherical ellipse is equal to a quadrant of a plane ellipse, plus a certain increment; or to a quadrant of a circle, minus a certain decrement.\n\nThe same reasoning will hold as well when we take any other limits, besides 0 and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThese considerations naturally lead to the process of differentiation under the sign of integration, because we cannot express, under a finite known form, the arc of a spherical or logarithmic ellipse, and then differentiate the expression so found, with respect to a quantity which hitherto has been taken as a constant.\n\nWe may conceive the generation of successive curves of this kind to take place in another manner. Let us imagine an invariable sphere to be cut by a succession of concentric cylinders indefinitely near to each other, and generated after a given law. These cylinders will cut the sphere in a series of spherical ellipses, any one of which will differ from the one immediately preceding, by an indefinitely small quantity. If we sum all these indefinitely small quantities, or in other words, integrate the expression so found, we shall discover the finite difference between any two curves of the series separated by a finite interval. One of the limits being a known curve, the other may thus be determined.\n\nTo apply this reasoning.\n\nIn the following investigations we shall assume the generating sphere to be invariable, and the modulus $i$, with the amplitude $\\phi$ to be constant. The intersecting cylinder we shall suppose to vary from curve to curve on the surface of the sphere.\n\nBut $i$ is constant, and $i^2 = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2}$, see (27.). Now $a$ and $b$ being the semiaxes of the base of the cylinder, it follows that the bases of all the varying cylinders are concentric and similar ellipses. Hence in the elliptic integral of the third order, which represents the spherical ellipse, the parameter $e^2$ or $m$, and the criterion of sphericity $\\sqrt{x}$ will vary.\n\nIn (17.) we found for a quadrant of a spherical hyperconic section, the expression\n\n$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{d\\phi}{[1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\phi] \\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}}.$$  \n\nLet $k$ be the radius of the sphere.\n\nSince $e^2 = \\frac{k^2 i^2}{k^2 - j^2 a^2}$, $e$ will vary, as being a function of $a$ the transverse semiaxe of the variable cylinder.

In the logarithmic form of the elliptic integral, the formula for the comparison of elliptic integrals, with reciprocal parameters (one of which is greater, while the other is less than 1), resulted from putting in equation\ntwo algebraical expressions for the same arc of the one logarithmic hyperbola. See Art. XLVIII. In the preceding case, that of the spherical ellipse, the analogous formula expresses the sum of the arcs of two inverse spherical ellipses, whose amplitudes are the same.\n\nLV. We shall use the term *inverse spherical ellipses* to denote curves whose representative elliptic integrals have reciprocal parameters. The terms reciprocal and supplemental have long since been appropriated to curves otherwise related.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ denote the principal semiarcs of two such curves. Since the modulus $i$ is the same in both integrals, the orthogonal projections of these curves, on the base of the hemisphere, are similar ellipses. (15.) gives\n\n$$e^2 = i^2 \\sec^2 \\beta, \\quad e_i^2 = i^2 \\sec^2 \\beta_i,$$\n\nand we assume $e^2 e_i^2 = i^2$.

Now we have shown in (59.) that when the principal arcs of a spherical hyperconic section are so related, the curve is the spherical parabola, or when the curve becomes its own inverse, it is the spherical parabola.\n\nWe have shown in (15.) that $i^2 = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\beta}{\\sin^2 \\alpha}$, but (3.) gives $\\cos \\gamma = \\frac{\\sin \\beta}{\\sin \\alpha}$, $2\\eta$ being the angle between the cyclic arcs of the spherical ellipse. Hence $i = \\sin \\eta$, but $i$ is constant. Therefore all inverse spherical ellipses have the same cyclic arcs.\n\nThat portion of the surface of a sphere which lies between the cyclic circles may be called the *cyclic area*.\n\nThe spherical parabola divides the cyclic area into two regions. In the one, between the pole and the spherical parabola, lie all the inverse curves, whose parameters range from $i^2$ to $i$. In the other, between the spherical parabola and the cyclic circles, lie all the conjugate inverse curves, whose parameters range from $i$ to 1.\n\nLet $acb$, $adb$ be the cyclic circles, the intersection of the sphere by an elliptic cylinder, whose transverse axe is equal to the diameter of the sphere, and whose minor axe is $2j$. Let a series of concyclic spherical ellipses be described within this cyclic area, whose semi-transverse arcs are 01, 02, 04, 05, and let 03 be the spherical parabola of the series. For every curve, 01, or 02, within the spherical parabola, there may be found another without it,\n\nFig. 17.\n05, or 04, such that their principal arcs are connected by the equations\n\n\\[ \\tan \\alpha \\tan \\alpha_i = 1, \\quad \\sec \\beta \\sec \\beta_i = 1. \\]\n\nThe algebraic expressions for the arcs of these curves, having the same amplitude, give elliptic integrals with reciprocal parameters.\n\nThe concyclic spherical ellipses will be orthogonally projected on the base of the hemisphere into as many concentric and similar plane ellipses, whose semiaxes are 01, 02, 04, 05. The cyclic area will be projected into the plane ellipse, and the spherical parabola into the area of the plane ellipse, whose transverse semiaxe is \\( \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{1+i}} \\). Let E be the area of the plane ellipse, the projection of the cyclic area, and \\( \\Pi \\) the area of the plane ellipse, the projection of the spherical parabola.\n\nThen \\( E = \\pi j \\), and \\( \\Pi = \\frac{\\pi j}{1+i} \\), whence \\( \\frac{E - \\Pi}{\\Pi} = i \\), or the ellipse, the projection of the spherical parabola, divides the area of the ellipse, the projection of the cyclic area, into two portions, such that the outer is to the inner as \\( i : 1 \\).\n\nThe reader must have observed the importance of this curve, the spherical parabola, in the discussion of the geometrical theory of elliptic integrals.\n\nWe may determine the principal arcs of two inverse spherical ellipses by a simple geometrical construction. Let AZB be a vertical section of the hemisphere, on which the curves are to be described. Let F be the focus of the elliptic base of the maximum cylinder, whose principal transverse axis is accordingly equal to the diameter of the sphere. Join OZ, FZ, and draw ZC at right angles to ZF, meeting the line AO in C. Produce ZO until OD = AC, and on OD as diameter describe a circle. We are required, given one principal arc Za, to determine the corresponding principal arc Za' of the inverse hyperconic. Draw the tangent ZG. Through a draw\nthe line GOu. Through D draw the line DuG. Join OG, it will cut the sphere in \\(a\\), the vertex of the principal arc Za. Let OZ = \\(k\\), then ZG = \\(k \\tan \\alpha\\), and as CZF is a right-angled triangle, CO = ZD = \\(\\frac{k^2}{\\sqrt{k^2 - B^2}} = \\frac{k}{i}\\), \\(k\\) and \\(B\\) being the semiaxes of the maximum cylinder. As all the bases of the cylinders are similar, \\(\\frac{k^2 - B^2}{k^2} = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2} = i^2\\).\n\nNow as ZOG and ZDG' are similar triangles, ZG : ZO :: ZD : ZG', or \\(k \\tan \\alpha : k :: \\frac{k}{i} : ZG'\\), or \\(ZG' = \\frac{k}{i \\tan \\alpha}\\). But ZG' = \\(k \\tan \\alpha\\), hence \\(\\tan \\alpha \\tan \\alpha_i = 1\\), or the arcs \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\alpha_i\\) are connected by the equation established in (317.).\n\nWhen we require to know which of these successive curves on this sphere is the spherical parabola, the same construction will enable us to determine it. Draw ZT, a tangent to the circle on OD, take ZT' = ZT'' = ZT, and join T' and T'' with O cutting the sphere in c and c'. Zc = Ze' is the principal semitransverse arc of the spherical parabola, for \\(ZT'^2 = k^2 \\tan^2 \\alpha = OZ \\cdot ZD = \\frac{k^2}{i}\\), or \\(\\tan^2 \\alpha = \\frac{1}{i}\\).\n\nAs \\(ZT' > ZO\\), \\(cZc' > \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), or the principal arc of a spherical parabola is always greater than a right angle. Since in the spherical parabola \\(\\gamma + 2\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), the angle COT' = \\(2\\varepsilon\\), or COT' is equal to the distance between the foci of the curve.\n\nLVI. If we revert to the general formula (307.) and take \\(\\sigma\\) as the quadrant of a spherical parabola, the integrations with respect to \\(\\theta\\) must take place between \\(\\theta = 0\\), and \\(\\theta_i = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{i}}\\right)\\), for \\(e^2 = i\\), in (300.) gives \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{i}}\\).

LIII. may be represented\nby two confocal spherical parabolas, having one common focus, and the nearer vertex of the one curve on the focus of the other. Thus let $F$ be the pole of the hemisphere $ABD$. Let $BCf'$ and $AC_f'$ denote two spherical parabolas having one common focus at $F$; $F'$ and $f'$ being the other foci.\n\nLet $Ef' = \\gamma$, and therefore $FF = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\gamma$.

The development of this expression is the foundation of circular trigonometry.\n\n**On the Trigonometry of the Parabola.**\n\nWhen the hyperconic section is a parabola, $i = 1$, and (338.) may be reduced to\n\n$$\\tan \\omega = \\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi + \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (339.)$$\n\nIf we make the imaginary transformations,\n\n$$\\tan \\omega = \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\omega', \\tan \\phi = \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\phi', \\tan \\chi = \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\chi', \\sec \\phi = \\cos \\phi', \\sec \\chi = \\cos \\chi'. \\quad (340.)$$\nThe preceding formula will become, on substituting these values, and dividing by $\\sqrt{-1}$,\n\n$$\\sin \\omega' = \\sin \\phi' \\cos \\chi' + \\sin \\chi' \\cos \\phi',$$\n\nthe well-known trigonometrical expression for the sine of the sum of two circular arcs.\n\nHence, by the aid of imaginary transformations, we may interchangeably permute the formulae of the trigonometry of the circle with those of the trigonometry of the parabola. In the trigonometry of the circle, $\\omega = \\phi + \\chi$, and in the trigonometry of the parabola $\\omega$ is such a function of the angles $\\phi$ and $\\chi$, as will render $\\tan[(\\phi, \\chi)] = \\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi + \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi$. We must adopt some appropriate notation to represent this function. Let the function $(\\phi, \\chi)$ be written $\\phi \\pm \\chi$, so that $\\tan(\\phi \\pm \\chi) = \\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi + \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi$. This must be taken as the definition of the function $\\phi \\pm \\chi$.\n\nIn like manner, we may represent by $\\tan(\\phi \\mp \\chi)$ the function $\\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi - \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi$.\n\nIn applying the imaginary transformations, or while $\\tan \\phi$ is changed into $\\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\phi$, $\\sec \\phi$ into $\\cos \\phi$, and $\\cot \\phi$ into $-\\sqrt{-1} \\cosec \\phi$, $\\pm$ must be changed into $+$ and $-$ into $-$. $\\pm$ and $-$ may be called logarithmic plus and minus. As examples of the analogy which exists between the trigonometry of the parabola and that of the circle, we give the following expressions in parallel columns; premising that the formulæ, marked by corresponding letters, may be derived singly, one from the other, by the help of the preceding imaginary transformations.\n\n**Trigonometry of the Parabola.**\n\n| Formula | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| $\\tan(\\phi \\pm \\chi) = \\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi \\pm \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi.$ | (a.) |\n| $\\tan(\\phi \\mp \\chi) = \\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi \\mp \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi.$ | (b.) |\n| $\\sec(\\phi \\pm \\chi) = \\sec \\phi \\sec \\chi \\pm \\tan \\phi \\tan \\chi.$ | (c.) |\n| $\\sin(\\phi \\pm \\chi) = \\frac{\\sin \\phi + \\sin \\chi}{1 + \\sin \\phi \\sin \\chi}.$ | (d.) |\n| $\\sin(\\phi \\mp \\chi) = \\frac{\\sin \\phi - \\sin \\chi}{1 - \\sin \\phi \\sin \\chi}.$ | (e.) |\n\nLet $\\phi = \\chi$.\n\n| Formula | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| $\\tan(\\phi \\pm \\phi) = 2 \\tan \\phi \\sec \\phi.$ | (f.) |\n| $\\sec(\\phi \\pm \\phi) = \\sec^2 \\phi + \\tan^2 \\phi.$ | (g.) |\n| $\\sin(\\phi \\pm \\phi) = \\frac{2 \\sin \\phi}{1 + \\sin^2 \\phi}.$ | (h.) |\n| $\\sec \\phi = \\frac{e^{\\int \\cos \\phi} + e^{-\\int \\cos \\phi}}{2}, \\tan \\phi = \\frac{e^{\\int \\cos \\phi} - e^{-\\int \\cos \\phi}}{2}.$ | (i.) |\n| $1 + \\sqrt{-1} \\tan(\\phi \\pm \\phi) = (\\sec \\phi + \\sqrt{-1} \\tan \\phi)^2.$ | (j.) |\n| $\\tan^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\sec(\\phi \\pm \\phi) - 1}{2}.$ | (k.) |\n\nLet the amplitudes be $\\phi \\pm \\chi$ and $\\phi \\mp \\chi$.\n\n| Formula | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| $\\tan(\\phi \\pm \\chi) \\tan(\\phi \\mp \\chi) = \\tan^2 \\phi - \\tan^2 \\chi.$ | (l.) |\n\n**Trigonometry of the Circle.**\n\n| Formula | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| $\\sin(\\phi + \\chi) = \\sin \\phi \\cos \\chi + \\sin \\chi \\cos \\phi.$ | (a.) |\n| $\\sin(\\phi - \\chi) = \\sin \\phi \\cos \\chi - \\sin \\chi \\cos \\phi.$ | (b.) |\n| $\\cos(\\phi \\pm \\chi) = \\cos \\phi \\cos \\chi \\mp \\sin \\phi \\sin \\chi.$ | (c.) |\n| $\\tan(\\phi + \\chi) = \\frac{\\tan \\phi + \\tan \\chi}{1 - \\tan \\phi \\tan \\chi}.$ | (d.) |\n| $\\tan(\\phi - \\chi) = \\frac{\\tan \\phi - \\tan \\chi}{1 + \\tan \\phi \\tan \\chi}.$ | (e.) |\n\nLet $\\phi = \\chi$.\n\n| Formula | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| $\\sin 2\\phi = 2 \\sin \\phi \\cos \\phi.$ | (f.) |\n| $\\cos 2\\phi = \\cos^2 \\phi - \\sin^2 \\phi.$ | (g.) |\n| $\\tan 2\\phi = \\frac{2 \\tan \\phi}{1 - \\tan^2 \\phi}.$ | (h.) |\n| $\\cos \\phi = \\frac{e^{\\phi \\sqrt{-1}} + e^{-\\phi \\sqrt{-1}}}{2}, \\sin \\phi = \\frac{e^{\\phi \\sqrt{-1}} - e^{-\\phi \\sqrt{-1}}}{2 \\sqrt{-1}}.$ | (i.) |\n| $1 + \\sin 2\\phi = (\\cos \\phi + \\sin \\phi)^2.$ | (j.) |\n| $\\sin^2 \\phi = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\phi}{2}.$ | (k.) |\n\nLet the amplitudes be $\\phi + \\chi$ and $\\phi - \\chi$.\n\n| Formula | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| $\\sin(\\phi + \\chi) \\sin(\\phi - \\chi) = \\sin^2 \\phi - \\sin^2 \\chi.$ | (l.) |\nSince \\[ \\sec(\\phi + \\phi) = \\sec^2\\phi + \\tan^2\\phi, \\text{ and } \\tan(\\phi + \\phi) = 2\\tan\\phi \\sec\\phi, \\]\n\\[ \\sec(\\phi + \\phi) + \\tan(\\phi + \\phi) = (\\sec\\phi + \\tan\\phi)^3. \\]\n\nAgain, as \\[ \\sec(\\phi + \\phi + \\phi) = \\sec(\\phi + \\phi) \\sec\\phi + \\tan(\\phi + \\phi) \\tan\\phi, \\]\nand \\[ \\tan(\\phi + \\phi + \\phi) = \\tan(\\phi + \\phi) \\sec\\phi + \\sec(\\phi + \\phi) \\tan\\phi, \\]\nit follows that \\[ \\sec(\\phi + \\phi + \\phi) + \\tan(\\phi + \\phi + \\phi) = (\\sec\\phi + \\tan\\phi)^3, \\]\nand so on to any number of angles.

Let \\( AB = (k, \\phi) \\), \\( AC = (k, \\chi) \\), \\( AD = (k, \\omega) \\) and \\( \\frac{yy'}{k^2} = h \\). Then (343.) shows that the parabolic arc \\( (AC + AB) = \\text{apsidal arc } AD - h \\); and the parabolic arc \\( (AD - AB) = BD = \\text{apsidal arc } AC + h \\). When the arcs \\( AC' \\), \\( AB' \\) together constitute a focal arc, or an arc whose cord passes through the focus, \\( \\phi + \\chi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), and \\( h \\) is the ordinate of the conjugate arc AD. Hence we derive this theorem,\n\nAny focal arc of a parabola is equal to the difference between the conjugate apsidal arc and its ordinate.\n\nThe relation between the amplitudes \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\omega \\) in this case is \\( \\sin 2\\phi = \\frac{2 \\cos \\omega}{1 - \\cos \\omega} \\). Thus when the focal cord makes an angle of \\( 30^\\circ \\) with the axis, we get \\( \\cos \\omega = \\frac{1}{5} \\), or \\( y = 5k \\).\n\nHere therefore the ordinate of the conjugate arc is five times the semiparameter.\n\nLX. We may, in all cases, represent by a simple geometrical construction, the ordinates of the conjugate parabolic arcs, whose amplitudes are \\( \\phi \\), \\( \\chi \\) and \\( \\omega \\).\n\nLet \\( ABC \\) be a parabola whose focus is \\( O \\), and whose vertex is \\( A \\). Let \\( AO = g = \\frac{k}{2} \\); moreover let \\( AB \\) be the arc whose amplitude is \\( \\phi \\), and \\( AC \\) the arc whose amplitude is \\( \\chi \\). At the points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\) draw tangents to the parabola, they will form a triangle circumscribing the parabola, whose sides represent the semi-ordinates of the conjugate arcs, \\( AB \\), \\( AC \\), \\( AD \\).\n\nWe know that the circle, circumscribing this triangle, passes through the focus of the parabola.\n\nNow \\( Ab = g \\tan \\phi \\), \\( Ac = g \\tan \\chi \\), \\( bd = g \\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi \\), \\( cd = g \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi \\); hence \\( bd + cd = g (\\tan \\phi \\sec \\chi + \\tan \\chi \\sec \\phi) \\), therefore \\( g \\tan \\omega = bd + cd \\).\n\nWhen \\( AB \\), \\( AC \\) together constitute a focal arc, the angle \\( bdc \\) is a right angle.\nThe diameter of this circle is \\( g \\sec \\phi \\sec \\chi \\).\n\nThe demonstration of these properties follows obviously from the figure.\n\nLXI. In the trigonometry of the circle, we find the formula\n\n\\[\n\\vartheta = \\tan \\vartheta - \\frac{\\tan^3 \\vartheta}{3} + \\frac{\\tan^5 \\vartheta}{5} - \\frac{\\tan^7 \\vartheta}{7} + \\ldots \\quad \\text{(a.)}\n\\]\n\nand if we develop, by common division, the expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta} = \\cos \\theta (1 + \\sin^2 \\theta + \\sin^4 \\theta + \\sin^6 \\theta + \\ldots) \\quad \\text{and integrate,}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\sin \\theta + \\frac{\\sin^3 \\theta}{3} + \\frac{\\sin^5 \\theta}{5} + \\frac{\\sin^7 \\theta}{7} + \\ldots \\quad \\text{(b.)}\n\\]\n\nIf we now inquire, what, in the circle, is the arc which differs from its protangent, by the distance between the vertex and its focus; or, as the protangent is 0 in the circle, and the focus is the centre; the question may be changed into what is the trigonometrical tangent of the arc of a circle equal to the radius. This question is answered by putting 1 for \\( \\vartheta \\) in (a.), and reverting the series\n\n\\[\n1 = \\tan(1) - \\frac{\\tan^3(1)}{3} + \\frac{\\tan^5(1)}{5} - \\frac{\\tan^7(1)}{7} + \\ldots \\quad \\text{&c.;}\n\\]\n\nwe should get, in functions of the numbers of Bernouilli, the value of \\( \\tan(1) \\), as is shown in most treatises on trigonometry.\n\nLet us now make a like inquiry in the case of the parabola, and ask what is the value of the amplitude which will give the difference, between the arc of the parabola and its protangent, equal to the distance between the focus and the vertex of the parabola. Now if \\( \\theta \\) be this angle, we must have \\((k.\\theta) - g \\sec \\theta \\tan \\theta = g\\). But in general, \\((k.\\theta) - g \\sec \\theta \\tan \\theta = g \\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\\). Hence we must have, in this case, \\(\\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = 1\\). If we now revert the series (b.), putting 1 for \\(\\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\\), we shall get from this particular value of the series,\n\n\\[\n1 = \\sin \\theta + \\frac{\\sin^3 \\theta}{3} + \\frac{\\sin^5 \\theta}{5} + \\frac{\\sin^7 \\theta}{7} + \\ldots \\quad \\text{&c.,}\n\\]\n\nan arithmetical value for \\( \\sin \\theta \\). This will be found to be, \\( \\sin \\theta = \\frac{e^1 - e^{-1}}{e^1 + e^{-1}} \\), \\( e \\) being the base of the Napierian logarithms. Hence \\( \\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta = e \\), or if we write \\( \\epsilon \\) for this particular value of \\( \\theta \\) to distinguish it from every other, and call it the angle of the base,\n\n\\[\n\\sec \\epsilon + \\tan \\epsilon = e \\quad \\text{(345.)}\n\\]\n\nWe are thus (for the first time it is believed) put in possession of the geometrical origin of that quantity, so familiarly known to mathematicians, the Napierian base. From the above equations we may derive\n\n\\[\n\\sec \\epsilon = \\frac{e^1 + e^{-1}}{2}, \\quad \\tan \\epsilon = \\frac{e^1 - e^{-1}}{2} \\quad \\text{(346.)}\n\\]\n\nor \\( \\tan \\epsilon = 1.175203015 \\), whence \\( \\epsilon = .8657606 \\), or \\( \\epsilon = 49^\\circ.36'.15'' \\).\n\nThe corresponding arc of the parabola will be \\((k.\\theta) = k \\left[ 1 + \\frac{21}{123} + \\frac{23}{12345} + \\ldots \\right] \\quad \\text{(347.)} \\)\nIf we assume the theory of logarithms as known, we may at once arrive at this value, for in general\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\log (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta); \\]\n\nand as this is to be 1, we must have \\( \\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta = e \\), as before.\n\nLXII. If we now extend this inquiry, and ask, what is the magnitude of the amplitude of the arc of the parabola which shall render the difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent equal to \\( n \\) times the distance between the focus and the vertex; we shall have, as before, by the terms of the question,\n\n\\[ (k.\\theta) - g \\sec \\theta \\tan \\theta = ng . . . . . . . . (348.) \\]\n\nBut in general\n\n\\[ (k.\\theta) - g \\sec \\theta \\tan \\theta = g \\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta}; \\]\n\nhence we must have\n\n\\[ n = \\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\log (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta), \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ \\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta = e^n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . (349.) \\]\n\nNow we may solve this equation in two ways; either by making \\( n \\) a given number, and then determine the value of \\( \\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta \\), which may be called the base. Or we may assign an arbitrary value to \\( \\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta \\), and then derive the value of \\( n \\).\n\nTaking the latter course, let, for example,\n\n\\[ \\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta = 10. \\text{ Then } n = \\log_{10}, \\]\n\nor \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) is the modulus of the second system of logarithms. Hence, if we assume any number of systems of logarithms on the same parabola, and take their bases\n\n\\[ g(\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta), \\quad g(\\sec \\theta' + \\tan \\theta'), \\quad g(\\sec \\theta'' + \\tan \\theta''), \\ldots &c., \\]\n\nthe moduli of these successive systems will be the ratios of half the semiparameter to the successive differences between the base parabolic arcs and their protangents.\n\nIn the Napierian system, \\( g \\) the distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola, is taken as 1. The difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent, when equal to \\( g \\), gives \\( g(\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta) = eg \\). In the decimal system \\( g(\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta) = 10g \\), and the difference between the corresponding parabolic arc and its protangent being \\( ng \\), if we make this difference \\( ng \\) equal to the arithmetical unit, we shall have \\( ng = 1 \\), or \\( g = \\frac{1}{n} = \\text{modulus of the system} \\). Hence in every system of logarithms whatever, \\( g \\)\n\nthe distance between the focus and the vertex of the parabola, is the modulus of the system. Every system of logarithms may be derived from the same parabola, but the Napierian system, in which the focal distance of the vertex is itself taken as the unit, may justly be taken as the natural system. In the same way we may consider that to be the natural system of circular trigonometry, in which the radius is taken as the unit. The modulus, in the trigonometry of the parabola, corresponds with the radius in the trigonometry of the circle. But while in the trigonometry of the parabola the base is real, in the circle it is imaginary. In the parabola, the angle of the base is given by the equation \\( \\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta = e \\). In the circle \\( \\cos \\theta + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\theta = e^{\\sqrt{-1}} \\), and\nmaking $\\vartheta = 1$, we get $\\cos(1) + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin(1) = e^{\\sqrt{-1}}$. Hence while $e^1$ is the *parabolic* base, $e^{\\sqrt{-1}}$ is the *circular* base. Or as $[\\sec \\epsilon + \\tan \\epsilon]$ is the Napierian base, $[\\cos(1) + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin(1)]$ is the *circular* or imaginary base. Thus\n\n$$[\\cos(1) + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin(1)]^\\vartheta = \\cos \\vartheta + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\vartheta.$$\n\nHence, speaking more precisely, imaginary numbers have real logarithms, but an imaginary base. We may always pass from the real logarithms of the parabola, to the imaginary logarithms of the circle, by changing $\\tan \\theta$ into $\\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\vartheta$, $\\sec \\theta$ into $\\cos \\vartheta$, and $e^1$ into $e^{\\sqrt{-1}}$.\n\nAs in the parabola the angle $\\theta$ is non-periodic, its limit being $\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, while in the circle $\\vartheta$ has no limit, it follows that while a number can have only one real or *parabolic* logarithm, it may have innumerable imaginary or *circular* logarithms.\n\nIn the parabola we thus can show the geometrical origin of the magnitudes known as the base and the modulus. We might too form systems of circular trigonometry analogous to different systems of logarithms. We might refer the arc of a circle not to the radius, but to some other arbitrary fixed line, the diameter or any other suppose. Let the circumference be referred to the diameter, then $\\pi$ will signify a whole circumference instead of a semicircle, and $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ will represent a right angle. Having on this system, or any similar one, found the lengths of the arcs which correspond to certain functions, such as given sines or tangents, we should multiply the results by some fixed number, which we might call a modulus (2 in this example), to reduce them to the standard system; but such systems would obviously be useless.\n\nIf $\\epsilon$ be the angle which gives the difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent equal to $g = \\frac{k}{2}$; $(\\epsilon - \\epsilon)$ is the angle which will give this difference equal to $2g$, $(\\epsilon - \\epsilon - \\epsilon)$ is the angle which will give this difference equal to $3g$, and so on to any number of angles. Hence, in the circle, if $\\vartheta$ be the angle which gives the circular arc equal to the radius, $2\\vartheta$ is the angle which will give an arc equal to twice the radius, and so on for any number of angles. This is of course self-evident in the case of the circle, but it is instructive to point out the complete analogy which holds in the trigonometries of the circle and of the parabola.\n\n**LXIII.** The geometrical origin of the exponential theorem may thus be shown.\n\nAssume two known logarithmic bases $(\\sec \\alpha + \\tan \\alpha)$, and $(\\sec \\beta + \\tan \\beta)$, and let us investigate the ratio of the differences of the corresponding parabolic arcs and their protangents.\n\nLet $\\sec \\epsilon + \\tan \\epsilon$ be the Napierian base, and let one difference be $xg$ and the other $yg$.\n\nThe ratio of these differences is therefore $\\frac{y}{x} = z$, if we make $y = xz$. Hence\n\n$$\\sec \\alpha + \\tan \\alpha = (\\sec \\epsilon + \\tan \\epsilon)^x = e^x,$$ and $(\\sec \\beta + \\tan \\beta) = e^y$. Therefore\n\n$$(\\sec \\alpha + \\tan \\alpha)^y = e^{x+y} = (\\sec \\beta + \\tan \\beta)^x.$$ \n\nOr, as $y = xz$,\n\n$$(\\sec \\alpha + \\tan \\alpha)^z = \\sec \\beta + \\tan \\beta.$$\nLet $A$ be the first base, and $B$ the second. Then $B = A^y$. This is the exponential theorem.\n\nLet $A$ be the Napierian base, then $x = 1$, and $A = e$. Hence $B = e^y$.\n\nLXIV. Given the number to find its logarithm, may be exhibited by the following geometrical construction.\n\nLet OAP be a parabola. Through the focus $O$ draw the perpendicular $OQ$ to the axis $AO$. Through $A$ let a tangent of indefinite length be drawn. On this tangent take the line $AN$ to represent the given number. Join $NO$, and make the angle $NOT$ always equal to the angle $NOQ$. Draw $TP$ at right angles to $TO$. This line will touch the parabola in the point $P$, and the arc of the parabola $AP - PT$ will be the logarithm of $AN$.\n\nWhen $AN' = AO =$ the unit $g$, the angle $N'OQ$ is equal to half a right angle. Hence the point $T$ in this case will coincide with $A$. The parabolic arc therefore vanishes, or the logarithm of 1 is 0. When $\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta = 1$, $\\theta = 0$.\n\nWhen the number is less than 1, the point $N$ will fall below $N'$ in the position $n$. Hence $nOQ$ is greater than half a right angle. Therefore $T$ will fall below the axis in the point $T'$; and if we draw through $T'$ a tangent $T'p$, it will give the negative arc of the parabola $T'p$, corresponding to the number $An$. Fractional numbers, or numbers between $+1$ and 0, must therefore be represented by the expression $g(\\sec \\theta - \\tan \\theta)$, since $\\tan \\theta$ changes its sign.\n\nWhen the number is 0, $n$ coincides with $A$, and the angle $NOQ$ in this case is a right angle. Therefore the point $T'$ will be the intersection of $AT'$ and $OQ$. Hence $T'$ is at an infinite distance below the axis, and therefore the logarithm of $+0$ is $-\\infty$.\n\nHence negative numbers have no logarithms, at least no real ones; and imaginary ones can only be educed by the transformation so often referred to, and this leads us to seek them among the properties of the circle. For as $\\theta$ always lies between 0 and a right angle, or between 0 and the half of $\\pm \\pi$, $\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta$ is always positive; hence negative numbers can have no real or parabolic logarithms, but they may have imaginary or circular logarithms; for in the expression $\\log (\\cos \\theta + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\theta) = \\Im \\sqrt{-1}$, we may make $\\Im = (2n + 1)\\pi$, and we shall get $\\log (-1) = (2n + 1)\\pi \\sqrt{-1}$.\n\nHence also, as the length of the parabolic arc $TP$, without reference to the sign, depends solely on the amplitude $\\theta$, it follows that the logarithm of $\\sec \\theta - \\tan \\theta$ is equal to the logarithm of $\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta$. As $(\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta)(\\sec \\theta - \\tan \\theta) = 1$, we may hence infer, that the logarithm of any number is equal to the logarithm of its reciprocal, with the sign changed.\n\nWhen $\\theta$ is very large, $\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta = 2 \\tan \\theta$, nearly. Hence if we represent a large number by an ordinate of a parabola whose focal distance to the vertex is 1, the difference between the corresponding arc and its protangent will represent its logarithm.\n\nAlong the tangent to the vertex of the parabola, as in the preceding figure, draw,\nmeasured from the vertex, a series of lines in geometrical progression,\n\n\\[ g (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta), \\quad g (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta)^2, \\quad g (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta)^3, \\ldots \\ldots \\quad g (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta)^n. \\]\n\nJoin \\( N \\), the general representative of the extremities of these right lines, with the focus \\( O \\). Erect the perpendicular \\( OQ \\), and make the angle NOT always equal to the angle \\( NOQ \\). The line \\( OT \\) will be \\( = g \\sec \\theta \\), the line \\( OT_i = g \\sec (\\theta + \\theta) \\), the line \\( OT_{ii} = g \\sec (\\theta + \\theta + \\theta) \\), &c., and we shall likewise have\n\n\\[ AT = g \\tan \\theta, \\quad AT_i = g \\tan (\\theta + \\theta), \\quad AT_{ii} = g \\tan (\\theta + \\theta + \\theta), \\quad \\text{&c.} \\]\n\nThis follows immediately from (342.); for any integral power of \\( (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta) \\) may be exhibited as a linear function of \\( \\sec \\Theta + \\tan \\Theta \\), if \\( \\Theta = \\theta + \\theta + \\theta \\ldots \\&c. \\),\n\nsince \\( \\sec (\\theta + \\theta + \\theta + \\theta \\&c. \\text{to } n\\theta) + \\tan (\\theta + \\theta + \\theta + \\theta \\&c. \\text{to } n\\theta) = (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta)^n. \\)\n\nHence the parabola enables us to give a graphical construction for the angle \\( (\\theta + \\theta + \\&c.) \\) as the circle does for the angle \\( n\\theta \\).\n\nThe analogous theorem in the circle may be developed as follows:—In the circle \\( OBA \\), (fig. 24) take the arcs \\( AB = BB_i = B_iB_{ii} = B_{ii}B_{iii} \\ldots \\&c. = 2S \\). Let the diameter be \\( G \\). Then \\( OB = G \\cos S, OB_i = G \\cos 2S, OB_{ii} = G \\cos 3S \\ldots \\&c. \\) and \\( AB = G \\sin S, AB_i = G \\sin 2S, AB_{ii} = G \\sin 3S \\ldots \\&c. \\)\n\nNow as the lines in the second group are always at right angles to those in the first, and as such a change is denoted by the symbol \\( \\sqrt{-1} \\), we get\n\n\\[ OB + BA = G (\\cos S + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin S), \\]\n\\[ OB_i + B_iA = G (\\cos 2S + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin 2S) = G (\\cos S + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin S)^2; \\]\n\\[ OB_{ii} + B_{ii}A = G (\\cos 3S + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin 3S) = G (\\cos S + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin S)^3\\&c. \\]\n\nLXV. The known theorem, that a parabola is the reciprocal polar of a circle, whose circumference passes through the focus, suggests a transformation, which will exhibit a much closer analogy between the formulæ for the rectification of the parabola and the circle, than when the centre of the latter curve is taken as the origin.\n\nLet \\( OBA \\) be a semicircle, let the origin be placed at \\( O \\), let the angle \\( AOB = S \\), and let \\( G \\), as before, be the diameter of the circle. Through \\( B \\) draw the tangent \\( BP \\); let fall on this tangent the perpendicular \\( OP = p \\), and let \\( BP \\) the protangent be equal to \\( t \\).\n\nNow as \\( p = G \\cos S \\), and \\( t = G \\sin S \\cos S \\), as also the angle \\( AOP = 2S \\), if we apply to the circle the formula for rectification in (33.), we shall have the arc\n\n\\[ AB = s = 2G \\int \\cos^2 S dS - G \\sin S \\cos S. \\]\n\nMake the imaginary transformations \\( \\cos S = \\sec \\theta \\), and \\( \\sin S = \\sqrt{-1} \\tan \\theta \\), and we shall have\n\n\\[ \\frac{s}{G \\sqrt{-1}} = 2 \\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\cos^2 \\theta} - \\sec \\theta \\tan \\theta. \\]\n\nThe expression for an arc of a parabola, diminished by its protangent.\nThe protangent to the circle, which is exhibited in this formula, disappears in the actual process of integration; while in the parabola, the protangent which is involved in the differential, is evolved by the process of integration.\n\nAs in the parabola, the perpendicular, from the focus on the tangent, bisects the angle between the radius vector and the axis of the curve; so in the circle, the radius vector OB drawn from the extremity of the diameter, bisects the angle between the perpendicular OP and the diameter OA.\n\nThere are some curious analogies between the parabola and the circle, considered under this point of view.\n\nIn the parabola, the points T, T₁, T₂, which divide the lines\n\n\\[ g (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta), \\quad g [\\sec (\\theta - \\theta) + \\tan (\\theta - \\theta)], \\quad \\text{&c.} \\]\n\ninto their component parts, are upon tangents to the parabola. The corresponding points B, B₁, B₂ in the circle, are on the circumference of the circle.\n\nIn the parabola the extremities of the lines \\( g (\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta) \\) are on a right line AN; in the circle, the extremities of the bent lines \\( G (\\cos \\phi + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin \\phi) \\) are all in the point A.\n\nThe locus of the point T, the intersections of the tangents to the parabola with the perpendiculars from the focus, is a right line; or in other words, while one end of a protangent rests on the parabola, the other end rests on a right line. So in the circle, while one end of the protangent rests on the circle, the other end rests on a cardioid, whose diameter is equal to that of the circle, and whose cusp is at O. OPP₁A is the cardioid.\n\nThe length of the tangent AT to any point T is \\( g \\tan \\theta \\). The length of the cardioid is \\( 2G \\sin \\phi \\).\n\nIt is singular that the imaginary formulæ in trigonometry have long been discovered, while the corresponding real expressions have escaped notice. Indeed, it was long ago observed by Lambert, and by other geometers—the remark has been repeated in almost every treatise on the subject since—that the ordinates of an equilateral hyperbola might be expressed by real exponentials, whose exponents are sectors of the hyperbola; but the analogy, being illusory, never led to any useful results. And the analogy was illusory from this, that it so happens the length and area of a circle are expressed by the same function, while the area of an equilateral hyperbola is a function of an arc of a parabola. The true analogue of the circle is the parabola.\n\nLXVI. Let \\( \\bar{\\omega} \\) be the conjugate amplitude of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\psi \\), while \\( \\omega \\) is the conjugate amplitude, as before, of \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\chi \\).\n\nThen as\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{d\\bar{\\omega}}{\\cos \\bar{\\omega}} = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{\\cos \\omega} + \\int \\frac{d\\psi}{\\cos \\psi}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{\\cos \\omega} = \\int \\frac{d\\phi}{\\cos \\phi} + \\int \\frac{d\\chi}{\\cos \\chi}, \\]\n\nwe shall have\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{d\\bar{\\omega}}{\\cos \\bar{\\omega}} = \\int \\frac{d\\phi}{\\cos \\phi} + \\int \\frac{d\\chi}{\\cos \\chi} + \\int \\frac{d\\psi}{\\cos \\psi}; \\]\nand if \\((k.\\omega), (k.\\phi), (k.\\chi)\\) and \\((k.\\psi)\\) are four corresponding parabolic arcs,\n\n\\[(k.\\omega) - (k.\\phi) - (k.\\chi) - (k.\\psi) = k \\tan(\\phi + \\chi) \\tan(\\phi + \\psi) \\tan(\\chi + \\psi), \\ldots (350.)\\]\n\nwhich gives a simple relation between four conjugate parabolic arcs.\n\nLet, in the preceding formula, \\(\\phi = \\chi = \\psi\\), and we shall have\n\n\\[(k.\\omega) - 3(k.\\phi) = k \\tan^3(\\phi + \\phi) = 8k \\tan^3\\phi \\sec^3\\phi. \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (351.)\\]\n\nWe are thus enabled to assign the difference between an arc of a parabola and three times another arc, \\(\\omega = (\\phi + \\phi + \\phi)\\).\n\nIf in \\((\\varpi)\\) (341,) we make \\(\\phi = \\chi = \\psi\\), \\(\\tan\\omega = 4 \\tan^3\\phi + \\tan\\phi\\).\n\nIntroduce into this expression, the imaginary transformation \\(\\tan\\phi = \\sqrt{-1} \\sin\\theta\\), and we shall get \\(\\sin 3\\theta = -4 \\sin^3\\theta + \\sin\\theta\\), which is the known formula for the trisection of a circular arc. (351.) may therefore be taken as the formula which gives the trisection of an arc of a parabola.\n\nWhen there are five parabolic arcs, whose normal angles \\(\\phi, \\chi, \\psi, \\nu, \\Omega\\) are related as above, namely,\n\n\\[\\omega = \\phi + \\chi, \\quad \\bar{\\omega} = \\omega + \\psi = \\phi + \\chi + \\psi, \\quad \\Omega = \\phi + \\chi + \\psi + \\nu,\\]\n\nwe get the following relation,\n\n\\[(k.\\Omega) - (k.\\phi) - (k.\\chi) - (k.\\psi) - (k.\\nu) = k \\tan(\\phi + \\chi + \\nu) \\tan(\\chi + \\psi + \\nu) \\tan(\\psi + \\phi + \\nu), (352.)\\]\n\na formula which connects five parabolic arcs, whose amplitudes are derived by the given law.\n\nWe might pursue this subject very much further; but enough has been done to show the analogy which exists between the trigonometry of the circle and that of the parabola. As the calculus of angular magnitude has always been referred to the circle as its type, so the calculus of logarithms may, in precisely the same way, be referred to the parabola as its type.\n\nThe obscurities, which hitherto have hung over the geometrical theory of logarithms, have it is hoped been now removed. It is possible to represent logarithms, as elliptic integrals usually have been represented, by curves devised to exhibit some special property only; and accordingly, such curves, while they place before us the properties they have been constructed to represent, fail generally to carry us any further. The close analogies which connect the theory of logarithms with the properties of the circle will no longer appear inexplicable*.\n\n* The views above developed, on the trigonometry of the parabola, throw much light on a controversy long carried on between Leibnitz and J. Bernoulli on the subject of the logarithms of negative numbers. Leibnitz insisted they were imaginary, while Bernoulli argued they were real, and the same as the logarithms of equal positive numbers. Euler espoused the side of the former, while D'Alembert coincided with the views of Bernoulli. Indeed, if we derive the theory of logarithms from the properties of the hyperbola (as geometers always have done), it will not be easy satisfactorily to answer the argument of Bernoulli—that as an hyperbolic area represents the logarithm of a positive number, denoted by the positive abscissa \\(+x\\), so a negative number, according to conventional usage, being represented by the negative abscissa \\(-x\\), the corresponding hyperbolic area should denote its logarithm also. All this obscurity is cleared up by the theory developed in the text, which completely establishes the correctness of the views of Leibnitz and Euler.\nOn Conjugate Arcs of a Spherical Parabola.\n\nLXVII. The well-known relations between elliptic integrals of the first order, whose amplitudes are conjugate, develop some very elegant geometrical theorems.\n\nThus in fig. (25.), since the arc $AQ = \\int j \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\varphi}{1 - \\varphi}} + QR$, and the arc $BQ = \\int j \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\chi}{1 - \\chi}} + QR'$,\nthe arcs $AQ + BQ = j \\left[ \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\varphi}{1 - \\varphi}} + \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\chi}{1 - \\chi}} \\right] + QR + QR'$. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (a.)\n\nNow $AQ + BQ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, two quadrants of the spherical parabola, and $QR + QR' = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, whence half the circumference, or $AQB = j \\left[ \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\varphi}{1 - \\varphi}} + \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\chi}{1 - \\chi}} \\right] + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. . . . . . . . . . (b.)\n\nIn XXII. it has been shown that the complete integral represents the semicircumference, whence\n\n$AQB = j \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{dw}{\\sqrt{1 - w}} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (b.)\n\nComparing these equations (a.) and (b.) together, we get\n\n$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{dw}{\\sqrt{1 - w}} = \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\varphi}{1 - \\varphi}} + \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\chi}{1 - \\chi}}$.\n\nNow as the triangle $RR'/P$ is a quadrantal right-angled triangle, the relation between the angles $AFR$, $BER'$, or $\\varphi$ and $\\chi$, is easily discovered. Since $FPE$ is a spherical triangle right-angled at $P$, and $FE = 2 \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\gamma$, we get $j \\tan \\varphi \\tan \\chi = 1$.\n\nWhen $AQ = BQ$, $\\varphi = \\chi$, and $\\tan \\varphi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}}$.\n\nThe locus of the point $P$ is a spherical ellipse, supplemental to the former, having the extremities of its principal minor arc, in the foci $F$, $E$ of the former.\n\nLXVIII. Let $\\sigma$, $\\sigma_i$, $\\sigma_{ii}$ be three arcs of a spherical parabola, corresponding to the conjugate amplitudes $\\varphi$, $\\chi$, $\\omega$. Then successively substituting these amplitudes in (58.), the resulting equation becomes\n\n$\\sigma + \\sigma_i - \\sigma_{ii} = j \\left[ \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\varphi}{1 - \\varphi}} + \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{d\\chi}{1 - \\chi}} - \\int \\frac{dw}{\\sqrt{1 - w}} \\right] + \\tau + \\tau_i - \\tau_{ii}$.\n\nBut as the amplitudes $\\varphi$, $\\chi$, $\\omega$ are conjugate, the sum of these integrals of the first order is $0$, whence\n\n$\\sigma + \\sigma_i - \\sigma_{ii} = \\tau + \\tau_i - \\tau_{ii}$. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (353.)\n\nOr, when the amplitudes of three arcs in the spherical parabola are conjugate amplitudes, the sum of the arcs is equal to the sum of the protangents. We use the word sum in its algebraic sense.\nOn Conjugate Arcs of a Spherical Ellipse.\n\nLXIX.

Since the protangents vanish at the summits of these curves, there must be some intermediate position at which they attain their maximum. When the curve has but one summit, as is the case in the parabola, the hyperbola, the logarithmic parabola, and the logarithmic hyperbola, there evidently can be no maximum*.\n\nIn the plane ellipse, the protangent \\( t = \\frac{a^2 \\sin \\phi \\cos \\phi}{\\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}} \\).

We have also $\\tan^2 \\lambda = \\frac{a}{b}$. This property of the plane ellipse, called Fagnano's theorem, may be found in any elementary treatise on elliptic functions.

This will be shown by proving that the vector arcs, drawn from the centre of the curve to the extremities of the compared arcs, have the same inclination to the principal arc $2\\alpha$. Now $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ being these inclinations, as in XIV., we find \n$$\\tan^2 \\lambda = \\frac{\\tan^2 \\alpha}{\\tan^2 \\beta} \\tan^2 \\psi,$$\nand (39.) shows that $\\tan \\phi = \\cos \\epsilon \\tan \\lambda$.

To determine the inclination, to the horizontal plane, of the tangent drawn to any point of the spherical ellipse. The spherical ellipse being taken as the curve of intersection of a cylinder by a sphere as in (X.), through a side \\( Rr \\) of the cylinder let a plane be drawn, it will cut the sphere in a small circle, which will touch the spherical ellipse in the point \\( r \\), and will cut the base of the hemisphere in the right line \\( RP \\), which touches the base of the cylinder at the point \\( R \\). Let \\( O \\) be the centre of the sphere and \\( Z \\) the centre of the spherical hyperconic. Through the line \\( OZ \\) let a plane be drawn at right angles to the plane of the small circle \\( RrP \\), it will cut the sphere in the arc of a great circle \\( Zr \\) at right angles to the arc \\( rP \\); and as the three planes, namely, the horizontal plane, the plane of the small circle, and the plane of the great circle \\( ZOP \\), are mutually at right angles, the right lines in which they intersect \\( PR, Pz, PO \\) are mutually at right angles, therefore \\( P \\) is the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the centre \\( O \\) of the base of the cylinder, to the tangent \\( RP \\) which touches the curve. \\( P \\) is also the centre of the small circle \\( Ar \\), since \\( AB \\) is a cord of the sphere. Hence \\( Ar \\) is a quadrant, and therefore, \\( rP \\) or \\( v \\) is the inclination of the element of the spherical ellipse at \\( r \\) to the base of the hemisphere. Now \\( ZO \\) is the radius of the sphere, and \\( Pr \\) that of the small circle. \\( RPO \\) is a right angle, and therefore \\( OR^2 = OP^2 + PR^2 \\). Hence\n\n\\[ RP^2 = \\frac{(A^2 - B^2)^2 \\sin^2 \\lambda_j \\cos^2 \\lambda_j}{A^2 \\cos^2 \\lambda_j + B^2 \\sin^2 \\lambda_j}. \\]\n\nWhence\n\n\\[ OR^2 = \\frac{A^4 \\cos^2 \\lambda_j + B^4 \\sin^2 \\lambda_j}{A^2 \\cos^2 \\lambda_j + B^2 \\sin^2 \\lambda_j}. \\]\n\n(a.)\n\nand therefore\n\n\\[ RP^2 = \\frac{A^4 \\cos^2 \\lambda_j + B^4 \\sin^2 \\lambda_j}{A^2 \\cos^2 \\lambda_j + B^2 \\sin^2 \\lambda_j}. \\]\n\nLet \\( Or = 1, A = \\sin \\alpha, B = \\sin \\beta \\),\n\n(b.)\n\nand as\n\n\\[ \\tan^2 \\nu = \\frac{RP^2}{Rr^2}, \\quad \\tan^2 \\nu = \\frac{(\\sin^2 \\alpha - \\sin^2 \\beta)^2 \\sin^2 \\lambda_j \\cos^2 \\lambda_j}{\\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\lambda_j + \\sin^2 \\beta \\cos^2 \\beta \\sin^2 \\lambda_j}. \\]\nLet, as in (25.), \\( \\tan \\lambda = \\cos \\varepsilon \\tan \\phi = \\frac{\\cos \\varepsilon}{\\cos \\beta} \\tan \\phi \\).

It is remarkable that the point of the curve which gives the maximum difference between the arcs, which together constitute the quadrant of the spherical ellipse, is not the point of greatest inclination. For this point is found by making \\( \\tan^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\tan \\alpha}{\\tan \\beta} \\); while the point of maximum difference is obtained by putting \\( \\tan^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\sin \\beta} \\). This is the more worthy of notice, as we shall find the two points—the point of maximum division, and the point of greatest inclination—to coincide in the logarithmic ellipse.\n\nIf we take the two plane ellipses which are the projections of the spherical ellipse, one being the perspective, and the other the orthogonal projection, and seek on these plane ellipses their points of maximum division, we shall find that the angles, which the perpendiculars on the tangents, through these points of maximum division of those plane curves, make with the principal arc, are the values which must be assigned to the amplitude \\( \\phi \\), to determine the point where the tangent to the curve has the greatest inclination to the plane of \\( xy \\), and the point which divides the quadrant into two parts, such that their difference shall be a maximum. This is plain; for the semiaxes of one ellipse are \\( k \\tan \\alpha, k \\tan \\beta \\); while the semiaxes of the other are \\( k \\sin \\alpha \\) and \\( k \\sin \\beta \\). And these angles are given by the equations\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\lambda = \\frac{\\tan \\alpha}{\\tan \\beta}; \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tan^2 \\lambda_i = \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\sin \\beta}.\n\\]\n\nOn the Maximum Protangent in the Logarithmic Ellipse.\n\nLXXV.

Substituting this expression in (a.), we get\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\tau = \\frac{\\sqrt{mn}}{(1+j)^2 - mn}.\n\\]\n\nWe shall find the importance of this expression in the next section.\n\nFrom (392.) we derive\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\tau = \\frac{mn}{(1+j)^2 - mn}.\n\\]\n\nNow\n\n\\[\n(1+j)^2 = 2 + 2j - j^2 = 2 + 2j - m - n + mn.\n\\]\n\nHence as\n\n\\[\nj = \\sqrt{(1-m)(1-n)}, \\quad (1+j)^2 - mn = [\\sqrt{1-m} + \\sqrt{1-n}]^2.\n\\]\n\nWhence we get \\( \\tan \\tau = \\frac{\\sqrt{mn}}{\\sqrt{1-m} + \\sqrt{1-n}} \\).

We have only to take in the parabola, whose semi-parameter is \\( k \\), an arc whose ordinate is \\( a-b \\), to determine the maximum protangent parabolic arc.\n\nThe value \\( \\tan \\phi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}} \\), which fixes the position and magnitude of the maximum protangent arc to the logarithmic ellipse, renders \\( \\tan^2 \\lambda = \\frac{a}{b} \\). For (150.) gives \\( \\tan^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{\\alpha} \\tan^2 \\lambda \\).

If we now make\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\phi = \\frac{1}{j} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-n)(1-m)}} \\quad \\tan^2 \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m}{1-n}} = \\frac{a}{b},\n\\]\n\nas we may infer from (171.). Now substituting this value of \\( \\tan^2 \\lambda \\) in (155.), we shall get\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\tau = \\frac{a-b}{k}.\n\\]\n\nAgain, if we differentiate the values of \\( x, y, z \\) given in (158.), the coordinates of the extremity of the arc measured from the minor axis, and substitute them in the general\nexpression for the tangent of the inclination of any curve to the plane of $xy$, namely,\n\n$$\\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}},$$\n\nand make $\\lambda = \\lambda$, we shall get, as before, putting for $\\tan^2 \\lambda = \\tan^2 \\Omega$, the value\n\n$$\\frac{a}{b}, \\quad \\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}} = \\frac{a-b}{k}.$$ \n\nHence the arcs have a common extremity, since they have the same inclination to the plane of $xy$. As $\\frac{a}{b} = \\tan^2 \\lambda$ is the value of $\\tan^2 \\lambda$, which gives the maximum protangent $= a - b$ in the plane ellipse, the base of the cylinder; it follows that the point of maximum division on the logarithmic ellipse is orthogonally projected into the point of maximum division on the plane ellipse; and the corresponding protangent in the latter $a - b$ is the ordinate of the parabolic arc, which expresses the difference between the corresponding arcs of the former. Thus, while the arcs which together constitute the quadrant on the plane ellipse, differ by the difference of the semiaxes $a - b$, the corresponding arcs of the logarithmic ellipse will differ by an arc of a parabola whose ordinate is $a - b$.\n\nLXXVI. When the amplitude $\\phi$ is given by the equation $\\tan \\phi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}}$, or when the protangent is a maximum, the corresponding arc of the spherical ellipse, or of the logarithmic ellipse, may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders only. This may be shown as follows. When $\\tan \\phi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}}$, the arcs $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma_i$ of the spherical ellipse, or the arcs $\\Sigma$ and $S$ of the logarithmic ellipse, together make up the quadrant $C$. Hence $\\sigma + \\sigma_i = C$, or $\\Sigma + S = C$. But we have also $\\sigma_i - \\sigma = \\tau$, as in (52.), and $S - \\Sigma = \\tau$, as in (160.). Therefore\n\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{C - \\tau}{2}, \\quad \\sigma_i = \\frac{C + \\tau}{2}, \\quad S = \\frac{C + \\tau}{2}, \\quad \\Sigma = \\frac{C - \\tau}{2}.$$ \n\nOr $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma_i$, or $\\Sigma$ and $S$ may be expressed as simple functions of $C$ and $\\tau$. Now $C$, the quadrant, as we have shown in the last section, may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders only, while $\\tau$ is an arc either of a circle or of a parabola. Hence an elliptic integral of the third order, whose amplitude $\\phi = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{j}}\\right)$, may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders only.\n\nSection X.—On Derivative Hyperconic Sections.\n\nLXXVII. We shall now proceed to show that, when a hyperconic section is given, whether it be spherical or paraboloidal, we may from it derive a series of curves, whose moduli and parameters shall decrease or increase according to a certain law; so that ultimately the rectification of these curves may be reduced to the calculation of circular or parabolic arcs, or in other words, to circular functions or logarithms. We shall also show that all these derived curves, together with the original curve, may be traced on the same generating surface, i.e. on the same sphere or paraboloid.\nIn (186.) we have shown that the rectification of a plane ellipse whose semiaxes are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), may be reduced to the rectification of another plane ellipse whose semiaxes \\(a_i = a + b\\), \\(b_i = 2\\sqrt{ab}\\), of which the eccentricity is less than that of the former. \\(a + b\\) is that portion of the tangent, drawn through the point of maximum division, which lies between the axes; and \\(\\sqrt{ab}\\) is the perpendicular from the centre on it.\n\nWe have shown in (63.) and (74.), that if \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are connected by the equation\n\n\\[\n\\tan(\\psi - \\phi) = j \\tan \\phi;\n\\]\n\nwhile \\(i\\) and \\(i_j\\) are so related, that \\(i_j = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - i^2}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - i^2}} = \\frac{1 - j}{1 + j^2}\n\\]\n\nwe shall have\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d\\phi}{\\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}} = \\frac{(1 + i)}{2} \\int \\frac{d\\psi}{\\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\psi}} = \\frac{(1 + i)}{2} \\int \\frac{d\\psi}{\\sqrt{I_j}}.\n\\]\n\nLet us now introduce this suggested transformation into the elliptic integral of the third order, circular form and negative parameter. In (191.) we found\n\n\\[\n2 \\sin^2 \\phi = 1 + i_j \\sin^2 \\psi - \\cos \\psi \\sqrt{I_j}.\n\\]\n\nNow\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d\\phi}{M \\sqrt{I}} = \\int \\frac{d\\phi}{[1 - m \\sin^2 \\phi] \\sqrt{1 - i^2 \\sin^2 \\phi}}.\n\\]\n\nOr replacing \\(\\phi\\) by its equivalent functions in \\(\\psi\\), and recollecting that \\(m - n + mn = i^2\\), since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are conjugate parameters, we shall find\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d\\phi}{M \\sqrt{I}} = (1 + i_j) \\int \\frac{d\\psi}{[2 - m - mi_j \\sin^2 \\psi + m \\cos \\psi \\sqrt{I_j}] \\sqrt{I_j}}. \\quad \\ldots \\quad (394.)\n\\]\n\nWe may eliminate the radical \\(m \\cos \\psi \\sqrt{I_j}\\) from the denominator of this expression, by treating it as the sum of two terms.\n\nMultiplying and dividing the function by their difference, since \\(1 + i_j = \\frac{2}{1 + j^2}\\),\n\n\\[\n4(1 - m) \\int \\frac{d\\phi}{M \\sqrt{I}} = (1 + i_j) \\int \\frac{d\\psi}{[2 - m - mi_j \\sin^2 \\psi - m \\cos \\psi \\sqrt{I_j}] \\left[1 + \\frac{mn}{(1 + j)^2} \\sin^2 \\psi \\right] \\sqrt{I_j}}. \\quad \\ldots \\quad (395.)\n\\]\n\nNow it is truly remarkable that whether the parameter of the original function we start from be positive or negative, the parameter of the first derived integral will always be positive. Indeed it is necessary that this should be the case, because the parameters of the derived functions, increasing or diminishing as they do, must at length pass from between the limits 1 and \\(i^2\\). Should they do so, the integral would be no longer of the circular form, but of the logarithmic. Now we cannot pass from one of these forms to the other by any but an imaginary transformation. This objection does not hold when the parameter is positive, because the limits of the positive parameter are 0 and \\(\\infty\\). It is, too, worthy of remark, that the first derived parameter is always the same, whether we transform from positive or negative parameters.

There are several plane curves, whose lengths we may express by elliptic integrals of the third order. For example, the length of the elliptic lemniscate, or the locus of the intersections of central perpendiculars on tangents to an ellipse, is equal to that of a spherical ellipse, which is supplemental to itself, or the sum of whose principal arcs is equal to \\( \\pi \\). We cannot represent elliptic integrals of the third order generally, by the arcs of curves, whose equations in their simplest forms contain only two constants. Thus let \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) be the constants. We shall have two equations between the constants the parameter and the modulus of the function, \\( i=f(a, b) \\), \\( n=f'(a, b) \\). Assume \\( a \\) as invariable, and eliminate \\( b \\), we shall have one resulting equation between \\( i \\), \\( n \\), and \\( a \\), or \\( F(a, i, n)=0 \\); or \\( n \\) depends on \\( i \\).\n\nWhen there are three independent constants, as in the preceding investigations, \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( k \\), we shall have \\( i=f(a, b, k) \\), \\( n=f'(a, b, k) \\). Eliminating successively \\( b \\) and \\( k \\), we shall have two resulting equations, instead of one, \\( F(a, k, i, n)=0 \\), and \\( F'(a, b, i, n)=0 \\), or \\( i \\) and \\( n \\) depend on two equations, and may therefore be independent.\n\nERRATA.\n\nPage 319, last line, dele \\( n \\).\n—— 320, line 5, for page 6 read page 316.\n—— 328, line 12, for (47.) read (46.).\n—— 329, line 15, for (32.) read (31.).\n—— 331, line 7 from bottom, for \\( n=m=i \\), read \\( n=m=\\frac{1-j}{1+j} \\)\n—— 338, to the last line add, \\( i \\) being here the eccentricity of the base of the elliptic cylinder.\n—— 372, line 11, for Case XII. read Case XIII.\n—— 389, line 14, for Bernoulli read Bernoulli.",
