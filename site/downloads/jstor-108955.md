XX. Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism.—No. X.

By Lieut.-General Edward Sabine, R.A., President of the Royal Society.

Received June 7,—Read June 14, 1866.

I resume in this Number of the Contributions the discussion and coordination of the observations of the Antarctic Magnetic Survey executed by Her Majesty's Ships 'Erebus' and 'Terror,' under the direction of Sir James Clark Ross, R.N., aided by Captain Francis Rawdon Crozier, R.N., between the years 1839 and 1843.

I purpose in the present communication to complete the detailed exposition of the Survey by the reduction of the observations of the three magnetic elements in its concluding year, on the same general plan on which similar accounts were given of those of the preceding years in earlier communications, viz., between the Cape of Good Hope and Hobarton in 1840, and between the departure from Hobarton in November 1840, and the return to the same station in April 1841, in No. V. (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, Art. X.); and between Hobarton in July 1841 and the Falkland Islands in April 1842 in No. VI. (Philosophical Transactions, 1844, Art. VII.). The observations discussed in the present memoir are those made from the departure from the Falkland Islands in September 1842 to the second arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in April 1843. In a subsequent and concluding memoir, which I hope to present to the Society early in the ensuing session, it will be my endeavour to connect and thoroughly coordinate the several portions of the Survey, comprising in its three portions the circumnavigation of the Southern Ocean from the departure from the Cape of Good Hope in March 1840, to the return of the ships to the same station in April 1843.

The great work of M. Gauss, the 'Allgemeine Theorie des Erdmagnetismus,' had been published in the 'Resultate des magnetischen Vereins' in 1839*. No more conclusive evidence could have been produced than was presented by that work, in support of the representations which had been made to Her Majesty's Government conjointly by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, of the advisability of a southern magnetic Survey. The requisite numerical values, on which the practical application of the "Allgemeine Theorie" depended as a representation of the magnetic phenomena of the globe, and which were taken at equidistant meridional points on parallels of latitude, were necessarily limited, by the imperfection of our then knowledge, to seven such parallels, the most southern of which was the parallel of 40° south. The investigations and conclusions resulting from the Survey now under consideration, aided by the supplementary voyage of Her Majesty's Ship 'Pagoda,' under

* An English translation of this work was published in 1840 in the VI.th Part of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs.
Lieuts. Moore, R.N, and Clerk, R.A. (Contribution No. VIII., Philosophical Transactions, 1846, Art. XVIII.), supply the means for a future revision of M. Gauss's work, by the extension of the numerical values of the three elements to equidistant meridional points on three additional southern parallels, viz., those of 50°, 60°, and 70° of South Latitude.

In resuming the reduction and coordination of the observations of the Antarctic Magnetic Survey, it may be permitted to recall to remembrance that the system, in accordance with which the surveying compasses both of the 'Erebus' and 'Terror' were employed, was the same which had been originally adopted by the writer of these Contributions, and its practical value exemplified, in H.M. Ship 'Isabella,' in the first of the voyages of Arctic discovery in 1818, as described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819, Art. VIII. The position of the standard compass, and the methods adopted to provide the data required for the investigation and eventual correction of the deviations occasioned by the disturbing influence of the ship's iron, were the same. In M. Poisson's 'Mémoire sur les déviations de la boussole produites par le fer des vaisseaux' (1838), the applications and verifications of the fundamental equations of his theory were exemplified and established by M. Poisson himself (pp. 47–49), by the accordance of their calculated results with the facts observed and recorded in the Arctic voyages of 1818, 1819, and 1820. The convenient and practical formulae for computing the corrections of the three magnetic elements, which were subsequently derived from Poisson's fundamental Equations by Mr. Archibald Smith (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, Art. X.), have since furnished, and still continue to furnish, the means of surmounting, even in an extreme case, such as that of a survey executed in the high magnetic latitudes of the southern hemisphere, and in dips even exceeding −88°, the serious embarrassments which would otherwise have been occasioned by the iron which necessarily formed part of the equipment of the ships. Sir James Ross was one of the junior midshipmen of the 'Isabella' in the voyage of 1818; and thus early commenced that interest in the general subject of Terrestrial Magnetism, and that practical acquaintance with the resources which modern science has introduced, by which in his subsequent career he has earned for himself and for his country so distinguished a place in the history of that great branch of physical geography.

The disturbance of the needle by the influence of the ship's iron, which the term "Deviation" is now generally employed to designate, was found both in the 'Erebus' and 'Terror' to be occasioned chiefly, if not wholly, by the magnetism induced in the iron of their fittings and equipment by the vertical part of the earth's force; and to be distributed symmetrically on either side of the fore-and-aft vertical section passing through the compass. It manifested itself consequently in the southern magnetic hemisphere, and in the usual place of the Standard Compass, by a repulsion of the north end of the compass needle from the ship's head, increasing with the increase of the earth's vertical magnetic force, and producing a deviation proportional to the tangent of the Inclination. The compass-card being divided into 360°, and counted from 0° at north successively to
90° at west, 180° at south, and 270° at east, the true magnetic direction was, everywhere in the southern hemisphere, less on the points from 0° to 180° and more on the points from 180° to 360°, than the amount actually shown by the compass-card. It thus happened that, as a general practice in the 'Erebus' and 'Terror' whilst in the southern hemisphere, the deviations were recorded as negative, or —, on the western side of the compass-card, and positive, or +, on its eastern side, the signs so employed having no direct relation whatever to the distinct question whether the Declination itself were easterly or westerly. In these Contributions, and in conformity with general usage in treatises on Terrestrial Magnetism, the Declination is counted east when the north end of the magnet declines from the Geographical North towards the east, and west when the declination declines towards the west; and as both east and west declinations are found in different parts of the southern magnetic hemisphere, east declinations being characteristic by the — sign, and west declinations by the + sign, the effect of the deviations having a — sign, was to augment the apparent or observed declination on the eastern points, and diminish it on the western points, in those parts of the hemisphere where the declination itself was east; and, vice versa, to diminish the apparent or observed declination on the eastern points and augment it on the western points in those parts of the hemisphere where the declination itself was west.

Corrections applied to the Observations of the Declination for the Ship's Attraction.

1. In the 'Erebus.'—In the subjoined Table (No. I.), columns 2 and 3 exhibit the deviations observed in the 'Erebus' on the points specified in column 1, at Port Louis in the Falkland Islands, on August 19, 1842, recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for 1844, page 88, and at Simon's Bay at the Cape of Good Hope on the 20th of April, 1843, which are now printed for the first time. As the observations at Port Louis were at the commencement of the third year's survey, and those at Simon's Bay at its close, and as the dip at the two stations was very nearly the same in amount, a mean of the deviations of the declination at the commencement and close of the year's survey has been adopted, and placed in column 4, as the foundation of the calculated deviations to be ascribed to intermediate times and localities. With these values of the deviation on the several points, the constants B, C, D, and E in the equations by which the deviations in dips of other amounts may be computed have been obtained, employing for that purpose the method described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1846, Art. XVIII., pages 350–352. The constants thus derived are as follows:

\[ B = -2^\circ 32' \ast; \quad C = -0^\circ 08'; \quad D = +0^\circ 22'; \quad E = +05'. \]

\* B supplies the well-known coefficient \( a \) so much used in the earlier Numbers of these Contributions (\( B = a \tan \delta \)). Comparing only those values of \( a \) which were obtained after the arrival of the 'Erebus' in the Southern Hemisphere, the mean of the observations at Hobarton in 1840 and 1841 gave \( a = 0.0272 \) (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, Art. X. p. 154); those at the Falkland Islands in August 1842, 0.0292 (Philosophical Transactions, 1844, Art. VII. p. 88); and by the observations now discussed \( a = 0.0331 \); the increased value being doubtless due to the magnetism acquired and temporarily retained in the high southern dips to which the 'Erebus' had been subject whilst in the Antarctic seas.
Column 5 contains the deviations computed with these constants, employing for that purpose the Table in pages 352, 353 of the same Number of the Contributions; and column 6 shows the differences between the deviations so computed for the dip of $-53^\circ$, and the mean deviations observed at Port Louis, where the dip was $-52^\circ 20'$, and at Simon's Bay, where it was $-53^\circ 26'$. The differences are all well within the limits of errors of observation, and may justly be deemed insignificant. Employing the same coefficients, the deviations were computed corresponding successively to dips of $-56^\circ$, $-59^\circ$, $-62^\circ$, and $-65^\circ$, comprehending the whole range encountered in the third year's survey; and a Table was formed by interpolation for the intermediate degrees, which has been employed in correcting the Table of the declinations observed on board the 'Erebus' between Port Louis in August 1842, and the Cape of Good Hope in April 1843.

2. In the 'Terror.'—A precisely similar process has been pursued in computing the corrections to be applied for the influence of the ship's iron upon the observations of the declination in the 'Terror' in this portion of the survey, commencing at Port Louis in August 1842, and terminating at Simon's Bay, Cape of Good Hope, in April 1843.

The deviations on the thirty-two points observed at Port Louis in August 1843, have been already printed in a Table in No. VI. of these Contributions (Philosophical Transactions, 1844, Art. VII. p. 89); and those observed at Simon's Bay in April 1843 are now printed for the first time in page 457; their mean results are shown in the subjoined Table, No. II. The constants B, C, D, and E in the equations, by which the deviations in dips of other amounts may be derived, have been obtained in the manner already described in the case of the 'Erebus;' their values are

\[ B = -2^\circ 37'; \quad C = -0^\circ 20'; \quad D = +0^\circ 17'; \quad E = +0^\circ 04'. \]
The deviations computed with these values for the dip of $-53^\circ$ are shown in column 5 of Table II., and column 6 of the same Table shows the differences between the observed and computed deviations in the dip of $-53^\circ$. Employing the same constants, a Table of the deviations in dips of $-56^\circ$, $-59^\circ$, $-62^\circ$, and $-65^\circ$, with interpolated values at the intermediate degrees, has been computed, and has been employed in assigning the "corrections for deviation" in the Table of Declinations observed on board the 'Terror' between Port Louis in August 1842, and Simon's Bay in April 1843.

(Note.—It must be borne in mind that the "corrections for the ship's attraction," which appear in the Tables at the close of this and the earlier Numbers of these Contributions have, of course, the opposite signs to the "deviations" which they are designed to correct.)

**Inclination and Total Force.**

In the third year of the Antarctic Survey, as in the two preceding years, by far the greater part of the determinations both of the Inclination and of the Total Force were made at sea with Mr. Fox's apparatus, which is fully described (as well as the modes of employing it) in the article on Terrestrial Magnetism in the 'Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry,' third edition, 1859, Appendix, No. 3. This apparatus was always used in the one selected spot in each ship; the face of the circle always towards the east (unless expressly mentioned otherwise), and the marked side of the needle towards the observer. The poles of the needle were at no time reversed, and great care was taken in mounting and dismounting it to avoid injury either to the axle or to the pivots.

The index-error occasioned by the face of the needle being always directed towards the east, was examined by comparison with results obtained with needles whose poles
were reversed and the needle and circle used in the eight ordinary positions, whenever opportunities presented themselves for the comparison either on land or on ice. The needles were distinguished as R, F, 5 in the 'Erebus,' and F, C, B in the 'Terror.'

The dips were observed either "Direct" or by the aid of "Deflectors;" the intensities of the Force occasionally by weights and occasionally by deflectors; on land always by both methods, and at sea occasionally so. In the 'Erebus' and 'Terror,' in which the whole, or nearly the whole of the disturbance arising from the ship's iron was caused by induced magnetism, the deviation of the declination in the southern hemisphere was, as we have seen, a maximum to the East when the ship's head was to the West, and to the West when the head was to the East, passing through its zero when the ship's head was either north or south, or nearly so. In the Inclination and Total Force, on the other hand, the deviation (always speaking of the phenomena in the Southern Hemisphere) was a maximum when the ship's head was approximately either north or south, and passed through its zero as the ship's head was directed towards the east or towards the west. The dip of the south end of the magnet was least and the south polar force greatest when the ship's head was to the south, and the south dip greatest and the south polar force least when the head was to the north.

Corrections to be applied for the Deviations of the Inclination.

1. In the 'Erebus.'—The values of the constants $c$ and $d$, employed in the correction of the deviations of the Inclination observed in this portion of the Survey, have been derived from the results obtained at the usual place of observation on board, with the ship's head on the different points of the compass, by the well-known process of "swinging the ship;" such results were obtained at Port Louis on the 17th of August, 1842, and at Simon's Bay on the 20th of April, 1843, the interval between those dates comprising the whole of the third year's survey. The observations made at Port Louis on the 17th of August, 1842, are printed in No. VI. of these Contributions (Philosophical Transactions, 1844, Art. VII., p. 168). Those at Simon's Bay on the 20th of April, 1843, will be found in page 459 of the present Number.

At Port Louis the mean of the results on the sixteen points was $-52^\circ 24'$; and the Inclination observed on shore with the same instrument with the face of the circle also towards the east, and the needle observed "direct" and with "deflectors," was $-52^\circ 28'$.

At Simon's Bay the mean on the sixteen points was $-53^\circ 42'$, and the Inclination observed on shore with the same instrument, face east and needle "direct" and with "deflector S," was $-53^\circ 37'5$. In both cases the mean of the results on the sixteen points has been taken as the standard of reference for assigning the deviation on the several points.

In the subjoined Table (Table III.), column 2 contains the dips observed at Port Louis on the different points of the compass specified in column 1; and column 3 the deviation on each point from the mean of the sixteen points stated at the foot of the column.
Columns 4 and 5 exhibit the same particulars at Simon's Bay. In column 6 is placed the mean deviation at the two stations, and in column 7 the mean deviation applied to $-53^\circ 0'$ taken as an approximate mean dip common to both stations. In columns 8 and 9 are shown the values of $\zeta'$ and $\zeta$ on each point of the compass, $\zeta'$ being the azimuth of the ship's head by the standard compass, and $\zeta$ tabular or calculated values derived from the observed deviations of the declination on the same points. Column 10 contains the dips on the different points computed by the several constants, which are as follows:

$$B = a \tan \theta = -0.0441 \} \text{derived from the deviations of the Declination.}$$

$$b = 1 - 2D = +0.9875 \}$$

$$c = +0.0195 \} \text{derived from the deviations of the Dip in column 7.}$$

$$d = +0.9936 \}$$

And, finally, in column 11 are shown the differences between the observed and the computed deviations.

The values of $c$ and $d$ have been computed by equation (9) (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, p. 148) on all points excepting north and south; and on those points by equation (10). The computed dips by equation (13) on all points excepting east and west, on which points equation (12) has been substituted.

The Table for the correction of the deviations of the dip in the third year's survey has been formed by computing, by means of the above constants, the deviations in dips successively of $-53^\circ$, $-59^\circ$, and $-65^\circ$, and interpolating the intermediate values.

2. In the 'Terror.'—The constants $c$ and $d$ in this ship have been derived from the
deviations observed on the sixteen principal points of the compass at Port Louis on August 15th, 1842, and at Simon’s Bay on April 20th, 1843. The observations at Port Louis have been already printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1844, Part II. p.195. Those at Simon’s Bay are now given in page 461 of the present communication. The results obtained with Needle F.C.B. by the direct observation have been employed for this purpose in preference to a mean between them and those obtained by deflector N., in consequence of a small uncertainty in the index-correction of the results with the deflector (Philosophical Transactions, 1844, Part II. Art. VII. p. 106). At Port Louis the arithmetical mean of the Inclinations observed on the sixteen points ($-51^\circ 31'$) has been taken as the standard, by comparison with which the deviations on the several points have been assigned. The same needle, when observed on shore on the 25th of July, 1842, with the face of the circle towards the east, and the needle direct, gave

\[
\begin{align*}
-51^\circ & \quad 34.4' \\
-51^\circ & \quad 31.6' \\
-51^\circ & \quad 31.5' \\
-51^\circ & \quad 32.2'
\end{align*}
\]

Mean $-51^\circ 32.4'$

At Simon’s Bay the arithmetical mean of the Inclinations observed with needle F.C.B. used “direct,” and with the face of the circle towards the east, on the sixteen points, viz., $-52^\circ 40'$, has been in like manner taken as the standard of comparison for the results on the several points. The same needle when observed with on shore on the 6th of April, face east and needle “direct,” gave

\[
\begin{align*}
-52^\circ & \quad 49' \\
-52^\circ & \quad 45' \\
-52^\circ & \quad 47' \\

Mean $-52^\circ 47'$

page 531 of the present communication.

In the subjoined Table (Table IV.) column 2 contains the dips observed at Port Louis on the points of the compass specified in column 1, and column 3 the deviations on each point from the mean placed at the foot of column 2. Columns 4 and 5 exhibit the same particulars at Simon’s Bay. In column 6 is placed the mean deviation at the two stations, and in column 7 the mean deviation applied to $-53^\circ$, taken as an approximate mean dip at both stations. In columns 8 and 9 are shown the values of $\zeta'$ and $\zeta$ on each point, viz., $\zeta'$, the azimuth of the ship’s head shown by the standard compass and consequently affected by the deviation, and $\zeta$ the true direction computed from the observed declinations and shown in Table II. Column 10 exhibits the dips on the several points computed by the coefficients;
B = a \tan b = -0.458 \{ \text{derived from the deviations of the Declination.} \\
b = 1 - 2D = +0.9901 \} \\
c = +0.0106 \{ \text{derived from the deviations of the Dip in column 7.} \\
d = +0.9950 \}

And, finally, in column 11 are shown the differences between the observed and the computed dips. The values of \( c \) and \( d \) have been derived by equation (9) (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, p. 148) on all the points from N.N.W. to S.S.W. and from N.N.E. to S.S.E.; and on the north and south points by equation (10): the computed dips by equation (13) on all points excepting east and west, and on those points by equation (12).

The Table for the correction of the deviations of the dip in the third year's survey has been formed by computing, by means of the coefficients above stated, the deviations in dips successively of \(-53^\circ\), \(-59^\circ\), and \(-65^\circ\), and interpolating the intermediate values.

### Variation in the Intensity of the Magnetic Force.

The Magnetic Survey which is here discussed was carried on chiefly by observations made at sea, and (in reference to the variations of the Magnetic Force especially) by instruments and methods either wholly novel or very nearly so. Some little repetition of what may have been already said some years ago must therefore be hazarded (and it is hoped will be pardoned), in the endeavour to convey an intelligible description of the methods by which the objects of the Survey were sought to be accomplished, and of the

MDCCCLXVI.
precautions which were adopted to supply, as far as circumstances would permit, the means of checking every part of the various processes.

The difficulty which presented itself on the first aspect, and whilst the survey was as yet only in the preliminary stage of contemplation, was to procure a proper basis for the determinations of the magnetic force. As the survey was designed to furnish not merely a map of the Isodynamic lines corresponding to the present epoch, but also such determinations as, repeated after the lapse of a century or centuries, should enable physicists of future times to derive and place on a satisfactory foundation a general theory of the secular changes to which the phenomena of each of the elements of terrestrial magnetism are known to be subject, it was necessary that the values of the magnetic force should be determined in absolute measure, at certain points which should serve as a base for the whole operations of the survey, and should be so situated as to embrace them all.

The difficulty which has been thus stated was surmounted by combining in one and the same recommendation to Her Majesty's Government, the prosecution of the Southern Magnetic Survey, and the establishment of fixed magnetic observatories at certain localities in the British Colonies, two of which, the Cape of Good Hope and Hobarton, were convenient of access and would comprehend between them nearly the whole of the isodynamic lines which should be included in the survey.

The groundwork of the survey, as regards the variations of the magnetic force, is thus to be found in the determinations made at the magnetic observatories of Hobarton and the Cape of Good Hope, of the absolute values of the magnetic force at those stations in and about the years in which the survey was in progress. A summary of the investigations on which these values are founded forms, therefore, a subject of primary consideration in this section of the present Contribution: pages 463 and 464.

The instruments and methods by which the variations of the magnetic force at other land stations than Hobarton and the Cape of Good Hope, and in the almost daily observations on board each of the ships, were investigated, were devised by Mr. Robert Were Fox, F.R.S., and were described in publications at the date of their invention, and more recently in the 'Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry,' Ed. 1859, Appendix No. 2. The mode of procedure for obtaining the ratios to an absolute value of the force determined at a base station has been explained in No. III. of these Contributions, Philosophical Transactions, 1842, Art. XI. page 9 et seq. In observations made at sea the ratios, whether obtained by constant weights or by deflectors, are liable to be affected by three sources of error, viz., (1) by the influence of the ship's iron, (2) by variations of temperature producing corresponding variations in the magnetism of the needle, and (3) by an alteration—progressive or sudden—which may possibly take place in the magnetism of the needle in the course of the survey, and which when it does occur is usually a loss of magnetism. Of these three sources of error the first is the most certain and important, and requires to be met by corrections investigated and applied in modes analogous to those already treated of in the cases of the Declination and of the Dip. The influence of variations of temperature on Mr. Fox's needles has always been found on investigation
to be extremely small, and unless in cases when a more than ordinary accuracy is desired, the correction on this account may be regarded as insignificant. The third correction, or that for any notable change in the magnetism of the needle which may take place from time to time, may present greater difficulties than either of the two others, inasmuch as when such change has been shown to have occurred in the interval (sometimes of considerable length) between the comparisons made and repeated at base stations, it may not be always possible to assign the precise date at which the change commenced or terminated, or the proportions in which it should be allotted to different portions of the interval. It is always therefore extremely satisfactory to find, as will be shown to have been the case in the 'Erebus' and 'Terror,' that the intensity-needles preserved their magnetism absolutely without sensible change throughout the interval, i.e. in the present case from the time of their departure from Hobarton in April 1841 until their arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in April 1843: the investigation by which this is shown is subjoined; pp. 464 and 465. The correction of the sea observations for the influence of the ship's iron is subsequently discussed; viz., in p. 474.

Absolute Value in British Units of the Total Magnetic Force at the Hobarton Magnetic Observatory.

The experiments which were made at the Hobarton Magnetic Observatory for the determination of the absolute value of the total magnetic force in British units in the years when the Southern Survey was in progress, were (1) those of the absolute horizontal force, of which a fully detailed account was published in the first volume of the "Magnetical and Meteorological Observations at the Hobarton Observatory," printed in 1850, pp. 381–393; and (2) those of the Inclination, of which an also fully detailed account may be referred to in pp. 332–349 of the same volume.

For the horizontal force we find, in the preliminary discussion prefixed to the observational details in that volume, at p. xxxix., a summary of 399 results obtained by Captain Kay, R.N., and his assistants, with seven magnets of different lengths, between August 1843 and December 1848, of which the arithmetical mean is $4.4895$ in British units, corresponding to about the middle of the year 1846. The mean secular change derived from a consecutive series of thirty-six months with the magnet which appeared to be entitled to the most dependence, was an annual decrease of $0.0027$: we have therefore $4.5000$ as the absolute value of the horizontal force corresponding to the middle of the year 1842.

In the same preliminary discussion (p. lxxiii) the Inclination derived from eighty-seven monthly determinations between 1841 and 1848 is stated to be $-70^\circ 35'6"$, corresponding in epoch to May 1845; and as the annual secular change of the Inclination at Hobarton at the period in question had been found not to exceed a small fraction of a minute, the same value may be taken approximately as applicable to the middle of the year 1842.

Hence we obtain $4.500 \times \sec. 70^\circ 35'6" = 13.540$ as (approximately) the total force in British units at the magnetic observatory at Hobarton in the middle of 1842.
Absolute Value in British Units of the Total Magnetic Force at the Cape of Good Hope Magnetic Observatory.

The experiments made at the Cape of Good Hope Observatory for the determination of the absolute value of the total force in British units at the time of the southern survey, were published in 1851 in vol. I. of the "Magnetical and Meteorological Observations at the Cape of Good Hope." Tables XXXV. and XXXVI. in pages lxiii to lxx of that volume, contain the details of thirty-five monthly determinations of the absolute horizontal force, extending, with occasional interruptions, from November 1846 to February 1850, giving as a mean result $4\cdot4969$ at the mean epoch of July 1848, and $0\cdot0061$ as the rate of annual secular decrease between March 1846 and February 1850. Hence we obtain $4\cdot5335$ as an approximate value for the middle of the year 1842. Table XIX. p. 1 of the same volume exhibits the mean results of fifty-eight monthly determinations of the Inclination, extending from June 1841 to March 1846, of which the full details are given in pages 394 to 407. The arithmetical mean is $-53^\circ 21'1"$, corresponding to Nov. 1, 1843, with a mean secular increase of south dip in each year of $5'\cdot45$; whence the approximate inclination corresponding to the middle of 1842 is $-53^\circ 13'85"$. We thus obtain $4\cdot5335 \times \sec. 53^\circ 13'85" = 7\cdot5736$ as the approximate value of the total force in British units at the Cape Observatory, corresponding to the middle of 1842.

Simon's Bay, the anchorage of the 'Erebus' and 'Terror' in 1843, is about fifteen geographical miles south of the Cape Observatory, a difference which, in conformity with the maps of the isodynamic lines in that vicinity, may be regarded as equivalent to a difference of $+0\cdot024$ of the Force, which, applied to the result at the observatory, gives $7\cdot598$ as approximately the total force at Simon's Bay in the middle of 1842.

Comparison of the results given by the needles employed in determining the ratios of the force in the sea observations, with the absolute values at Hobarton and the Cape of Good Hope.

The ratios of the force shown by these needles are measured by the angles of deflection produced in different localities by a constant weight applied to a grooved wheel attached to the axle of the needle; the intensity of the magnetic force being inversely as the sines of the angle of deflection. If we express by $\phi$ the absolute value of the force at a base station, and by $v$ the deflection caused by a constant weight at the base station, and by $\phi'$ and $v'$ corresponding values at another station, we have $\phi' = \phi \frac{\sin v}{\sin v'}$; and taking Hobarton as the base station, we have $\phi' = 13\cdot540 \frac{\sin v}{\sin v'}$. The weights employed were grains and half grains, several of each having been carefully prepared by Mr. Fox himself, and the same individual weights being, as far as possible, used throughout. The deflections caused by the different weights when the needles of the 'Erebus' and 'Terror' were observed at the magnetic observatory at Hobarton in April 1841, are shown in the
following Table, the face of the circle being directed towards the east, which was its customary position in observations at sea.

The weights and deflections observed on shore at Simon’s Bay, Cape of Good Hope, in April 1843, with the face of the circle towards the east, were as follows:

| Mean... | -1·57720 = NN ·37775 |

Hence we have the magnetic force at Simon’s Bay, as derived from the needle of the ‘Erebus’ at Hobarton $13\cdot540 \times \frac{11\cdot255}{20\cdot091} = 7\cdot585$; and from the needle of the ‘Terror’ at Hobarton $13\cdot540 \times \frac{2\cdot1031}{3\cdot7775} = 7\cdot539$. The mean between these values is $7\cdot562$. The force at the anchorage of the ‘Erebus’ and ‘Terror’ corresponding to the mean epoch of 1842.5, derived from the absolute determinations at the magnetic observatory at the Cape of Good Hope (page 458), is $7\cdot574$.

The small difference in amount between the values derived from the absolute determinations at the Cape Observatory (including the correction to Simon’s Bay), and that assigned from the Hobarton Observatory by the needles of the ‘Erebus’ and ‘Terror,’ is well within the limits of the errors of observation and of deduction; and gives full reason to infer that the magnetism of the needles underwent no material alteration in the interval.

*Deduction of the Magnetic Force at the land stations visited intermediately between Hobarton in April 1841 and Simon’s Bay in April 1843.*

In this deduction we have the advantage that the deflections by the weights were
observed with the face of the circle to the west as well as to the east at all the stations; (except in the case of the 'Terror' at St. Martin's Cove, when the deflections with the face of the circle to the west appear to have been accidentally omitted).

We have first to state the results at the base station at Hobarton with the face of the circle to the West in April 1842: those with the face of the circle to the East having been stated in page 465.

* The observations which were made at Port Louis between April 12th and August 23rd, 1842, to determine the Inclination with needles whose poles were reversed and the results obtained from the mean of the eight positions of the circle and needle, afford a favourable opportunity of judging of the accordance attainable in such results when the observations are made by skilled and careful observers, and when suitable instruments are employed. Sixty determinations were made with the Dip Circle of the 'Erebus' and its three needles R 4, R 6, and R 7, the observer being Lieut. A. J. Smith of the 'Erebus,' relieved occasionally by Mr. T. E. L. Moore of the 'Terror.' The results are detailed in the VI.th No. of these Contributions, pp. 101-103. The arithmetical mean of the sixty results is -52°25'06", and the probable error of a single result is ±1°52". It will be remembered that at the time these observations were made, the instruments which were used had already been employed for more than three years on a service of no ordinary exposure, and had been frequently disembarked for observations on land or on ice. The general accordance of the results, and the very small amount of the probable error of a single result, bear strong testimony to the care and skill of the observers, as well as to the improvement which took place in the English Dip Circles and Needles, in consequence of the pains taken by the participators in the Magnetic Survey of the British Islands in 1837 and 1838, of whom Sir James Ross was one. [Dr. Lloyd in the VII.th Volume of the Reports of the British Association, page 99, note 1; and Table III. in the same volume, p. 57.] The detailed statement of the observations at the Falkland Islands was published in the VI.th No. of these Contributions almost immediately after its receipt in England (in 1844), and afforded to all who were desirous of profiting by the instruction it conveyed a knowledge of the degree of accuracy which might be expected by the employment of the English Dip Circles and Needles, when placed in the hands of properly trained and careful observers. Even the small probable error of ±1°52" was doubtless due in great measure to "magnetic disturbances" and to the effects of "horary variation, solar and lunar," the influence of which can only be eliminated by corrections supplied by the continuous record of the magnetometers of an observatory. The probable error of the mean of the sixty observations with the circle and needles of the 'Erebus' at Port Louis is ±0°197".

Those who are interested in the accuracy with which observations of the Magnetic Dip may be made will recognize with interest and satisfaction that ±1°52", the probable error of a single result derived from the 60 observations at Port Louis, is almost precisely the same as that (±1°50") obtained by the mean of 282 independent results at the Kew Observatory (Proceedings of the Royal Society, March 1861) by several observers employing Dip Circles and Needles of the British pattern; in which results, as in those at Port Louis, no corrections for disturbing influences, derived from the continuous records of an observatory, were introduced.
Variation in the Intensity of the Magnetic Force observed by Deflectors.

1. In the 'Erebus.'—At sea, where manipulation of the weights causes exposure of the needle, which, in bad weather especially, is liable to occasion injury, the substitution of "deflecting magnets" for "weights" was frequently resorted to. In this case the ratios of intensity in different localities are inversely as the sines of the angles of deflection and directly as the weights equivalent to the deflecting force of the deflector on the needle at the respective angles; or $\varphi' = \frac{\varphi}{\sin v'} \cdot \frac{w'}{w}$, where $\varphi$, $v$, and $w$ are the intensity, the angle of deflection, and the equivalent weight at a base station, and $\varphi'$, $v'$, and $w'$ corresponding values in another locality. The method of forming a table of the equivalent weights corresponding to the deflecting force of a deflecting magnet at different angles has been explained in No. III. of these Contributions (Philosophical Transactions, 1842, Art. II. pp. 9 to 13); and a Table of the equivalent weights for the magnet R. F. 4 (used in the 'Erebus' either as Deflector S. or Deflector N., according as the Deflector was applied to either pole of the needle) is reprinted here (for convenience) from Contribution VI., Philosophical Transactions, 1844, Part 2, Art. VII. p. 114.

Regarding Hobarton as the base station of the whole of the Survey now under consideration, and 13·540 as the absolute value of the magnetic force in British units at Hobarton at the mean epoch of the Survey, the observations of the 'Erebus' at Hobarton in April 1841 supply the values $v=56° 28'·7$ and (from Table XIV.) $w=7·38$ grs., for Deflector S.; and $v=53° 02'·7$ and $w=7·07$ grs., for Deflector N.; (for Hobarton). The angles of deflection in other localities furnish the respective values of $v'$, and Table XIV. those of $w'$ corresponding to the angles $v'$. Hence we have the values of the force in other localities; viz. $\varphi' = \frac{\varphi \sin v}{w} \cdot w' \csc v' = 1·53 \cdot w' \csc v'$. The degree of accordance between the values of $\varphi'$ obtained by weights in different localities and those obtained by the deflectors is shown in the following Table, in which are included all the stations on land or ice between Hobarton in April 1841 and Port Louis in December 1842.

2. In the 'Terror.'—A spare needle, C, was employed in the 'Terror' as Deflector S. and Deflector N. according as the Deflector was applied to either pole of the Intensity needle; and two smaller magnets were used conjointly as "N. and S." The equivalent weights were obtained, as shown in the following Table, from the comparison of the angles of deflection with deflectors and weights at Hobarton in April 1841, Sydney in July 1841, Bay of Islands, New Zealand, in August and October 1841; Port Louis in the Falkland Islands from April to December 1842; St. Martin's Cove (Cape Horn) in October 1842; and Simon's Bay (Cape of Good Hope) in April 1843.

From the observations at Hobarton in April 1841 (regarded as a base station), we have φ=13°540; v with Deflector S. 33° 23', and w from Table XIV. 2°614; v with Deflector N. 36° 01', and w 2°794; and v with Magnets N and S 40° 06', and w 3°060. The angles of deflection in other localities furnish the several values of v', and Table XIV. the corresponding values of w'. Hence we obtain φ' in other localities, corresponding to 13°540 at Hobarton as the base station, by φ'= \frac{\phi \sin v}{w}. w' \cosec v'=2°85 w' \cosec v'.

The degree of accordance between the values of φ' as obtained by weights or by deflectors is shown in the following Table.

Corrections for the influence of the ship’s iron on the observations of the Intensity of the Magnetic Force.

The corrections to be applied to the intensity observations of the third year of the Survey have been derived from observations which were made with great care at Simon’s Bay (Cape of Good Hope) in the ‘Terror’ on the 7th of April 1843, and in the ‘Erebus’ on the 12th of the same month, with the ship’s head placed successively on each of the sixteen principal points as indicated by the standard compass. The arithmetical mean of the sixteen determinations has been regarded as a result in which the disturbing influences on the several points may be considered to have balanced each other, and as a true measure of the Force at the locality. The correctness of this conclusion was further established by the removal of the instruments from the ships to the shore, where the results obtained accorded well with the mean of the observations on the sixteen points on board.

In the formation of tables for the correction of the individual observations made at sea in the course of the year’s survey, the values of the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), determined by the investigations in the preceding parts of this communication, have been employed, viz.

In the ‘Erebus’ . . . \(a = -0.0331; b = +0.9875; c = +0.0195; d = +0.9936\).

In the ‘Terror’ . . . \(a = -0.0344; b = +0.9901; c = +0.0106; d = +0.9950\).

With these values tables of double entry were formed, having as arguments \(\theta\), and tabular values of \(\zeta\); employing for the Dip Corrections equations (12) and (13) (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, Art. X. p. 148); and for the Intensity Corrections

\[A'c \left( \frac{d}{c} \tan \theta + \cos \zeta \right) \cos \theta \csc \theta'\] (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, Art. X. p. 162);

\(A'\) in the ‘Erebus’ being found = 1.0051, and in the ‘Terror’ = 1.0055.

The application of these corrections to the observations with the ship’s head on the different points at Simon’s Bay, in April 1843, is shown in the following Table.

Index-corrections.—The cards of the Standard Compasses, both of the ‘Erebus’ and ‘Terror,’ were unchanged during the whole of the third year’s survey. The index-corrections appear to have been very carefully watched and frequently examined. In memoranda preserved in the handwriting of Sir James Ross and of Captain Crozier, the corrections are stated to have been constant from the departure of the ships from the Falkland Islands in September 1842 to their arrival at Simon’s Bay in April 1843. The card of the ‘Erebus’ is stated by Sir James Ross to have had an index-correction of $-1°\ 48'$; those of the ‘Terror,’ as stated by Captain Crozier,

Card P = $-0°\ 40'$, and Card R = $+1°\ 13'$.

The index-corrections of the inclination-needles employed in the ‘Fox’ circles in the sea observations (R. F. 5 in the ‘Erebus,’ and F. C. B. in the ‘Terror’) have been examined by comparing their results with those of needles whose poles were reversed and the inclination observed in the eight usual positions of the circle and needle, on several occasions at the same identical spots either on land or on the ice. With the needles of the ‘Erebus’ six such occasions presented themselves in the course of the three years’ survey (confining the comparison to land stations sufficiently free from station error). They are as follows:—
