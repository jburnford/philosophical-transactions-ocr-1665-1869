XLIX. An Account of a remarkable Meteor: In a Letter to the Reverend Thomas Birch, D.D. Secret. of R.S. from Mr. Samuel Dunn.

Reverend Sir,

Chelsea, Dec. 9th, 1763.

Read Dec. 15, 1763.

In the Months of September and October last, on many different days, but always in the afternoon, when the Sun was nearly of the same height above the horizon, I was amused with the appearance of a kind of meteor, which I do not know that it hath been before taken notice of by others. As it appeared under nearly the same circumstances at other times, and therefore may contribute towards the better understanding the theory of a parhelion, I shall give the description of this meteor, as it appeared the 6th of October last, at five o'clock afternoon. A kind of mock Sun appeared of equal altitude with the real Sun about $22\frac{1}{2}^\circ$ southerly therefrom. A little
little above the mock Sun the Sky was clear, but
the phænomenon was in the midst of clouds that
were not very dense. The diameter of this
phænomenon was nearly like that of the real
Sun, and a remarkable red stream of light pointed
therefrom as at all other times towards the real Sun,
which shined clearly at the same time. As there
was no descending rain, nor any other colour of
the rain-bow, I take this to have been a meteor
not yet registered amongst meteorological observa-
tions.

I am,

Reverend Sir,

Your most obedient servant,

Samuel Dunn.
