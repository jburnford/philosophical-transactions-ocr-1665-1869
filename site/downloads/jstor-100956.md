3. Of Grafting, and the several ways thereof; together with the due Preparation and Time for it. Here the Author treats of Stock-or Cleft-grafting; of Whip-grafting, (otherwise called Packing or Splicing;) of Shot grafting, like the shooting of two pieces of timber, as in a Ship-mast, together; of a Peculiar way of grafting, much used by some of the best Nursery-men about London, here commended for its certainty and ease dispatch; of a singular way, tried by the Author, and by him esteemed the nearest and least dangerous and hurtful for the grafting of great Stocks. In this same Chapter is discoursed of Inarching, to be used in Trees, whose Cions will not be grafted if taken clean from the Tree, whereon they grew at the first: Where the Reader is taught, how in a year or two store of Aprecocks may be produced without Inoculation, by setting before-hand Plum-stocks round about an Aprecock-Tree at such a distance, as that they may be grafted by these ways of Inarching.

4. Certain Rules to be observed in and after Grafting; together with a censure of vulgar Grafter, that always pick off the side-buds, till such time as the Tree is high enough: Adding also some advertisements for the Choice of Grafts.

5. Of Inoculation, and the principal time for it; together with directions, what sort of Trees are first to be inoculated, which last, and which between both: As also, of the quickest and safest way of Inoculation; and of the Authors opinion concerning that manner of Inoculation, which is made without taking away the wood from within the Escutcheons. To which are added instructions concerning the fittest Weather for inoculating; and how to prevent mischief by much heat, drought, and hard winter; as likewise a mark whereby to know, whether the bud have taken or no. All which is concluded with an assignment of the Cause, why the greatest part of Trees yield better and fairer fruit through Insition, than when permitted to bear from Seed? The determination of which is here attempted to be made by comparing Trees and Animals, and by the consideration of the manner of Nutrition in the latter.

6. Of Stocks raised without Seed, and Trees without Insition: concerning which the Author delivers some things concerning Stocks procured out of the Woods; and Suckers from the Roots of Trees, where Seedlings cannot be obtained. To which are added the ways of propagating Trees by Layers; as also by Roots left in the ground.
