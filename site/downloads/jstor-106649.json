  "text": "VII. On Centripetal Forces. By Edward Waring, M.D.\nF.R.S. Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge.\n\nRead January 10, 1788.\n\nPROP. I.\n\nLet a curve $PpN$ (Tab. II. fig. 1.), of which the perpendiculars to the two nearest points $P$ and $p$ of the curve are $PO$ and $pO$, and consequently $O$ the center of a circle, which has the same curvature as the given curve in the point $P$; draw $PY$ and $ly$ tangents to the curve in the points $P$ and $p$; from $S$ draw $Sy$ and $ShY$ respectively perpendiculars to the tangents $ly$ and $PY$; and let $ShY$ cut the tangent $ly$ in $h$; then will ultimately $hY (-P)$ be the decrement of the perpendicular $SY = P$; and the triangles $lbY$ and $POp$ be similar: for the angles $POp$ and $h/Y$ are equal, and the angles $lYb$ and $OPp$ right ones; therefore $PO : Pp :: lY$ ultimately $= PY : Yb$\n\ndecrement of the perpendicular, whence $Pp = \\frac{Yb \\times PO}{lY} = \\frac{Yb \\times PO}{PY}$.\n\n1.2. Fig. 2. and 1. The force in the direction $PS$ is as the ultimate ratio of $2 \\times QR$ (the space through which a body is drawn from the direction of its motion in the tangent in a given time towards the center of force); but ultimately $2QR = \\frac{2QP^2}{PV}$, where $QP$ is as the space described in a given time, and consequently as the velocity $(V)$ of the body at the given point $P$, and $PV$ the chord of curvature in the direction $SP$.\n1.3. The increment \\((Pp)\\) of the space divided by the velocity \\(V\\) is ultimately as the increment of the time, and \\(= \\) the increment of the velocity \\((\\dot{V})\\) divided by the force \\(\\frac{2V^2}{PV} \\times \\frac{PY}{SP}\\) in the direction of the tangent, that is, \\(\\frac{Pp}{V} = \\frac{\\dot{V} \\times PV \\times SP}{2V^2 \\times PY}\\); for \\(Pp\\) substitute \\(\\frac{Yb \\times PO}{PY}\\), and there results \\(-\\frac{\\dot{P} \\times PO}{PY \\times V} = \\frac{\\dot{V} \\times PV \\times SP}{2V^2 \\times PY}\\); and consequently \\(-\\frac{2\\dot{P} \\times PO}{SP \\times PV} = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{V}\\); but \\(\\frac{SP \\times PV}{2PO} = SY = P\\), whence \\(-\\frac{\\dot{P}}{P} = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{V}\\), and \\(V = \\frac{a}{p}\\), where \\(a\\) is an invariable quantity.\n\nCor. Since \\(V \\times P\\), that is, \\(SY\\) the perpendicular multiplied into the velocity (which is ultimately as \\(Pp\\) the space described in a given time) is ultimately as the area described round the center \\(S\\) in a given time; but this rectangle \\(= a\\), a given quantity; therefore the area, described round the center of force \\(S\\) in a given time, will be a given quantity, and thence in unequal times will be proportional to the times.\n\n1.4. The sagitta \\(QR\\) is ultimately as the force, when the time is given; and when the time is not given, it will be as the force into the square of the time; from which expression, by substituting for \\(QR\\) and the time their values, may be deduced several others.\n\nSir Isaac Newton has demonstrated this proposition with the greatest simplicity; and this is given to shew, that the same proposition may be deduced from different principles.\n\n**Prop. II.**\n\n1. Fig. 3. Given the relation between \\(SP'\\) the distance from a point \\(S\\), and \\(SY'\\) a perpendicular from the point \\(S\\) to \\(P'Y\\), a line touching a curve in the point \\(P'\\); to find the relation between\nbetween $Sp'$ and $Sy'$ (a perpendicular from the point $S$ to $p'y$, a line touching the curve in the point $p'$); in which two curves $PP'L$ and $pp'l$, the forces and velocities at any equal distances $SP$ and $Sp$ are equal, and consequently the perpendiculars $SY$ and $Sy$, at the above-mentioned equal distances $SP$ and $Sp$ are to each other in a given ratio $N : n$.\n\nIn the equation expressing the relation between $SP'$ and $SY'$ for $SP'$ and $SY'$ write respectively $Sp$ and $\\frac{Sy' \\times N}{n}$, and there results the equation sought: for the distances $SP$ and $Sp'$ being equal, the perpendiculars $SY'$ and $Sy'$ are as $N : n$.\n\nEx. 1. Let $S$ be the focus of a conic section, then will\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4} C^2 \\times \\frac{D}{T \\pm D} = SY^2 = P^2,$$\n\nwhere $T$ and $C$ denote its transverse and conjugate axes, and $D$ the distance $SP$; for $P$ write $\\frac{N}{n} \\times p$, and there results the equation\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4} C^2 \\times \\frac{D}{T \\pm D} = \\frac{N^2}{n^2} \\times p^2,$$\n\nwhich is an equation to a conic section of the same name (viz. ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola) as the given curve, of which the transverse axis is $T$, and conjugate $= \\frac{C \\times n}{N}$, and perpendicular from the focus to the tangent $= p$. If $T$ and $C$ are infinite, and consequently the curve a parabola, and the equation\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4} L \\times D = P^2,$$\n\nthen will the latus rectum of the resulting equation be $\\frac{L \\times n^2}{N^2}$.\n\nEx. 2. Let $S$ be the center of the logarithmic spiral, then will the equation be $a \\times SP = a \\times D = SY = P$, and consequently the resulting equation $a \\times D = \\frac{N}{n} \\times p$, whence $\\frac{an}{N} \\times D = p$ an equation to a logarithmic spiral having the same center.\n\nEx. 3. Let $T$ and $C$ be the semi-conjugate axes of a conic section, and $S$ its center; then will the equation expressing the\nthe relation between the distance $D$ and perpendicular $P$ be\n\n$$D^2 = \\frac{T^2C^2}{P} = T^2 - C^2;$$\n\nfor $P$ write as before $\\frac{N_p}{n}$, and there results the equation\n\n$$D^2 = \\frac{n^2T^2C^2}{N^2p^2} = T^2 - C^2,$$\n\nan equation to a conic section of the same name, of which the transverse and conjugate diameters are respectively two roots ($x$) of the equation\n\n$$x^2 = \\frac{n^2T^2C^2}{N^2x^2} = T^2 - C^2,$$\n\nbecause in this case $p = D$.\n\nThe sum or difference of the squares of the transverse and conjugate diameters, in all the resulting equations, will be the same.\n\nCor. In every equal distance, the chord of curvature passing through the center of force is the same; for the forces in that direction, and the velocities at every equal altitude are the same.\n\n**Prop. III.**\n\n1. Fig. 4. and 3. Given an equation $A = o$, expressing the relation between the absciss $SM = x$ and ordinate $MP = y$; to find the equation expressing the relation between $SP = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $SY = P$, the perpendicular from $S$ on the tangent $PY$. From the equation $A = o$ find $\\dot{x} = B\\dot{y}$, which substitute for $\\dot{x}$ in the equation $(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\times P = \\dot{x}\\dot{y} = \\dot{x}\\dot{y}$ deduced from the similar triangles $Pl\\alpha$, $MTP$, and $STY$, where $l\\alpha = \\dot{x}$ and $Po = \\dot{y}$; let the resulting equation be $C = o$; reduce the three equations $A = o$, $C = o$, and $x^2 + y^2 = SP^2 = D^2$ into one, so that the unknown quantities $x$ and $y$ may be exterminated, and there results an equation expressing the relation between $D$ and $P$.\n\nCor. Hence from the equation expressing the relation between $x$ and $y$, the absciss and ordinate of a curve, can be deduced an equation expressing the relation between the distance $SP$ and perpendicular $SY$; and from the equation expressing\nthe relation between the distance SP and SY can be deduced an equation expressing the relation between the distance Sp and perpendicular Sy from the point S to the tangent py of a curve, whose force and velocity at every equal distance is the same as in the given curve, but the direction different.\n\n2. Given an equation $K = o$ expressing the relation between $SP = D$ and $SY = P$; to find an equation expressing the relation between $SM = x$ and $PM = y$, the absciss and ordinate of the same curve.\n\nIn the given equation $K = o$ for D and P write respectively $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\\frac{y\\dot{x} \\pm x\\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{y^2 + x^2}}$, and there results a fluxional equation $L = o$ of the first order, of which the fluent expresses the general relation between $x$ and $y$.\n\nCor. If in the given equation for P be wrote $nP'$, there results the equation $K' = o$, which expresses the relation between the perpendicular Sy = P' and distance Sp = D' of every curve, which at equal distances has the same velocity and force tending to S; reduce the equations $K' = o$, $D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $nP' = \\frac{y\\dot{x} \\pm x\\dot{y}}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$ into one, so that D and P' may be exterminated, and there will result the same fluxional equation of the first order, expressing the relation between $x$, $y$, and their fluxions, whatever may be the value of $n$. The general fluent of this fluxional equation contains the relation between the absciss and ordinates of all curves, which have the same force and velocity at the same distance as the force and velocity in the given curve.\n\nPROP.\nPROP.

It is further to be observed, that resistances are always to be taken affirmatively.\n\nEx. 2. Let the accelerating force be as the arc, that is, the distance from the lowest point, and the resistance as the velocity; then will the fluxional equation \\((F - V)\\dot{A} = -v\\dot{v}\\) be \\((ax - v)\\dot{x} = -v\\dot{v}\\), which is an homogeneous equation of the first order: write in it \\(zx\\) for \\(v\\), and its fluxion for \\(\\dot{v}\\), and there results the equation \\((ax - zx)x\\dot{x} = -zx^2\\dot{x} - z^2x\\dot{x}\\), whence \\((a - z)\\dot{x} = -zx\\dot{x} - z^2\\dot{x}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\dot{x}}{x} = \\frac{-z\\dot{x}}{a - z + z^2}\\), and thence \\(\\log x = -\\frac{1}{2} \\log (a - z + z^2)(W) - \\frac{2}{4a - 1} \\times \\text{cir. arc, whose radius is } \\frac{\\sqrt{4a - 1}}{2} \\text{ and tangent } (z - \\frac{1}{2}) + B\\), whence can be found \\(v = ax\\), and from curvilinear areas \\(t = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{v}\\).\nIf \\(4a\\) is less than 1, then it becomes \\(\\log x = W - \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} - a}} \\times \\log \\frac{x - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} - a} - \\frac{1}{2}}{x + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} - a} - \\frac{1}{2}} + B\\); where \\(B\\) is an invariable quantity to be assumed according to the conditions of the problem.\n\nCor. If the force be directly as the distance, or as the arc of the curve from the body to the lowest point, and the resistance as the velocity; then will the velocity in one arc be to the velocity in the corresponding point of another arc, as the arcs to be described; and consequently the times equal.\n\n4. If the body is acted on by forces tending to points \\(S, S', S''\\), &c. situated in different planes, then let \\(F\\) be the sum of the forces in the direction of the tangent at the point \\(P\\); \\(F'\\) and \\(F''\\) the sum of the forces acting on the body in two different directions at the same point, which are not situated in the same plane with the tangent and each other; from the three equations \\((F + X'V)\\dot{A} = -vv\\) and \\(\\frac{v^2}{C} = \\frac{1}{2}F'\\) and \\(\\frac{v^2}{C} = \\frac{1}{2}F''\\), in which the same letters denote the same quantities as before, and \\(C\\) and \\(C'\\) denotes the chords of curvature in the same directions as the forces \\(F'\\) and \\(F''\\), which from the curve being given can be found at any point; and if \\(F'\\) or \\(F''\\) is given in terms of the distance from a given point, or an absciss or ordinate, &c. the velocity \\(v\\) can be found in terms of the same, and \\(X'V\\) by a simple algebraical equation: if \\(F'\\) is not given, and \\(V\\) is a given function of \\(v\\), substitute in \\(V\\) for \\(v\\) its value \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}C \\times F'}\\), and there results an equation expressing the relation between \\(F\\) (which can be deduced from \\(F'\\) or \\(F''\\)) and the distance of the body from some given point, or the abscissæ and ordinates of the curve required, and their fluxions.\nIf some of the forces act in parallel directions; the forces, velocities, &c. may be found by the same method.\n\n**Prop. X.**\n\nFig. 11. Let a body be projected in a direction HL with a given velocity, and be acted on by a force in a direction parallel to AP = x, which varies as X a function of x; and also by another force in a direction parallel to MP = y, that is, perpendicular to AP, which force varies as Y a function of y; and let it move in a medium, of which the resistance is proportional to the velocity; to find the curve described.\n\nFind the fluent of \\((X + av) \\dot{x} = -vv\\), which corrected according to the conditions of the problem (viz. so that \\(v\\) at the point H may be to the velocity of projection :: \\(Hc : Hb\\), where \\(bc\\) is drawn perpendicular to AP) suppose \\(v = X'\\); find the fluent of \\(\\frac{\\dot{x}}{x}\\), which corrected so as to become = 0, when \\(x = AH\\), let be \\(X''\\).

If the bodies \\(S, S', S''\\), &c. move in different planes, then all the forces acting on the body, except three, may be given, which may be acquired from the method given in the same proposition.\n\nHence it appears, that \\(2n\\) forces may be requisite to be found from the conditions of the problem to determine all the bodies to move in their respective curves, when they are all situated in the same plane, and that \\(3 \\times n\\) forces may be requisite in different planes, &c. if the force of one body \\((S')\\) on another \\((S'')\\) does not at all depend on the force of the same body \\((S')\\) on any other \\((S''')\\); and if the same can be predicated of the rest, then \\(n \\cdot n - 3\\) forces of the above mentioned bodies in the same, or \\(n \\cdot n - 4\\) forces in different planes may be assumed at will.\n3.

The same principles may be applied to determine the curves, when the bodies move in mediums, of which the resistances are given: for example, suppose the resistances to vary as a function of the distance from a given point into a function of the velocity: to the forces in the directions of the tangents contained in the preceding case must be added or subtracted the given resistances for the forces in the directions of the tangents, and the remaining process will be the same as is before given.\n\nIf two bodies describe similar orbits round a common center, either quiescent or moving uniformly in a right line; the forces and velocities and resistances of the medium will be to each other in correspondent points as their respective distances from the center.\n\n**PROP. XIII.**\n\nGiven the forces acting on any bodies, and tending to points either moveable or quiescent, or in the direction of the tangents, &c.; to find the curve described by one of the bodies.\n\n1. Assume \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) for the absciss and ordinate of the curve required, and from thence may be deduced the distances from any quiescent center of force, and consequently the force \\( f \\) in that direction; resolve it into two others, one in the direction of the tangent, and the other in a different one; for example, let it be in a direction perpendicular to the tangent, and from their fluxions \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\), and the force \\( f \\) may, by the method before\nbefore given, be deduced the forces in the two above mentioned directions; and in the same manner may be found from \\( x, y, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y} \\), the forces in the directions of the tangent and perpendicular to it, which follow from all the forces tending to given points, and acting on the body moving in the curve to be investigated.\n\n2. If some of the centers of force move in given curves \\( B, B', B'' \\), &c. whose arcs let be denoted by \\( B, B', &c. \\) and their respective places at the same time are given; then from their respective places given and forces, and \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\), can, as before, be deduced the forces in the direction of the tangent and its perpendicular to the curve required.\n\n3.
