  "text": "3 Inches perpendicular Height, above the horizontal Plane on which the Meridian Line was drawn.\n\nMr. Wheeler, at Otterden-Place, near Lenham in Kent, observed the Beginning at $5^h\\ 49'\\ 0''$, and the End at $7^h\\ 31'\\ 49''$. His Observations were made with a Telescope of 15 Feet in length, and his Time was also rectified by a Meridian Line; but it was done by a Transit of the Rays through an Hole at a much greater Height. For the Brass Plate in which the Hole was made was fix'd to a Window in the Roof of his Hall, at the Height of 27 Feet above the Meridian Line on the Floor.\n\nWith my humble Duty to the Royal Society, I remain,\n\nSir,\nYour humble Servant,\nStephen Gray.\n\nVI.

Milner, at Yeovil in Somersetshire, communicated in a Letter to Dr. John Allen, M.D. F.R.S.\n\nSIR,\n\nI Beg leave to present you with the Observations I made on the Eclipse May 2, viz.\n\nThe Beginning at $5^h\\ 34'\\ 00''\\ 17.\\degree\\ 45'$\n\nat 6. 00. 00 $13.\\degree\\ 36'$ Sun's Alt.\n\nEnd at 7. 14. 30 $2.\\degree\\ 45'$\n\nI made Use of a Quadrant 2 Feet radius.\n\nJ.
