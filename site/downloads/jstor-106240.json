The frost went away finely the beginning of February, and without much rain till the snow was almost gone; but a good deal of the middle of February was stormy and wet, and it was chiefly wet till about ten days in March, yet not cold. Then the season grew dry; the seed-time was fine, pleasant, growing warmer; and in the middle of April hot. There was great plenty of blossoms of all sorts, and the grass came on well; but the wheat, which had been left thin by the great frost and snow, was rather hurried on too fast. It grew colder at the end of April, and was cool and dry most part of May, with chiefly Northerly winds. During this time the wheat mended much, but rain began to be wanted, of which there came some in June, and brought on both corn and grass. The latter end of that month and July were only showery and hotter, so that the hay was got in well; and toward the end of July and beginning of August, the ground began to burn pretty much, when after some very hot days there came a great deal of wet.\n\nThe course of the seasons this year was I believe the same in all places. Dry spring and beginning of summer, showery June, drier July, very hot beginning of August,\nand wet after; but in different proportions in various places. In some, as Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, the drought so much prevailed that the ground was greatly burnt, and hay very scarce; on the other hand here and in Huntingdonshire, there were so many refreshing showers that we never were in want of grass.\n\nThe beginning of harvest was wet, and the rest showery. I believe a little of the wheat might grow, but in general the grain was pretty well got in. It was a remarkably plentiful year for almost all kinds of fruit; the crop of grain was pretty good, especially the barley; and there were great quantities of latter grass and turnips. In the middle of September the weather grew fairer; it was a fine latter end of the year and wheat feed-time, without too much rain intermixed. As the winter came on, it was chiefly calm, and there was much cloudy or misty weather, scarce any frosty mornings till near the end of November; a short frost then and mild again; but towards the latter half of December it began to be more inclined to frost, and the year ended with a sharp one, and pretty deep snow.",
