(the Horizon.\n\n2 14 44 The Duration.\n\nQuantity eclipsed 5 Dig. $\\frac{716}{1000}$\n\nI had very correct Observations both of the Sun and Stars, the 26, 27, and 28th, for determining the exact Time by my Clock.\n\nFor some Minutes before the Eclipse began, I observ'd the Sun with a Telescope of 12 Foot, furnished with a Micrometer; keeping that Part of the Limb in the middle of the Glass, where I expected the Moon first to touch, and in less than four Seconds of Time, from the Moment I judged the Eclipse begun, it was so considerably advanc'd, that I cannot doubt of having the Beginning to less than three Seconds. I believe the exact Time of ending was within the same Limit, notwithstanding that the Undulation of the Limb was then much greater than at the Beginning. The Parts eclipsed, measured with the Micrometer, at the Time of the greatest Obscuration, were 927 such Parts as the Sun's Vertical Diameter contained 1946; which was taken a little before the Beginning of the Eclipse.\n\nThe Sky was clear, and free from Clouds, till near the End, when a narrow one obscured some part of the Sun's Disk, but that part of the Limb where the Eclipse ended, continued clear till after it was over.\n\nBy\nBy this Observation the Beginning differed not 2\n½, and the End not ½ a Minute from Dr. Halley's Com-\nputation, which he sent me the Day before. And if his\nComputation, which was made for Greenwich, had\nbeen reduced to the Meridian of London, the Diffe-\nrence would have been still less.\n\nThe same Eclipse was observ'd by Mr. Hawkins at\nWakefield, in Yorkshire, to begin at 1 h. 21 m. p. m.\nand to end at 3 h. 30 m. 3 ⅛. The Sun's Diameter was\nobscured somewhat more than 5 Digits.\n\nIII. De Particulis & Structurâ Adamantum. Epis-\ntola Domini Antonii Leeuwenhoek, R. S. Soc.\nad Jacobum Jurin, M. D. R. S. Secret.\n\nPostquam investigando compereram Metalla quæ-\ndam, & ipsas etiam Arenas ex perexiguis ejus-\ndem materiae particulis compositas esse, meditatio-\nnem meam converti ad Adamantem; scilicet num ille\netiam ex istiusmodi constet particulis, quæ quidem ope\nmicroscopii conspici possint.\n\nIgitur exiguum quendam Adamantem per microsco-\npium contemplatus, in eâ Adamantis parte quæ polita\nnon erat, & splendore carebat, complures particulas\noculis observavi; & Adamantem ex parvis particulis\ncompositum esse comperi. Verum cum hæc nondum\nmihi satisfacerent; Adamantem in frusta confringere\ndecrevi, ut illum in fragmentis suis considerarem.\n\nErgo Adamantem, malleo impositum, alio malleo\nsemel iterumque percussi, qui sic percussus in quatuor\naut quinque frusta dissiliebat. Quod cum ronduum\nmihi satisfaceret, & Adamantem in exiguiissimas micu-\nlas comminuere vellem; frustum, quod cæteris majus\nK k 2 erat,",
