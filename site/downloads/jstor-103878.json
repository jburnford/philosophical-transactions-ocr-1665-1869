His distant Abode from London, and his not putting his Name to his Writings, made him not so universally known as the Boyle's, the Wilkins's, or the Oldenburg's of his Days, nor his Name handed down to us with such general Applause. In Concert with these and other learned Friends, (as he often revisited England) he was one of those, who first form'd the Plan of the Royal Society; and had not the Civil Wars happily ended as they did, Mr. Boyle* and Dr. Wilkins, with several other learned Men, would have left England, and, out of Esteem for the most excel-\n\n* As may appear in Letters from Mr. Boyle, Dr. Wilkins, Sir K. Digby, &c. to Mr. Winthrop.\nDEDICATION.\n\nlent and valuable Governor, JOHN WIN-\nTHROP the younger, would have retir'd to\nhis new-born Colony, and there have establish'd\nthat Society for promoting Natural Know-\nledge*, which these Gentlemen had formed,\nas it were, in Embryo among themselves; but\nwhich afterwards receiving the Protection of\nKing CHARLES II. obtain'd the Style\nof ROYAL, and hath since done so much\nHonour to the British Nations, as to be\nimitated by the several European Princes,\nwho desir'd to be esteem'd the Patrons of\nLearning.\n\nWHEN the Royal Society was thus founded,\nit was his constant Care to shew a peculiar\nRegard to promote the Design of its Institu-\ntion, by sending over many Specimens of\nthe curious natural Productions of those\nCountries, and by communicating in Writ-\ning his Remarks upon them; some of which\ngrace the earliest of our Transactions: And\nby a Letter from Mr. Oldenburg, written by\nOrder of the Royal Society, Mr. Winthrop\n\n* Which not taking place, his Father first founded the\nCollege at Cambridge in New-England, since known by the\nName of Harvard-College.\nDEDICATION.\n\nwas in a particular manner invited to take upon him the Charge of being the chief Correspondent of the Royal Society in the West, as Sir Philiberto Vernatti was in the East-Indies*.\n\nYou, Sir, have imitated the Example of your worthy Ancestor: Your Regard to the Royal Society shew'd itself from your Youth; you having sent to England many rare Curiosities for the Museum of the Royal Society, which, although by the Disingenuity of the Pilot they miss'd their Port, and were not laid up in the intended Repository, are some of them to be seen in a recent Museum now at Cambridge.\n\nWhen the Injustice and Ingratitude of a designing Party in Power among that very People, whereof the Winthropes have always been in the most strict Sense the Fathers, the Patres Patriæ, had most cruelly driven you from your Family\n\n* In a Letter from Mr. Oldenburg, Aug. 3, 1664.\nDEDICATION.\n\nand Native Soil, to seek Justice and Security in your natural Rights from the Hands of our most Gracious Sovereign; amidst the Vexation of the greatest Abuses, and the Hurries of the most sudden Departure, you were not unmindful of the Royal Society; for soon after your being chosen a Fellow, you increas'd the Riches of their Repository with above Six hundred curious Specimens, chiefly in the Mineral Kingdom, accompanied with a List containing an accurate Account of each Particular; thereby shewing your great Skill in natural Philosophy, and at the same time intimating to England the vast Riches which lie hidden in the Lap of her principal Daughter. Since Mr. Colwall, the Founder of the Museum of the Royal Society, you have been the Benefactor who has given the most numerous Collection; and it is to be hoped your generous Example will be followed by some of the present Members, by which means our Repository may soon become one of the most conspicuous in Europe.\n\nThe extraordinary Knowledge, you have in the deep Mysteries of the most secret Hermetic\nDEDICATION.\n\nmetic Science, will always make you esteemed and courted by learned and good Men; but I forbear to say any more, lest the Trouble I have given you by this long Address should be a Trespass upon your Patience; in which Case I know your Goodness will forgive me; and I hope you will be persuaded, that I am upon all Occasions, with the greatest Sincerity,\n\nSIR,\n\nDartmouth-street,\nWESTMINSTER,\nAugust 15. 1741.\n\nYour most affectionate Friend,\nand obliged humble Servant,\n\nCROMWELL MORTIMER, M.D.\nSecretary to the Royal Society, and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, LONDON.\nPHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS\n\nFor the Months of January, February, March, April, May and June, 1737.\n\nThe CONTENTS.\n\nI.
