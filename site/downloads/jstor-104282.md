IX. Extract of a Letter from the Hon'ble Henry Temple, Esq; to his Father the Right Hon'ble the Lord Viscount Palmerston, concerning an Earthquake at Naples; communicated to the Royal Society by Claudius Amyand, Esq; F.R.S. and Sergeant Surgeon to His MAJESTY.

SIR,

Norwich, Jan. 8. 1734-5.

I Herewith send you both a Draught and Description of a monstrous Birth, which I believe the Royal Society have had as yet no Account of; which gives me Hopes, that what I here send will prove the more acceptable to you.

Elizabeth Spencer, being tried at our Assizes for the City and County of Norwich, for Shop-lifting, and being found guilty of the Crime, received Sentence for Transportation; for respiting of which Sentence she pleaded her Belly, which Plea, as she was a married Woman, appearing what was very probable, she was favour'd by the Mayor and the other Magistrates, by being allowed the full Time that she said she had to go; at the Expiration of which she was delivered of a Child, which I saw a few Hours after
