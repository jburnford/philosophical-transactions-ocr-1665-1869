Bat. 1684, 12°.\n\nThe former, and greater part, of this Book, contains accounts of experiments on Dogs; in which we find the following Observations.\n\nA Mastiff bled five pound (Troy weight.) of blood, within the space of half an hour, at severall Artery.\n\nThe Ribs of a Dog were found more brittle near that end by which they are joyned to the Vertebrae, then at the other end.\n\nA needle being driven into the Brain of a Dog, between the first Vertebra, and the Os Occipitis, the Dog seem'd as if struck with an Epilepsy, and died in a little time.\n\nThe passage from the Pelvis into the Ureter of a Dog, being stopt, the Kidney of the opposite side was found larger than ordinary.\n\nSix veins being tied in a Dog (viz. the 2 Crurales, the 2 Axillares, and the externall Jugulars,) the Dog seem'd choak'd in a very little time; the Ligatures being loosed, and blood drawn, the breast moved again.\n\nA Procidentia Ani has been caus'd in a Dog, to the length of a foot. A Dog not much troubl'd at the pricking of the Meninges, was concern'd when the spinal marrow was peirc't. Experiments have been tried by the Author, with Tallow injected into the veins of Dogs.\n\nThe Vena Mammaria have been observed to communicate with the Epigastrica in a Bitch; for blood was easily pressed from the former into the latter, and back again.\n\nA Phial, which, when fill'd, contain'd a pound of rain-water, held one pound and one ounce of Venose blood, of\nArteriose blood, and of serum taken promiscuously from both sorts of blood; but it held one pound one ounce and half of grumose blood, clear'd of the serum.\n\nThe Author affirms that no Lacteals arise either from the stomach, or Intestina Graffa.\n\nValves are observ'd in the farther part of the Ductus Thoracicus, near its ending in the Subclavial Vein; contrary to what is affirm'd by some Anatomists.\n\nThe Valves, lying in pairs in the Ductus Thoracicus, are generally an Inch and half one pair from another. One Kidney has been found 8 times bigger and heavier, in a Dog, then the other.\n\nThe Author affirms that the Lacteals impart no Liquor to the Pancreas Asellii.\n\nTheir Origine has been traced as far as the Glandulose Tunic of the Intestines.\n\nThere are severall other observations mentioned, concerning the Lacteals, the Ductus Thoracicus, and the valve at the end of it; beside all which the Publisher of this book, Ernestus Gotfried Heyseus of Dantzig, affiures us, that the learned Author has a vast stock of Observations by him; which very much advance Physiological, and Pathological Physic, and as such cannot but be very welcome to the Curious Reader, when ever the Author shall think fit to present them to the world.\n\nThere follow severall Quæries de Semine Virili; de Fæmineis Ovis, vel in Ovario, vel extra; de Útero: to which are subjoyned some Corollarys concerning the Human Fætus, whom he will not allow to have a Allantois, or Urachus.\n\nERRATA.\n\nPag. 862 line 2 for Loir read Les. pag. 863 line 12, for Mago, read Mayo. pag. 888 line 25 for anatomized read anatom red. line penult read th. u. fand million of pars. pag. 893 line 21 for from read from. pag. 894 line 25 for after read after. pag. 920 line ult read absolutely. pag. 919 read intelligible. pag. 921 line 16 read obseruatis. page 923 line 8 for was read as. pag. 924 line 32 for Campo read Campi pag. 928 line 29 read containing. pag. 932, line 7, read hard frost.\n\nPrinted at the Theatre in Oxford, for Sam.
