It tore up the Dead out of their Graves; at first I was willing to believe it only of an old Woman that had been buried that Afternoon, and so the Earth not fully settled again; but am since informed by a sure hand, that two corrupted Corpses were driven upon one Gentleman's Land, and as many upon another's. It swept away all the Corn-Land, as deep as the Plow had gone. Some Persons sav'd themselves by forcing a Way out of the Roofs of their Houses, and sitting upon the Ridges till the Floods abated.\n\nI was that Day seiz'd by a smart Thunder-Shower, upon the Moor, as I was coming home.\n\nLeeds, June 5.\n1722.\n\nV. Part of a Letter from Mons. Couzier, Physician in the Infirmaries at Alais, to Dr. Deidier, Professor of Chymistry in the University of Montpelier, concerning a new Experiment made with the Blood of a Person dead of the Plague. Communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. Woodward, F.R.S. Prof. Med. Gresh.\n\nOn the First of this Month I took an Opportunity of beginning the Experiments you had recommended to me, and of which I had promised to give you an Account.\nI took a Quantity of Blood from the Body of a Person dead of the Plague, and mix'd it with warm Water, which Mixture I attempted to inject into the Crucial Vein of a Dog, but the End of the Syringe being too large to enter the Vein, the Experiment did not succeed.\n\nThis made me resolve to try the other Method you had proposed to me, which was to lay some of the same infected Blood upon the Wound. This I accordingly did, and cover'd it with a Dressing, which the Dog got off in the Night. I found the next Morning that the Dog had lick'd his Wound, and that he refused his Food. Towards Night he began to bemoan himself, and gave Signs of an approaching Death. The next Morning I found him dead, the Wound being considerably swell'd and gangren'd, and the Edges round the Swelling were likewise gangrened.\n\nUpon opening the Body we found the Liver something larger than usual, with Spots of a livid Purple, as in the Bodies of Persons dead of the Plague. In the Stomach was found a Quantity of black coagulated Blood, of the Size of a Hen's Egg. This in all Likelihood was what he had swallow'd upon licking the Wound. The Heart was very large, with a black grumous Blood in the Ventricles, and the Auricles were turn'd blackish and gangrenous.\n\nAlais, April 3.\n1722.\n\nVI. Ex-",
