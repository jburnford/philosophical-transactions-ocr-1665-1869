  "text": "XXIII. A Fifth Memoir upon Quantics. By Arthur Cayley, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nReceived February 11,—Read March 18, 1858.\n\nThe present memoir was originally intended to contain a development of the theories of the covariants of certain binary quantics, viz. the quadric, the cubic, and the quartic; but as regards the theories of the cubic and the quartic, it was found necessary to consider the case of two or more quadrics, and I have therefore comprised such systems of two or more quadrics, and the resulting theories of the harmonic relation and of involution, in the subject of the memoir; and although the theory of homography or of the anharmonic relation belongs rather to the subject of bipartite binary quadrics, yet from its connexion with the theories just referred to, it is also considered in the memoir. The paragraphs are numbered continuously with those of my former memoirs on the subject: Nos. 92 to 95 relate to a single quadric; Nos. 96 to 114 to two or more quadrics, and the theories above referred to; Nos. 115 to 127 to the cubic, and Nos. 128 to 145 to the quartic. The several quantics are considered as expressed not only in terms of the coefficients, but also in terms of the roots,—and I consider the question of the determination of their linear factors,—a question, in effect, identical with that of the solution of a quadric, cubic, or biquadratic equation. The expression for the linear factor of a quadric is deduced from a well-known formula; those for the linear factors of a cubic and a quartic were first given in my \"Note sur les Covariants d'une fonction quadratique, cubique ou biquadratique à deux indéterminées,\" Crelle, vol. L. pp. 285 to 287, 1855. It is remarkable that they are in one point of view more simple than the expression for the linear factor of a quadric.\n\n92. In the case of a quadric the expressions considered are\n\n\\[\n(a, b, c)(x, y)^2, \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nac - b^2, \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nwhere (1) is the quadric, and (2) is the discriminant, which is also the quadrinvariant, catalecticant, and Hessian.\n\nAnd where it is convenient to do so, I write\n\n\\[\n(1) = U,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(2) = \\square.\n\\]\n\n93. We have\n\n\\[\n(\\partial_a, -\\partial_b, \\partial_c)(x, y)^2 \\square = U,\n\\]\n\nwhich expresses that the evectant of the discriminant is equal to the quadric;\n\\[(a, b, c \\chi \\partial_y, -\\partial_x)^2 U = 4 \\Box,\\]\n\nwhich expresses that the provectant of the quadric is equal to the discriminant;\n\n\\[(a, b, c \\chi bx + cy, -ax - by)^2 = \\Box U,\\]\n\nwhich expresses that a transmutant of the quadric is equal to the product of the quadric and the discriminant.\n\n94. When the quadric is expressed in terms of the roots, we have\n\n\\[a^{-1} U = (x - \\alpha y)(x - \\beta y),\\]\n\n\\[a^{-2} \\Box = -\\frac{1}{4}(\\alpha - \\beta)^2;\\]\n\nand in the case of a pair of equal roots,\n\n\\[a^{-1} U = (x - \\alpha y)^2,\\]\n\n\\[\\Box = 0.\\]\n\n95. The problem of the solution of a quadratic equation is that of finding a linear factor of the quadric. To obtain such linear factor in a symmetrical form, it is necessary to introduce arbitrary quantities which do not really enter into the solution, and the form obtained is thus in some sort more complicated than in the like problem for a cubic or a quartic. The solution depends on the linear transformation of the quadric, viz. if we write\n\n\\[(a, b, c \\chi \\lambda x + \\mu y, \\nu x + \\varepsilon y)^2 = (a', b', c' \\chi x, y)^2,\\]\n\nso that\n\n\\[a' = (a, b, c \\chi \\lambda, \\nu)^2,\\]\n\n\\[b' = (a, b, c \\chi \\lambda, \\varepsilon)^2,\\]\n\n\\[c' = (a, b, c \\chi \\mu, \\varepsilon)^2,\\]\n\nthen\n\n\\[a'c' - b'^2 = (ac - b^2)(\\lambda \\varepsilon - \\mu \\nu)^2,\\]\n\nan equation which in a different notation is\n\n\\[(a, b, c \\chi x, y)^2 \\cdot (a, b, c \\chi X, Y)^2 - (a, b, c \\chi x, y \\chi X, Y)^2 = \\Box (Yx - Xy)^2,\\]\n\nin which form it is a theorem relating to the quadric and its first and second emanants. The equation shows that\n\n\\[(a, b, c \\chi x, y \\chi X, Y) + \\sqrt{-\\Box} (Yx - Xy),\\]\n\nwhere \\((X, Y)\\) are treated as supernumerary arbitrary constants, is a linear factor of \\((a, b, c \\chi x, y)^2\\), and this is the required solution.\n\n96. In the case of two quadrics, the expressions considered are\n\n\\[(a, b, c \\chi x, y)^2,\\] \\hspace{1cm} (1)\n\n\\[(a', b', c' \\chi x, y)^2,\\] \\hspace{1cm} (2)\n\n\\[ac - b^2,\\] \\hspace{1cm} (3)\n\n\\[a'c' - 2bb' + ca',\\] \\hspace{1cm} (4)\n\n\\[a'a' - b'^2,\\] \\hspace{1cm} (5)\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n(a'b - a'b', ac' - a'c', bc' - b'c) \\quad (x, y)^2, \\\\\n(\\lambda a + \\mu a', \\lambda b + \\mu b', \\lambda c + \\mu c') \\quad (x, y)^2, \\\\\n(ac - b^2, ac' - 2bb' + cc', a'c' - b'^2) \\quad (\\lambda, \\mu)^2,\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n(1) and (2) are the quadrics, (3) and (5) are the discriminants, and (4) is the lineo-linear invariant, or connective of the discriminants; (6) is the resultant of the two quadrics, (7) is the Jacobian, (8) is an intermediate, and (9) is the discriminant of the intermediate. And where it is convenient to do so, I write\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1) &= U, \\\\\n(2) &= U', \\\\\n(3) &= \\Box, \\\\\n(4) &= Q, \\\\\n(5) &= \\Box', \\\\\n(6) &= R, \\\\\n(7) &= H, \\\\\n(8) &= W, \\\\\n(9) &= \\Theta.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n97. The Jacobian (7) may also be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny^2, -yx, x^2 \\\\\na, b, c \\\\\na', b', c'\n\\end{vmatrix},\n\\]\n\nThe Resultant (6) may be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\na, 2b, c \\\\\na, 2b, c \\\\\na', 2b', c' \\\\\na', 2b', c'\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n\\]\nand also, taken negatively, in the form\n\n\\[4(ab' - ab)(bc' - bc) - (ac' - ac)^2,\\]\n\nwhich is the discriminant of the Jacobian; and in the form\n\n\\[4(ac - b^2)(a'c' - b'^2) - (ac' - 2bb' + ca')^2,\\]\n\nwhich is the discriminant of the Intermediate.\n\n98. We have the following relations:\n\n\\[(a, b, c)\\chi bx + cy, - ax - by)^2 = \\]\n\\[-(a'c' - b'^2) \\quad (a, b, c)\\chi x, y)^2\\]\n\\[-(ac - b^2) \\quad (a', b', c')\\chi x, y)^2,\\]\n\n\\[(a', b', c')\\chi bx + cy, - ax - by)^2 = \\]\n\\[-(ac' - 2bb' + ca') \\quad (a, b, c)\\chi x, y)^2\\]\n\\[-(ac - b^2) \\quad (a', b', c')\\chi x, y)^2,\\]\n\nand, moreover,\n\n\\[(ac - b^2, ac' - 2bb' + ca', a'c' - b'^2)\\chi U', - U)^2\\]\n\\[= -\\{(ab' - ab, ac' - ac, bc' - bc)\\chi x, y)^2\\}^2,\\]\n\nan equation, the interpretation of which will be considered in the sequel.\n\n99. The most important relations which may exist between the two quadrics are—\n\nFirst, when the connective vanishes, or\n\n\\[ac' - 2bb' + ca' = 0,\\]\n\nin which case the two quadrics are said to be harmonically related: the nature of this relation will be further considered.\n\nSecondly, when \\(R = 0\\), the two quadrics have in this case a common root, which is given by any of the equations,\n\n\\[x^2 : 2xy : y^2 = \\partial_a R : \\partial_b R : \\partial_c R\\]\n\\[= \\partial_a R : \\partial_b R : \\partial_c R\\]\n\\[= bc' - bc : ca' - ca : ab' - ab.\\]\n\nThe last set of values express that the Jacobian is a perfect square, and that the two roots are each equal to the common root of the two quadrics.\n\nThe preceding values of the ratios \\(x^2 : 2xy : y^2\\) are consistent with each other in virtue of the assumed relation \\(R = 0\\), hence in general the functions\n\n\\[4\\partial_a R \\cdot \\partial_c R - (\\partial_b R)^2, \\quad \\partial_a R \\cdot \\partial_b R - \\partial_b R \\cdot \\partial_c R, \\quad \\text{&c.}\\]\n\nall of them contain the Resultant \\(R\\) as a factor.\n\nIt is easy to see that the Jacobian is harmonically related to each of the quadrics; in fact we have identically\n\n\\[a(bc' - bc) + b(ca' - ca) + c(ab' - ab) = 0,\\]\n\\[a'(bc' - bc) + b'(ca' - ca) + c'(ab' - ab) = 0,\\]\n\nwhich contain the theorem in question.\n100. When the quadrics are expressed in terms of the roots, we have\n\n\\[ a^{-1}U = (x - \\alpha y)(x - \\beta y), \\]\n\\[ a'^{-1}U' = (x - \\alpha'y)(x - \\beta'y), \\]\n\\[ 4a^{-2}\\square = -(\\alpha - \\beta)^2, \\]\n\\[ 2(aa')^{-1}Q = 2\\alpha\\beta + 2\\alpha'\\beta' - (\\alpha + \\beta)(\\alpha' + \\beta'), \\]\n\\[ 4a'^{-2}\\square' = -(\\alpha' - \\beta')^2, \\]\n\\[ (aa')^{-2}R = (\\alpha - \\alpha')(\\alpha - \\beta')(\\beta - \\alpha')(\\beta - \\beta'), \\]\n\\[ (ad')^{-1}H = \\begin{vmatrix} y^2 & 2yx & x^2 \\\\ 1 & \\alpha + \\beta & \\alpha\\beta \\\\ 1 & \\alpha' + \\beta' & \\alpha'\\beta' \\end{vmatrix}, \\]\n\n101. The comparison of the last-mentioned value of \\( R \\) with the expression in terms of the roots obtained from the equation\n\n\\[ -R = 4\\square\\square' - Q^2, \\]\n\ngives the identical equation\n\n\\[ (\\alpha - \\beta)^2(\\alpha' - \\beta')^2 - \\{2\\alpha\\beta + 2\\alpha'\\beta' - (\\alpha + \\beta)(\\alpha' + \\beta')\\}^2 = -4(\\alpha - \\alpha')(\\alpha - \\beta')(\\beta - \\alpha')(\\beta - \\beta'), \\]\n\nwhich may be easily verified.\n\n102. We have identically\n\n\\[ 2\\alpha\\beta + 2\\alpha'\\beta' - (\\alpha + \\beta)(\\alpha' + \\beta') \\]\n\\[ = 2(\\alpha - \\alpha')(\\alpha - \\beta') - (\\alpha - \\beta)(2\\alpha - \\alpha' - \\beta') \\]\n\\[ = 2(\\beta - \\alpha')(\\beta - \\beta') - (\\beta - \\alpha)(2\\beta - \\alpha' - \\beta') \\]\n\\[ = 2(\\alpha' - \\alpha)(\\alpha' - \\beta) - (\\alpha' - \\beta')(2\\alpha' - \\alpha - \\beta) \\]\n\\[ = 2(\\beta' - \\alpha)(\\beta' - \\beta) - (\\beta' - \\alpha')(2\\beta' - \\alpha - \\beta); \\]\n\nand the equation \\( Q = ac' - 2bb' + ca' = 0 \\) may consequently be written in the several forms\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{\\alpha - \\beta} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha - \\alpha'} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha - \\beta'}, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2}{\\beta - \\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha'} + \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\beta'}, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2}{\\alpha' - \\beta'} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha' - \\alpha} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha' - \\beta}, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2}{\\beta' - \\alpha'} = \\frac{1}{\\beta' - \\alpha} + \\frac{1}{\\beta' - \\beta}, \\]\n\nso that the roots \\((\\alpha, \\beta), (\\alpha', \\beta')\\) are harmonically related to each other, and hence the notion of the harmonic relation of the two quadrics.\n\n103. In the case where the two quadrics have a common root \\( \\alpha = \\alpha' \\),\n\n\\[ a^{-1}U = (x - \\alpha y)(x - \\beta y), \\]\n\\[ a'^{-1}U' = (x - \\alpha y)(x - \\beta'y), \\]\n\\[4\\alpha^{-2} \\Box = -(\\alpha - \\beta)^2,\\]\n\\[2(aa')^{-1}Q = (\\alpha - \\beta)(\\alpha - \\beta'),\\]\n\\[4\\alpha'^{-2} \\Box' = (\\alpha - \\beta')^2,\\]\n\\[R = 0\\]\n\\[(aa')^{-1}H = (\\beta' - \\beta)(x - \\alpha y)^2.\\]\n\n104. In the case of three quadrics, of the expressions which are or might be considered, it will be sufficient to mention\n\n\\[(a, b, c) \\chi(x, y)^2,\\] (1)\n\\[(a', b', c') \\chi(x, y)^2,\\] (2)\n\\[(a'', b'', c'') \\chi(x, y)^2,\\] (3)\n\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\na' & b' & c' \\\\\na'' & b'' & c''\n\\end{vmatrix},\\] (4)\n\nwhere (1), (2), (3) are the quadrics themselves, and (4) is an invariant, linear in the coefficients of each quadric. And where it is convenient to do so, I write\n\n\\[(1) = U,\\]\n\\[(2) = U',\\]\n\\[(3) = U'',\\]\n\\[(4) = \\Omega.\\]\n\n105. The equation \\(\\Omega = 0\\) is, it is clear, the condition to be satisfied by the coefficients of the three quadrics, in order that there may be a syzygetic relation \\(\\lambda U + \\mu U' + \\nu U'' = 0\\), or what is the same thing, in order that each quadric may be an intermediate of the other two quadrics; or again, in order that the three quadrics may be in Involution.\n\nExpressed in terms of the roots, the relation is\n\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, \\alpha + \\beta, \\alpha \\beta \\\\\n1, \\alpha' + \\beta', \\alpha' \\beta' \\\\\n1, \\alpha'' + \\beta'', \\alpha'' \\beta''\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0;\\]\n\nand when this equation is satisfied, the three pairs, or as it is usually expressed, the six quantities \\(\\alpha, \\beta; \\alpha', \\beta'; \\alpha'', \\beta''\\), are said to be in involution, or to form an involution.\n\nAnd the two perfectly arbitrary pairs \\(\\alpha, \\beta; \\alpha', \\beta'\\) considered as belonging to such a system, may be spoken of as an involution. If the two terms of a pair are equal, e.g., if \\(\\alpha'' = \\beta'' = 0\\), then the relation is\n\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, 2\\theta, \\theta^2 \\\\\n1, \\alpha + \\beta, \\alpha \\beta \\\\\n1, \\alpha' + \\beta', \\alpha' \\beta'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0;\\]\n\nand such a system is sometimes spoken of as an involution of five terms. Considering\nthe pairs \\((\\alpha, \\beta), (\\alpha', \\beta')\\) as given, there are of course two values of \\(\\theta\\) which satisfy the preceding equation; and calling these \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\), then \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are said to be the sibiconjugates of the involution \\(\\alpha, \\beta; \\alpha', \\beta'\\). It is easy to see that \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) are the roots of the equation \\(H = 0\\), where \\(H\\) is the Jacobian of the two quadrics \\(U\\) and \\(U'\\) whose roots are \\((\\alpha, \\beta), (\\alpha', \\beta')\\). In fact, the quadric whose roots are \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny^2 & 2yx & x^2 \\\\\n1 & \\alpha + \\beta & \\alpha \\beta \\\\\n1 & \\alpha' + \\beta' & \\alpha' \\beta'\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwhich has been shown to be the Jacobian in question. But this may be made clearer as follows:—If we imagine that \\(\\lambda, \\mu\\) are determined in such manner that the intermediate \\(\\lambda U + \\mu U'\\) may be a perfect square, then we shall have \\(\\lambda U + \\mu U' = a''(x - \\theta y)^2\\), where \\(\\theta\\) denotes one or other of the sibiconjugates \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) of the involution. But the condition in order that \\(\\lambda U + \\mu U'\\) may be a square is\n\n\\[\n(ac - b^2, ac' - 2bb' + ca', a'c' - b'^2)(\\lambda, \\mu)^2;\n\\]\n\nand observing that the equation \\(\\lambda : \\mu = U : U'\\) implies \\(\\lambda U + \\mu U' = 0 = a''(x - \\theta y)^2\\), it is obvious that the function\n\n\\[\n(ac - b^2, ac' - 2bb' + ca', a'c' - b'^2)(U', - U)^2\n\\]\n\nmust be to a factor près equal to \\((x - \\theta y)^2(x - \\theta y)^2\\). But we have identically\n\n\\[\n(ac - b^2, ac' - 2bb' + ca', a'c' - b'^2)(U', - U)^2 = -(ab' - db, ac' - a'c, bc' - b'c)(x, y)^2,\n\\]\n\nand we thus see that \\((x - \\theta y), (x - \\theta y)\\) are the factors of the Jacobian.\n\n106. It has been already remarked that the Jacobian is harmonically related to each of the quadrics \\(U, U'\\); hence we see that the sibiconjugates \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) of the involution \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\alpha', \\beta'\\) are a pair harmonically related to the pair \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\), and also harmonically related to the pair \\(\\alpha', \\beta'\\), and this properly might be taken as the definition for the sibiconjugates \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) of an involution of four terms. And moreover, \\(\\alpha, \\beta; \\alpha', \\beta'\\) being given, and \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) being determined as the sibiconjugates of the involution, if \\(\\alpha'', \\beta''\\) be a pair harmonically related to \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\), then the three pairs \\(\\alpha, \\beta; \\alpha', \\beta'; \\alpha'', \\beta''\\) will form an involution; or what is the same thing, any three pairs \\(\\alpha, \\beta; \\alpha', \\beta'; \\alpha'', \\beta''\\), each of them harmonically related to a pair \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\), will be an involution, and \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) will be the sibiconjugates of the involution.\n\n107. In particular, if \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\) be harmonically related to \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\), then it is easy to see that \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\) may be considered as harmonically related to \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\), and in like manner \\(\\theta_2, \\theta_2\\) will be harmonically related to \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\); that is, the pairs \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2; \\theta_2, \\theta_2\\) and \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\) will form an involution. This comes to saying that the equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 2\\theta_1 & \\theta_2 \\\\\n1 & 2\\theta_2 & \\theta_2 \\\\\n1 & \\alpha + \\beta & \\alpha \\beta\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n\\]\nis equivalent to the harmonic relation of the pairs \\( \\alpha, \\beta; \\theta_1, \\theta_{ii} \\); and in fact the determinant is\n\n\\[\n(\\theta_1 - \\theta_{ii})(2\\alpha\\beta + 2\\theta_1\\theta_{ii} - (\\alpha + \\beta)(\\theta_1 + \\theta_{ii})),\n\\]\n\nwhich proves the theorem in question.\n\n108. Before proceeding further, it is proper to consider the equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & \\alpha, & \\alpha', & \\alpha\\alpha' \\\\\n1, & \\beta, & \\beta', & \\beta\\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\gamma, & \\gamma', & \\gamma\\gamma' \\\\\n1, & \\delta, & \\delta', & \\delta\\delta'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich expresses that the sets \\((\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)\\) and \\((\\alpha', \\beta', \\gamma', \\delta')\\) are homographic; for although the homographic equation may be considered as belonging to the theory of the bipartite quadric \\((x - \\alpha y)(x - \\alpha'y)\\), yet the theory of involution cannot be completely discussed except in connexion with that of homography. If we write\n\n\\[\nA = (\\beta - \\gamma)(\\alpha - \\delta), \\quad B = (\\gamma - \\alpha)(\\beta - \\delta), \\quad C = (\\alpha - \\beta)(\\gamma - \\delta),\n\\]\n\\[\nA' = (\\beta' - \\gamma')(a' - b'), \\quad B' = (\\gamma' - \\alpha')(b' - \\delta'), \\quad C' = (\\alpha' - \\beta')(y' - \\delta'),\n\\]\n\nthen we have\n\n\\[\nA + B + C = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\nA' + B' + C' = 0,\n\\]\n\nand thence\n\n\\[\nBC' - B'C = CA' - C'A = AB' - A'B;\n\\]\n\nand either of these expressions is in fact equal to the last-mentioned determinant, as may be easily verified. Hence, when the determinant vanishes, we have\n\n\\[\nA : B : C = A' : B' : C'.\n\\]\n\nAny one of the three ratios \\(A : B : C\\), for instance the ratio \\(B : C =\\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\gamma - \\alpha)(\\beta - \\delta)}{(\\alpha - \\beta)(\\gamma - \\delta)},\n\\]\n\nis said to be the anharmonic ratio of the set \\((\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)\\), and consequently the two sets \\((\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)\\) and \\((\\alpha', \\beta', \\gamma', \\delta')\\) will be homographically related when the anharmonic ratios (that is, the corresponding anharmonic ratios) of the two sets are equal.\n\nIf any one of the anharmonic ratios be equal to unity, then the four terms of the set taken in a proper manner in pairs, will be harmonics; thus the equation \\(\\frac{B}{C} = 1\\) gives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\gamma - \\alpha)(\\beta - \\delta)}{(\\alpha - \\beta)(\\gamma - \\delta)} = 1,\n\\]\n\nwhich is reducible to\n\n\\[\n2\\alpha\\delta + 2\\beta\\gamma - (\\alpha + \\delta)(\\beta + \\gamma) = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich expresses that the pairs \\(\\alpha, \\delta\\) and \\(\\beta, \\gamma\\) are harmonics.\n\n109. Now returning to the theory of involution (and for greater convenience taking \\(\\alpha, \\alpha'\\) &c. instead of \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\) &c. to represent the terms of the same pair), the pairs \\(\\alpha, \\alpha'; \\beta, \\beta'\\);\nγ, γ′; δ, δ′ &c. will be in involution if each of the determinants formed with any three lines of the matrix\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1, & \\quad \\alpha + \\alpha', \\quad \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n1, & \\quad \\beta + \\beta', \\quad \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\quad \\gamma + \\gamma', \\quad \\gamma \\gamma' \\\\\n1, & \\quad \\delta + \\delta', \\quad \\delta \\delta' \\\\\n& \\quad \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nvanishes: but this being so, the determinant\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & \\alpha, & \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n1, & \\beta, & \\beta', & \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\gamma, & \\gamma', & \\gamma \\gamma' \\\\\n1, & \\delta, & \\delta', & \\delta \\delta'\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwhich is equal to\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\alpha, & 1, & \\alpha + \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n\\beta, & 1, & \\beta + \\beta', & \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n\\gamma, & 1, & \\gamma + \\gamma', & \\gamma \\gamma' \\\\\n\\delta, & 1, & \\delta + \\delta', & \\delta \\delta'\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwill vanish, or the two sets (α, β, γ, δ) and (α′, β′, γ′, δ′) will be homographic; that is, if any number of pairs are in involution, then, considering four pairs and selecting in any manner a term out of each pair, these four terms and the other terms of the same four pairs form respectively two sets, the two sets so obtained will be homographic.\n\n110. In particular, if we have only three pairs α, α′; β, β′; γ, γ′, then the sets α, β, γ, α′ and α′, β′, γ′, α will be homographic; in fact, the condition of homography is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & \\alpha, & \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n1, & \\beta, & \\beta', & \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\gamma, & \\gamma', & \\gamma \\gamma' \\\\\n1, & \\alpha', & \\alpha, & \\alpha \\alpha'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich may be written\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\alpha, & 1, & \\alpha + \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n\\beta, & 1, & \\beta + \\beta', & \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n\\gamma, & 1, & \\gamma + \\gamma', & \\gamma \\gamma' \\\\\n\\alpha', & 1, & \\alpha + \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\n\nor what is the same thing,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\alpha, & 1, & \\alpha + \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n\\beta, & 1, & \\beta + \\beta', & \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n\\gamma, & 1, & \\gamma + \\gamma', & \\gamma \\gamma' \\\\\n\\alpha' - \\alpha, & 0, & 0, & 0\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\nso that the first-mentioned relation is equivalent to\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n(\\alpha' - \\alpha) & 1, & \\alpha + \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n1, & \\beta + \\beta', & \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\gamma + \\gamma', & \\gamma \\gamma'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand the two sets give rise to an involution. The condition of homography as expressed by the equality of the anharmonic ratios may be written\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{\\alpha - \\gamma}, \\frac{\\gamma - \\alpha'}{\\alpha' - \\beta'}, \\frac{\\alpha' - \\beta'}{\\alpha' - \\gamma'}, \\frac{\\gamma' - \\alpha}{\\alpha - \\beta};\n\\]\n\nor multiplying out,\n\n\\[\n(\\alpha - \\beta)(\\alpha' - \\beta')(\\alpha - \\gamma)(\\alpha' - \\gamma') - (\\alpha - \\beta)(\\alpha' - \\beta')(\\alpha - \\gamma)(\\alpha' - \\gamma') = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is a form for the equation of involution of the three pairs. But this and the other transformations of the equation of involution is best obtained by a different method, as will be presently seen.\n\n111. Imagine now any number of pairs \\( \\alpha, \\alpha'; \\beta, \\beta'; \\gamma, \\gamma'; \\delta, \\delta' \\), &c. in involution, and let \\( x, y, z, w \\) be the fourth harmonics of the same quantity \\( \\lambda \\) with respect to the pairs \\( \\alpha, \\alpha'; \\beta, \\beta'; \\gamma, \\gamma' \\) and \\( \\delta, \\delta' \\) respectively; then the anharmonic ratios of the set \\((x, y, z, w)\\) will be independent of \\( \\lambda \\), or what is the same thing, if \\( x', y', z', w' \\) are the fourth harmonics of any other quantity \\( \\lambda' \\) with respect to the same four pairs, the sets \\((x, y, z, w)\\) and \\((x', y', z', w')\\) will be homographic, or we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & x, & x', & xx' \\\\\n1, & y, & y', & yy' \\\\\n1, & z, & z', & zz' \\\\\n1, & w, & w', & ww'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0.\n\\]\n\nIt will be sufficient to show this in the case where \\( \\lambda \\) is anything whatever, but \\( \\lambda' \\) has a determinate value, say \\( \\lambda' = \\infty \\); and since if all the terms \\( \\alpha, \\alpha', \\&c. \\) are diminished by the same quantity \\( \\lambda \\) the relations of involution and homography will not be affected, we may without loss of generality assume \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), but in this case\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2aa'}{\\alpha + \\alpha'}, \\quad x' = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha + \\alpha'),\n\\]\n\nand the equation to be proved is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & \\frac{\\alpha \\alpha'}{\\alpha + \\alpha'}, & \\alpha + \\alpha', & \\alpha \\alpha' \\\\\n1, & \\frac{\\beta \\beta'}{\\beta + \\beta'}, & \\beta + \\beta', & \\beta \\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\frac{\\gamma \\gamma'}{\\gamma + \\gamma'}, & \\gamma + \\gamma', & \\gamma \\gamma' \\\\\n1, & \\frac{\\delta \\delta'}{\\delta + \\delta'}, & \\delta + \\delta', & \\delta \\delta'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is obviously a consequence of the equations which express the involution of the four pairs.\nA set homographic with \\( x, y, z, w \\), which are the fourth harmonics of any quantity whatever \\( \\lambda \\) with respect to the pairs in involution, \\( \\alpha, \\alpha' ; \\beta, \\beta' ; \\gamma, \\gamma' ; \\delta, \\delta' \\), is said to be homographic with the four pairs, and we have thus the notion of a set of single quantities homographic with a set of pairs in involution. This very important theory is due to M. Chasles.\n\n112. Let \\( r; s; t \\) be the anharmonic ratios of a set \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta \\), and let \\( r_i; s_i; t_i \\) be the anharmonic ratios (corresponding or not corresponding) of a set \\( \\alpha_r, \\beta_r, \\gamma_r, \\delta_r \\). And suppose that \\( r'; s'; t'; r''; s''; t''; r'''; s'''; t'''; r''''; s''''; t'''' \\) are the analogous quantities for three other pairs of sets; then an equation such as\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & \\frac{r}{s}, & \\frac{r}{s_i}, & \\frac{rr_i}{ss_i} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\n\nor as it is more conveniently written,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nss_i, & rs_i, & rr_i, & rr_i \\\\\nss'_i, & rs'_i, & rr'_i, & rr'_i \\\\\nss''_i, & rs''_i, & rr''_i, & rr''_i \\\\\nss'''_i, & rs'''_i, & rr'''_i, & rr'''_i \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n\\]\n\nis a relation independent of the particular ratios \\( r:s \\) which have been chosen for the anharmonic ratios of the sets; this is easily shown by means of the equations\n\n\\[\nr + s + t = 0, \\quad r_i + s_i + t_i = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich connect the anharmonic ratios. The equation in fact expresses a certain relation between four sets \\( (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta) \\) and four other sets \\( (\\alpha_r, \\beta_r, \\gamma_r, \\delta_r) \\); a relation which may be termed the relation of the homography of the anharmonic ratios of four and four sets: the notion of this relation is also due to M. Chasles.\n\n113. The general relation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & \\alpha + \\beta, & \\alpha \\beta \\\\\n1, & \\alpha' + \\beta', & \\alpha' \\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\alpha'' + \\beta'', & \\alpha'' \\beta''\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n\\]\n\nmay be exhibited in a great variety of forms. In fact, if the determinant is denoted by \\( \\Upsilon \\), then multiplying by this determinant the two sides of the identical equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nu^2, & -u, & 1 \\\\\nv^2, & -v, & 1 \\\\\nw^2, & -w, & 1\n\\end{vmatrix} = (u-v)(v-w)(w-u),\n\\]\n\nwe obtain\n\n\\[\n\\Upsilon(u-v)(v-w)(w-u) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n(u-\\alpha)(u-\\beta), & (v-\\alpha)(v-\\beta), & (w-\\alpha)(w-\\beta) \\\\\n(u-\\alpha')(u-\\beta'), & (v-\\alpha')(v-\\beta'), & (w-\\alpha')(w-\\beta') \\\\\n(u-\\alpha'')(u-\\beta''), & (v-\\alpha'')(v-\\beta''), & (w-\\alpha'')(w-\\beta'')\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n\\]\nIf, for example, \\( u = \\alpha, v = \\beta \\), then we have\n\n\\[\n\\Upsilon(\\alpha - \\beta) = -(\\alpha - \\alpha')(\\beta - \\beta')(\\alpha'' - \\beta'') + (\\beta - \\alpha')(\\beta - \\beta')(\\alpha - \\alpha'') - (\\alpha - \\beta')(\\alpha' - \\beta')(\\alpha'' - \\beta').\n\\]\n\nAnd again, if \\( u = \\alpha, v = \\alpha', w = \\alpha'' \\), then we have\n\n\\[\n\\Upsilon = -(\\alpha - \\beta'')(\\alpha' - \\beta)(\\alpha'' - \\beta') + (\\alpha - \\beta')(\\alpha' - \\beta'')(\\alpha'' - \\beta).\n\\]\n\nOr putting \\( \\Upsilon = 0 \\), the first equation gives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\alpha - \\alpha')(\\beta - \\alpha'')}{(\\alpha - \\alpha'')(\\beta - \\alpha')} = \\frac{(\\alpha - \\beta')(\\beta - \\beta')}{(\\alpha - \\beta')(\\beta - \\beta')};\n\\]\n\nand the second equation gives\n\n\\[\n(\\alpha - \\beta')(\\alpha' - \\beta)(\\alpha'' - \\beta') = (\\alpha - \\beta')(\\alpha' - \\beta'')(\\alpha'' - \\beta),\n\\]\n\nwhich are both of them well-known forms.\n\n114. A corresponding transformation applies to the equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1, & \\alpha, & \\alpha', & \\alpha\\alpha' \\\\\n1, & \\beta, & \\beta', & \\beta\\beta' \\\\\n1, & \\gamma, & \\gamma', & \\gamma\\gamma' \\\\\n1, & \\delta, & \\delta', & \\delta\\delta'\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich expresses the homography of two pairs. In fact, calling the determinant \\( \\Psi \\) and representing by \\( V \\) the similar determinant\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nss', & -s', & -s, & 1 \\\\\ntt', & -t', & -t, & 1 \\\\\nuu', & -u', & -u, & 1 \\\\\nvv', & -v', & -v, & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwhich, equated to zero, would express the homography of the sets \\((s, t, u, v)\\) and \\((s', t', u', v')\\), we have\n\n\\[\nV\\Psi = \\begin{vmatrix}\n(s - \\alpha)(s' - \\alpha'), & (s - \\beta)(s' - \\beta'), & (s - \\gamma)(s' - \\gamma'), & (s - \\delta)(s' - \\delta') \\\\\n(t - \\alpha)(t' - \\alpha'), & (t - \\beta)(t' - \\beta'), & (t - \\gamma)(t' - \\gamma'), & (t - \\delta)(t' - \\delta') \\\\\n(u - \\alpha)(u' - \\alpha'), & (u - \\beta)(u' - \\beta'), & (u - \\gamma)(u' - \\gamma'), & (u - \\delta)(u' - \\delta') \\\\\n(v - \\alpha)(v' - \\alpha'), & (v - \\beta)(v' - \\beta'), & (v - \\gamma)(v' - \\gamma'), & (v - \\delta)(v' - \\delta')\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwhich gives various forms of the equation of homography. In particular, if \\( s = \\alpha, s' = \\beta', t = \\beta, t' = \\alpha', u = \\gamma, u' = \\delta, v = \\delta, v' = \\gamma \\), then\n\n\\[\nV\\Psi = \\begin{vmatrix}\n(\\alpha - \\gamma)(\\beta' - \\gamma'), & (\\alpha - \\delta)(\\beta' - \\delta') \\\\\n(\\beta - \\gamma)(\\alpha' - \\gamma'), & (\\beta - \\delta)(\\alpha' - \\delta') \\\\\n(\\gamma - \\alpha)(\\delta' - \\alpha'), & (\\gamma - \\beta)(\\delta' - \\beta') \\\\\n(\\delta - \\alpha)(\\gamma' - \\alpha'), & (\\delta - \\beta)(\\gamma' - \\beta')\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nand the right-hand side breaks up into factors, which are equal to each other (whence also \\( V = \\Psi \\)), and the equation \\( \\Psi = 0 \\) takes the form\n\n\\[\n(\\alpha - \\gamma)(\\beta - \\delta)(\\alpha' - \\delta')(\\beta' - \\gamma') - (\\alpha - \\delta)(\\beta - \\gamma)(\\alpha' - \\gamma')(\\beta' - \\delta') = 0,\n\\]\nwhich is, in fact, one of the equations which express the equality of the anharmonic ratios of \\((\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)\\) and \\((\\alpha', \\beta', \\gamma', \\delta')\\).\n\n115. In the case of a cubic, the expressions considered are—\n\n\\[\n(a, b, c, d)(x, y)^3,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(ac - b^2, ad - bc, bd - c^2)(x, y)^2,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n-a^2d + 3abc - 2b^3, \\\\\n-abd + 2ac^2 - b^2c, \\\\\n+acd - 2b^2d + bc^2, \\\\\n+ad^2 - 3bcd + 2c^3\n\\end{align*}\n(x, y)^3,\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^3d^3 - 6abcd + 4ac^3 + 4b^3d - 3b^2c^3,\n\\]\n\nwhere (1) is the cubic, (2) is the quadricovariant or Hessian, (3) is the cubicovariant, and (4) is the quartinvariant or discriminant.\n\nAnd where it is convenient to do so, I write\n\n\\[\n(1) = U,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(2) = H,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(3) = \\Phi,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(4) = \\Box,\n\\]\n\nso that we have\n\n\\[\n\\Phi^2 - \\Box U^2 + 4H^3 = 0.\n\\]\n\n116.

Canonical form of the cubic.\n\nThe expressions \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\Phi + U\\sqrt{\\Box}), \\frac{1}{2}(\\Phi - U\\sqrt{\\Box})\\) are perfect cubes; and if we write\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\Phi + U\\sqrt{\\Box}) = \\sqrt{\\Box} x^3, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\Phi - U\\sqrt{\\Box}) = -\\sqrt{\\Box} y^3, \\]\n\nthen we have\n\n\\[ U = x^3 + y^3, \\]\n\\[ \\Phi = \\sqrt{\\Box}(x^3 - y^3), \\]\n\nand thence also\n\n\\[ H = -\\sqrt[3]{\\Box} xy. \\]\n\n121.

It may be observed that we have \\( \\alpha^{-6} \\Box U^2 = -\\frac{1}{27} A^2 B^2 C^2 \\), which, with the above values of \\( H, \\Phi \\) in terms of \\( A, B, C \\) and the equation \\( A + B + C = 0 \\), verifies the equation \\( \\Phi^2 - \\Box U^2 + 4H^2 = 0 \\), which connects the covariants.

The preceding formulae show without difficulty, that each factor of the cubic covariant is the harmonic of a factor of the cubic with respect to the other two factors of the cubic; and moreover, that the factors of the cubic and the cubic covariant form together an involution having for sibiconjugates the factors of the Hessian. In fact, the harmonic of \\( x - \\alpha y \\) with respect to \\( (x - \\beta y)(x - \\gamma y) \\) is \\( (2\\alpha - \\beta - \\gamma)x + (2\\beta \\gamma - \\gamma \\alpha - \\alpha \\beta)y \\), which is a factor of the cubic covariant; the product of the pair of harmonic factors is\n\n\\[ (2\\alpha - \\beta - \\gamma)x^3 + 2(\\beta \\gamma - \\alpha^2)xy + (-2\\alpha \\beta \\gamma + \\alpha^2 \\beta + \\alpha^2 \\gamma)y^3; \\]\nand multiplying this by $\\beta - \\gamma$, and taking the sum of the analogous expressions, this sum vanishes, or the three pairs form an involution. That the Hessian gives the sibi-conjugates of the involution is most readily shown as follows:—the last-mentioned quadric may be written\n\n$$-(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma) + 3\\alpha)x^2 + 2(\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\gamma - \\alpha(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma))xy + (-3\\alpha\\beta\\gamma + \\alpha(\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\gamma))y^2,$$\n\nwhich is equal to\n\n$$\\left(3\\frac{b}{a} + 3\\alpha\\right)x^2 + 2\\left(3\\frac{c}{a} - 3\\frac{b}{a}\\alpha\\right)xy + \\left(3\\frac{d}{a} + 3\\frac{c}{a}\\alpha\\right)y^2,$$\n\nor, throwing out the factor $3a^{-1}$, to\n\n$$(b + \\alpha a, 2c - 2ba, d + ca)(x, y)^2,$$\n\nwhich is harmonically related to the Hessian\n\n$$(ac - b^2, ad - bc, bd - c^2)(x, y)^2;$$\n\nand in like manner the other two pairs of factors will be also harmonically related to the Hessian.\n\n126.

dodecadic*, the coefficients are altogether erroneous. There was, in fact, a fundamental error in the original calculation; instead of repeating it, I have, with a view to the deduction therefrom of the cubinvariant (see Fourth Memoir, No. 78), first calculated the dodecadic quadricovariant, the value of which is given in the following Table:\n\nNo. 49 A.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccccc}\n+1 & ag & +6 & ah & +15 & ai & +20 & aj & +15 & ak & +6 & al & +1 & am \\\\\n-6 & bf & -30 & bg & -54 & bh & -30 & bi & +30 & bj & +54 & bk & +30 & bl \\\\\n+15 & ce & +54 & cf & +24 & cg & -150 & ch & -270 & ci & -150 & cj & +24 & ck \\\\\n-10 & d^2 & -30 & de & +150 & df & +430 & dg & +270 & dh & -270 & di & -430 & dj \\\\\n+34620 & b^5c^3d^3e^3f^3 & +5125 & b^5c^3d^3e^3 & +1080 & fi & +495 & gi & -270 & hi & -135 & i^2 & -720 & gh & -540 & h^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n* Third Memoir, Philosophical Transactions, t. cxlvii.
