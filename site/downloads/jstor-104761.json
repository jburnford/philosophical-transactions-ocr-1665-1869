On Thursday the 23d Instant, the Air 1750. mild and calm, no Wind stirring, the Sun shining bright, at about 45 Minutes past 6 o’Clock in the Morning, a Shock of an Earthquake was sensibly felt here, and hereabout, attended with a loud Noise, and Crack (as some call it): This was perceived both Southward, and Northwardly, for some Seconds.

He felt himself in a very shaking way: The Table at which he sat shivered, and the Windows of the Room jarred: But he did not think of an Earthquake, till the People of the House came into the Room, and told him what had happened.
