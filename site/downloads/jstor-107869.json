S.\n\nRead February 22, 1827.\n\nIn my Paper on the parallax of the fixed stars, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826, by inadvertence the letter \\( l \\) was written for \\( \\lambda \\), in the formula for computing the most advantageous times of year for observations on the parallax of a double star. The mistake was detected, and rectified in an erratum annexed to the 4th Part of the Transactions for that year, but not till the table computed by the erroneous formula was printed off, and too late to cancel the sheet. The errors produced fall wholly on the 5th column of the table in pages 277, 278, of the volume for that year, headed, \"Times of the year most proper for observation;\" which column I have therefore had recomputed, and which is here subjoined. I am happy to be able to add, that except in a few instances, the differences are not so considerable as to render useless any observations which may have been made on the plan proposed, as in the great majority of instances the correct dates do not differ by more than a week from the erroneous ones; and about the times proper for observation, a week or a fortnight one way or the other is of no essential moment.\n| General Number in Messrs.
