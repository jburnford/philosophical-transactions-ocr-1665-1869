By Jeremiah Dixon.\n\nA Journal of my Observations at Hammerfost.\n\n1769.\n\nMay 7\n\nAt half past 10 A.M. anchored in Hammerfost-Bay, near the town of Hammerfost, on Hammerfost-Island.\n\nIn the afternoon went on shore, to find a proper place to observe in; but found none.\n\nMay 8\n\nWent on shore again, to find a place; and, after much search and travel, fixed upon one: but, though the best this or the adjacent islands could afford, is very difficult of access.\n\nMay 9\n\nLanded the house and observatory.\n\nMay 10\n\nDigging holes for fixing the clock-post, and stand for the transit-instrument. Note, the ground so much frozen and rocky, could not finish them this day.\nThe carpenters, this day, put up the house, separate from the observatory; as there was not room left by the carpenter at Greenwich for fixing the transit-instrument.\n\nFinished the digging, and fixed up the post for the clock; also put up that part of the observatory which moves round. Note, the post for the clock was 3 feet deep in the ground.\n\nCarried the instruments on shore: the carpenters working at the observatory.\n\nFixed up the clock, and set it a-going. Note, The upper part of the bob of the pendulum was set to scratch, marked thus \\( \\omega \\) and the index to N° 14. It vibrated on each side of the perpendicular \\( 1^\\circ 30' \\).\n\nPut up the quadrant. It was placed upon the stand provided for it. The stand stood on a large cask filled with water, very firmly fixed in the ground; and the box in the bottom of the stand filled with stones. Cloudy weather.\n\nPlaced one thermometer without doors, and the other within the observatory; also placed the barometer in a proper place.\n\nCloudy till 5 May 20, in the evening; when I took the following equal altitudes of the Sun.\n| May 20 | Sun West. | Sun East. | Point on the quadrant. |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|\n|        | L. limb.  | Up. limb. |                       |\n|        | h, \"      | h, \"      |                       |\n| 9 4 42 | 9 11 5    | 21 54 18  | 22 0 44               |\n|        | 16 26     | 59 37     | 6 5                   |\n|        | 21 44     | 22 4 54   | 11 20                 |\n| 9 41 14| 9 47 46   | 21 17 33  | 21 24 6               |\n|        | 46 33     | 53 8      | 22 58                 |\n|        | 52 2      | 58 33     | 28 2c                 |\n| 10 6 1 | 10 12 40+ | 20 52 24  | 20 59 10              |\n|        | 11 28     | 18 9½     | 58 0                  |\n|        | 16 58     | 23 42     | 21 3 27               |\n|        |           |           | 21 10 7               |\n\nThese correspond to the above point 74, taken in the morning.\n\nFrom the points 72 and 74, in the above sets of observations, I find the clock on the 21st, at noon, to be 12' 53''.2 too slow, and loses at the rate of 2'' per day of sidereal time.\n\nMay 22\n\nMarked a meridian. The mark S° is distant about 2½ miles, and that N° about 2 miles. The situation would not allow me to have marks nearer.\n\nPut the clock forward, to be nearer the right ascension of the mid-heaven.\n\nThis afternoon came on a most violent storm of wind, hail, and snow, which continued till Tuesday evening.\n\nCloudy, with snow, &c.\nDitto. Fixed the transit-instrument.\n\nCloudy, snow, &c.\n| Date       | Sun L. limb | Sun Up. limb | Sun East. | Point |\n|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| 3 May 30   | 9 29 28     | 9 35 56½     |           | 65,00 |\n|            | 34 48       | 41 17        |           |       |\n|            | 40 6        | 46 35        |           |       |\n|            | 49 46½      | 9 56 12      |           | 66,40 |\n|            | 55 6        | 10 1 29      |           |       |\n|            | 10 0 21     | 6 49         |           |       |\n|            | 14 4        | 10 20 32     |           | 68,40 |\n|            | 19 22       | 25 53        |           |       |\n|            | 24 43½      | 31 12        |           |       |\n|            | 10 38 31    | 45 3         |           | 70,40 |\n|            | 43 53       | 50 27½       |           |       |\n|            | 49 18½      | 55 52        |           |       |\n|            | 2d wire.    | 3d or middle wire. | 4th wire. |       |\n| 3 May 31   | 16 34 33½   | 35 19        |           |       |\n|            | 37 35+      | 36 4½        |           |       |\n\nZen. dist.

Ditto with micrometer O O 17 I. 20th. 25th.\n\nto the right.—Long eye-piece and narrow little speculum O O 7 to left of O.—I. 20th. 25th.\n\nLong eye-piece and broad little speculum O 18 17 to the right.—These are the means of 8 or 9 trials each.\n\nThe spot near the Sun's center was thus defined.\n\n| 2 June | Sun | West | Sun | East | Point |\n|--------|-----|------|-----|------|-------|\n| L. limb. | Up. limb. | L. limb. | Up. limb. | L. limb. | 70° 40' |\n| 10 55 1 | 11 7 2 | 22 20 26½ | 22 21 37 | 27 3½ |\n| 11 00 26 | 12 28 | 25 50½ | 32 26 |\n| 11 15 50+ | 11 22 31- | 21 53 48½ | 22 0 37 |\n| 21 21 | 28 3 | 59 23 | 6 9½ |\n| 26 55 | 33 41' | 22 4 56½ | 11 39 |\n\nComputing from this point, the Sun passed the north point of the meridian at 10h 44' 3\" 4,2 per clock.\n| Sun | West | Sun | East | Point |\n|-----|------|-----|------|-------|\n| L. limb. | Up. limb. | L. limb. | Up. limb. | |\n| 11 37 3½ | 43 56½ | 21 32 1 | 21 39 3+ | 74°00 |\n| 42 45 | 49 42 | 37 49 | 44 45 | |\n| 48 26 | 55 29 | 43 33 | 50 25 | |\n\nAt midnight.\n\n| 2d wire. | 3d wire. | 4th wire. |\n|----------|----------|-----------|\n| 16 41 28 | 43 13½ | 43 59½ |\n| 45 30½ | |\n\nSun’s east or first limb passed the transit at midnight.\n\nDitto west limb.\n\nZen. dist. of the Sun’s upper limb 86° 32′ 57″.

Now by putting up another mark at the same distance as the first, so as to correspond to the second wire, and measuring the distance between this and the first mark, I find it to be 36 feet. This increased in the ratio of the zen. dist. $86^\\circ\\ 48'$ to rad. gives $36,057$ feet for the space corresponding to $45'\\frac{1}{2}$, the time of the Sun's passage from the second to the third or middle wire.\n\nThe reason of this increase is, that all the wires in a transit instrument, except the middle one, describe lesser circles, parallel to the middle one, which describes an azimuth.—Having got what space corresponds to $45'\\frac{1}{2}$, we have, by proportion, $14,76$ feet for the space, answering to $18''$,63, which the mark must be moved westward to be in the true meridian.\n\n**THE TRANSIT OF VENUS.**\n\n| Time p. clock | Saw the planet Venus upon the Sun about half immersed. |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1769 June 3   | Not totally immersed.                                   |\n|               | The planet seemed to be completely upon the Sun, but no thread of light: this was an instantaneous view, and through a thin cloud. |\n|               | The air all this time very hazy.                       |\n|               | Saw Venus upon the Sun's limb, the 2d internal contact being past.
