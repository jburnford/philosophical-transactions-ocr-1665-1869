IX. Observations of the Transit of Mercury, May 4, 1786, at Dresden. By M. Köhler, Inspector of the Mathematical Repository of the Elector of Saxony; communicated by the Count de Brühl, F. R. S.

Read December 21, 1786.

Apparent time.

9 21' 54" beginning of the planet's egress, doubtful.
9 25' 23" complete egress, or last contact, very certain.

The telescope with which Mr. Köhler observed, was a 9-feet refractor of Dollond's, magnifying 104 times.

He has made a comparison of his observation with that of Alexander Aubert, Esq. from which he has inferred the longitude of Dresden in the following manner.

| Exterior contact observed by Mr. Aubert at | Mean time. |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Equation                                  | + 3 28,3   |
| Difference of parallax                    | + 0 13,4   |

| Apparent time at Loam-pit Hill            | 8 30 46,7  |
| Loam-pit Hill west of Greenwich           | + 0 5,4    |
| Apparent time at Greenwich                | 8 30 52,1  |
| Apparent time at Dresden                  | 9 25 23,0  |

Longitude of Dresden east of Greenwich 54 30,9
