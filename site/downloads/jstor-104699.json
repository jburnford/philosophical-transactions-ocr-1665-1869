  "text": "meters, have thought the 11th of June 1748 was hotter: But I imagine the Reason to be, that the Heat this Year came on gradually from Day to Day; whereas in the Year 1748 it was much more sudden; the Thermometer then rising 22 Degrees more in one Day than the preceding; which, consequently, would make the Difference between one Day and another appear the more extraordinary. But, by my Observations on the 11th of June 1748, Hauksbee's Thermometer stood at $14\\frac{1}{2}$; full 6 Degrees cooler than on the 11th of this present July.
