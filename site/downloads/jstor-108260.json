The lightning had a very purplish appearance. The storm continued for the space of twelve to fourteen minutes, after which it became perfectly calm. At 7 A.M. the barometer was much depressed, having fallen nearly an inch from the previous afternoon. It stood thus on the 2nd, at 3 P.M., F. 30.109; C. 30.100; and on the 3rd, at 7 A.M., F. 29.324; C. 29.318; and it continued falling until the following day, when at 3 P.M. it began to rise.—J. D.
