Mr. Henderson on the difference of meridians, &c.

The above rectification of the observations made to ascertain the difference of longitude between Paris and Greenwich, not only adds greatly to the merit of the distinguished observers employed in the work, but trebles the value of their results by narrowing the extreme range of the experiments from $0^\circ.65$ to $0^\circ.21$.
