Then the Index will shew the Degree of Expansion of the second Metal, as it did of the first; and, by this Means, the Degrees of Expansion of different Metals by the same Degree of Heat, may be exactly estimated.\n\nII. A further Account of the Bones of Animals being made Red by Aliment only. By John Belchier, F. R. S.\n\nIn the former Account, which I gave concerning the Red Bones of the Hogs, (see No. 442. p. 286.) I mention'd, That the Colour was occasion'd by Bran, (being mix'd with their common Food) after it had been made Use of to clean printed Callicoes; the Colours of which were made, some from Preparations of Iron, which were the Blacks and Purples; others from Preparations of Alum, and Sacc. Saturni, which produces the Red Colours; and that Madder Root was made Use of to fix these Colours on the Cloth.—To which of these Preparations the Colour was owing, I could not determine. Some were of Opinion, that it was entirely occasion'd by the Preparations of Iron; others, that it was the whole blended together.: And, in or-\nder to clear up this Point, I determin'd to make some Experiments. The first I made was upon a Cock, by mixing some of the Madder Root with Fig Dust, on which they feed.—The Cock dying within sixteen Days after his first feeding on the Madder, I dissected him, and examin'd the Bones, not in the least Expectation of finding them ting'd in so small a Time; but, to my great Surprize, found them universally of a Red Colour: So that, from this Experiment, it appears, that the Madder alone causes this Alteration: But why the Bones only are affected, I shall consider of in the Course of more Experiments.\n\nIII.
