On a General Method in Dynamics; by which the Study of the Motions of all free Systems of attracting or repelling Points is reduced to the Search and Differentiation of one central Relation, or characteristic Function. By William Rowan Hamilton, Member of several scientific Societies in the British Dominions, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Andrews' Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland. Communicated by Captain Beaufort, R.N. F.R.S.\n\nReceived April 1,—Read April 10, 1834.\n\nIntroductory Remarks.\n\nThe theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance, that it has engaged the attention of all the most eminent mathematicians, since the invention of dynamics as a mathematical science by Galileo, and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by Newton. Among the successors of those illustrious men, Lagrange has perhaps done more than any other analyst, to give extent and harmony to such deductive researches, by showing that the most varied consequences respecting the motions of systems of bodies may be derived from one radical formula; the beauty of the method so suiting the dignity of the results, as to make of his great work a kind of scientific poem. But the science of force, or of power acting by law in space and time, has undergone already another revolution, and has become already more dynamic, by having almost dismissed the conceptions of solidity and cohesion, and those other material ties, or geometrically imaginable conditions, which Lagrange so happily reasoned on, and by tending more and more to resolve all connexions and actions of bodies into attractions and repulsions of points: and while the science is advancing thus in one direction by the improvement of physical views, it may advance in another direction also by the invention of mathematical methods. And the method proposed in the present essay, for the deductive study of the motions of attracting or repelling systems, will perhaps be received with indulgence, as an attempt to assist in carrying forward so high an inquiry.\n\nIn the methods commonly employed, the determination of the motion of a free point in space, under the influence of accelerating forces, depends on the integration of three equations in ordinary differentials of the second order; and the determination of the motions of a system of free points, attracting or repelling one another, depends on the integration of a system of such equations, in number threefold the\nnumber of the attracting or repelling points, unless we previously diminish by unity this latter number, by considering only relative motions. Thus, in the solar system, when we consider only the mutual attractions of the sun and of the ten known planets, the determination of the motions of the latter about the former is reduced, by the usual methods, to the integration of a system of thirty ordinary differential equations of the second order, between the coordinates and the time; or, by a transformation of Lagrange, to the integration of a system of sixty ordinary differential equations of the first order, between the time and the elliptic elements: by which integrations, the thirty varying coordinates, or the sixty varying elements, are to be found as functions of the time. In the method of the present essay, this problem is reduced to the search and differentiation of a single function, which satisfies two partial differential equations of the first order and of the second degree: and every other dynamical problem, respecting the motions of any system, however numerous, of attracting or repelling points, (even if we suppose those points restricted by any conditions of connexion consistent with the law of living force,) is reduced, in like manner, to the study of one central function, of which the form marks out and characterizes the properties of the moving system, and is to be determined by a pair of partial differential equations of the first order, combined with some simple considerations. The difficulty is therefore at least transferred from the integration of many equations of one class to the integration of two of another: and even if it should be thought that no practical facility is gained, yet an intellectual pleasure may result from the reduction of the most complex and, probably, of all researches respecting the forces and motions of body, to the study of one characteristic function*, the unfolding of one central relation.\n\nThe present essay does not pretend to treat fully of this extensive subject,—a task which may require the labours of many years and many minds; but only to suggest the thought and propose the path to others. Although, therefore, the method may be used in the most varied dynamical researches, it is at present only applied to the orbits and perturbations of a system with any laws of attraction or repulsion, and with one predominant mass or centre of predominant energy; and only so far, even in this one research, as appears sufficient to make the principle itself understood. It may be mentioned here, that this dynamical principle is only another form of that idea which has already been applied to optics in the Theory of systems of rays, and that an intention of applying it to the motions of systems of bodies was announced†\n\n* Lagrange and, after him, Laplace and others, have employed a single function to express the different forces of a system, and so to form in an elegant manner the differential equations of its motion. By this conception, great simplicity has been given to the statement of the problem of dynamics; but the solution of that problem, or the expression of the motions themselves, and of their integrals, depends on a very different and hitherto unimagined function, as it is the purpose of this essay to show.\n\n† Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xv. page 80. A notice of this dynamical principle was also lately given in an article \"On a general Method of expressing the Paths of Light and of the Planets,\" published in the Dublin University Review for October 1833.\nat the publication of that theory. And besides the idea itself, the manner of calculation also, which has been thus exemplified in the sciences of optics and dynamics, seems not confined to those two sciences, but capable of other applications; and the peculiar combination which it involves, of the principles of variations with those of partial differentials, for the determination and use of an important class of integrals, may constitute, when it shall be matured by the future labours of mathematicians, a separate branch of analysis.\n\nWilliam R. Hamilton.\n\nObservatory, Dublin,\nMarch 1834.\n\nIntegration of the Equations of Motion of a System, characteristic Function of such Motion, and Law of varying Action.\n\n1. The known differential equations of motion of a system of free points, repelling or attracting one another according to any functions of their distances, and not disturbed by any foreign force, may be comprised in the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\Sigma . m (x'' \\delta x + y'' \\delta y + z'' \\delta z) = \\delta U. \\]  \n\nIn this formula the sign of summation \\( \\Sigma \\) extends to all the points of the system; \\( m \\) is, for any one such point, the constant called its mass; \\( x'', y'', z'' \\), are its component accelerations, or the second differential coefficients of its rectangular coordinates \\( x, y, z \\), taken with respect to the time; \\( \\delta x, \\delta y, \\delta z \\), are any arbitrary infinitesimal displacements which the point can be imagined to receive in the same three rectangular directions; and \\( \\delta U \\) is the infinitesimal variation corresponding, of a function \\( U \\) of the masses and mutual distances of the several points of the system, of which the form depends on the laws of their mutual actions, by the equation\n\n\\[ U = \\Sigma . m m_i f(r), \\]\n\n\\( r \\) being the distance between any two points \\( m, m_p \\), and the function \\( f(r) \\) being such that its derivative or differential coefficient \\( f'(r) \\) expresses the law of their repulsion, being negative in the case of attraction. The function which has been here called \\( U \\), may be named the force-function of a system: it is of great utility in theoretical mechanics, into which it was introduced by Lagrange, and it furnishes the following elegant forms for the differential equations of motion, included in the formula (1.):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nm_1 x''_1 &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta x_1}; & m_2 x''_2 &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta x_2}; & \\ldots & m_n x''_n &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta x_n}; \\\\\nm_1 y''_1 &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta y_1}; & m_2 y''_2 &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta y_2}; & \\ldots & m_n y''_n &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta y_n}; \\\\\nm_1 z''_1 &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta z_1}; & m_2 z''_2 &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta z_2}; & \\ldots & m_n z''_n &= \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta z_n};\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthe second members of these equations being the partial differential coefficients of\nthe first order of the function $U$. But notwithstanding the elegance and simplicity of this known manner of stating the principal problem of dynamics, the difficulty of solving that problem, or even of expressing its solution, has hitherto appeared insuperable; so that only seven intermediate integrals, or integrals of the first order, with as many arbitrary constants, have hitherto been found for these general equations of motion of a system of $n$ points, instead of $3 n$ intermediate and $3 n$ final integrals, involving ultimately $6 n$ constants; nor has any integral been found which does not need to be integrated again. No general solution has been obtained assigning (as a complete solution ought to do) $3 n$ relations between the $n$ masses $m_1$, $m_2$, $\\ldots m_n$, the $3 n$ varying coordinates $x_1, y_1, z_1, \\ldots x_n, y_n, z_n$, the varying time $t$, and the $6 n$ initial data of the problem, namely, the initial coordinates $a_1, b_1, c_1, \\ldots a_n, b_n, c_n$, and their initial rates of increase, $d'_1, b'_1, c'_1, \\ldots d'_n, b'_n, c'_n$; the quantities called here initial being those which correspond to the arbitrary origin of time. It is, however, possible (as we shall see) to express these long-sought relations by the partial differential coefficients of a new central or radical function, to the search and employment of which the difficulty of mathematical dynamics becomes henceforth reduced.\n\n2. If we put for abridgement\n\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum m(x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2),$$\n\nso that $2 T$ denotes, as in the Mécanique Analytique, the whole living force of the system; $(x', y', z')$, being here, according to the analogy of our foregoing notation, the rectangular components of velocity of the point $m$, or the first differential coefficients of its coordinates taken with respect to the time;) an easy and well known combination of the differential equations of motion, obtained by changing in the formula (1.) the variations to the differentials of the coordinates, may be expressed in the following manner,\n\n$$dT = dU,$$\n\nand gives, by integration, the celebrated law of living force, under the form\n\n$$T = U + H.$$  \n\nIn this expression, which is one of the seven known integrals already mentioned, the quantity $H$ is independent of the time, and does not alter in the passage of the points of the system from one set of positions to another. We have, for example, an initial equation of the same form, corresponding to the origin of time, which may be written thus,\n\n$$T_0 = U_0 + H.$$  \n\nThe quantity $H$ may, however, receive any arbitrary increment whatever, when we pass in thought from a system moving in one way, to the same system moving in another, with the same dynamical relations between the accelerations and positions of its points, but with different initial data; but the increment of $H$, thus obtained,\nis evidently connected with the analogous increments of the functions $T$ and $U$, by the relation\n\n$$\\Delta T = \\Delta U + \\Delta H,$$\n\nwhich, for the case of infinitesimal variations, may conveniently be written thus,\n\n$$\\delta T = \\delta U + \\delta H;$$\n\nand this last relation, when multiplied by $dt$, and integrated, conducts to an important result. For it thus becomes, by (4.) and (1.), \n\n$$\\int \\Sigma m (dx' \\delta x' + dy' \\delta y' + dz' \\delta z') = \\int \\Sigma m (dx' \\delta x + dy' \\delta y + dz' \\delta z) + \\int \\delta H \\cdot dt,$$\n\nthat is, by the principles of the calculus of variations,\n\n$$\\delta V = \\Sigma m (x' \\delta x + y' \\delta y + z' \\delta z) - \\Sigma m (a' \\delta a + b' \\delta b + c' \\delta c) + t \\delta H,$$\n\nif we denote by $V$ the integral\n\n$$V = \\int \\Sigma m (x' dx + y' dy + z' dz) = \\int_0^t 2T dt,$$\n\nnamely, the accumulated living force, called often the action of the system, from its initial to its final position.\n\nIf, then, we consider (as it is easy to see that we may) the action $V$ as a function of the initial and final coordinates, and of the quantity $H$, we shall have, by (A.), the following groups of equations; first, the group,\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_1} = m_1 x'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_2} = m_2 x'_2; \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_n} = m_n x'_n;$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_1} = m_1 y'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_2} = m_2 y'_2; \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_n} = m_n y'_n;$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_1} = m_1 z'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_2} = m_2 z'_2; \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_n} = m_n z'_n;$$\n\nSecondly, the group,\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_1} = -m_1 a'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_2} = -m_2 a'_2; \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_n} = -m_n a'_n;$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_1} = -m_1 b'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_2} = -m_2 b'_2; \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_n} = -m_n b'_n;$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_1} = -m_1 c'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_2} = -m_2 c'_2; \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_n} = -m_n c'_n;$$\n\nand finally, the equation,\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta H} = t;$$\n\nSo that if this function $V$ were known, it would only remain to eliminate $H$ between the $3n + 1$ equations (C.) and (E.), in order to obtain all the $3n$ intermediate integrals, or between (D.) and (E.) to obtain all the $3n$ final integrals of the differential equations of motion; that is, ultimately, to obtain the $3n$ sought relations between\nthe $3n$ varying coordinates and the time, involving also the masses and the $6n$ initial data above mentioned; the discovery of which relations would be (as we have said) the general solution of the general problem of dynamics. We have, therefore, at least reduced that general problem to the search and differentiation of a single function $V$, which we shall call on this account the characteristic function of motion of a system; and the equation (A.), expressing the fundamental law of its variation, we shall call the equation of the characteristic function, or the law of varying action.\n\n3. To show more clearly that the action or accumulated living force of a system, or in other words, the integral of the product of the living force by the element of the time, may be regarded as a function of the $6n + 1$ quantities already mentioned, namely, of the initial and final coordinates, and of the quantity $H$, we may observe, that whatever depends on the manner and time of motion of the system may be considered as such a function; because the initial form of the law of living force, when combined with the $3n$ known or unknown relations between the time, the initial data, and the varying coordinates, will always furnish $3n + 1$ relations, known or unknown, to connect the time and the initial components of velocities with the initial and final coordinates, and with $H$. Yet from not having formed the conception of the action as a function of this kind, the consequences that have been here deduced from the formula (A.) for the variation of that definite integral, appear to have escaped the notice of Lagrange, and of the other illustrious analysts who have written on theoretical mechanics; although they were in possession of a formula for the variation of this integral not greatly differing from ours. For although Lagrange and others, in treating of the motion of a system, have shown that the variation of this definite integral vanishes when the extreme coordinates and the constant $H$ are given, they appear to have deduced from this result only the well known law of least action; namely, that if the points or bodies of a system be imagined to move from a given set of initial to a given set of final positions, not as they do nor even as they could move consistently with the general dynamical laws or differential equations of motion, but so as not to violate any supposed geometrical connexions, nor that one dynamical relation between velocities and configurations which constitutes the law of living force; and if, besides, this geometrically imaginable, but dynamically impossible motion, be made to differ infinitely little from the actual manner of motion of the system, between the given extreme positions; then the varied value of the definite integral called action, or the accumulated living force of the system in the motion thus imagined, will differ infinitely less from the actual value of that integral. But when this well known law of least, or as it might be better called, of stationary action, is applied to the determination of the actual motion of a system, it serves only to form, by the rules of the calculus of variations, the differential equations of motion of the second order, which can always be otherwise found. It seems, therefore, to be with reason that Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson have spoken lightly of the utility of this principle in the present state of dynamics. A different estimate, perhaps, will be formed of that\nother principle which has been introduced in the present paper, under the name of the law of varying action, in which we pass from an actual motion to another motion dynamically possible, by varying the extreme positions of the system, and (in general) the quantity $H$, and which serves to express, by means of a single function, not the mere differential equations of motion, but their intermediate and their final integrals.\n\nVerifications of the foregoing Integrals.\n\n4. A verification, which ought not to be neglected, and at the same time an illustration of this new principle, may be obtained by deducing the known differential equations of motion from our system of intermediate integrals, and by showing the consistence of these again with our final integral system. As preliminary to such verification, it is useful to observe that the final equation (6.) of living force, when combined with the system (C.), takes this new form,\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\sum \\frac{1}{m} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z} \\right)^2 \\right] = U + H; \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (F.)$$\n\nand that the initial equation (7.) of living force becomes by (D.)\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\sum \\frac{1}{m} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial a} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial b} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial c} \\right)^2 \\right] = U_0 + H. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (G.)$$\n\nThese two partial differential equations, initial and final, of the first order and the second degree, must both be identically satisfied by the characteristic function $V$: they furnish (as we shall find) the principal means of discovering the form of that function, and are of essential importance in its theory. If the form of this function were known, we might eliminate $3n - 1$ of the $3n$ initial coordinates between the $3n$ equations (C.); and although we cannot yet perform the actual process of this elimination, we are entitled to assert that it would remove along with the others the remaining initial coordinate, and would conduct to the equation (6.) of final living force, which might then be transformed into the equation (F.). In like manner we may conclude that all the $3n$ final coordinates could be eliminated together from the $3n$ equations (D.), and that the result would be the initial equation (7.) of living force, or the transformed equation (G.). We may therefore consider the law of living force, which assisted us in discovering the properties of our characteristic function $V$, as included reciprocally in those properties, and as resulting by elimination, in every particular case, from the systems (C.) and (D.); and in treating of either of these systems, or in conducting any other dynamical investigation by the method of this characteristic function, we are at liberty to employ the partial differential equations (F.) and (G.), which that function must necessarily satisfy.\n\nIt will now be easy to deduce, as we proposed, the known equations of motion (3.) of the second order, by differentiation and elimination of constants, from our interme-\nmediate integral system (C.), (E.), or even from a part of that system, namely, from the group (C.), when combined with the equation (F.). For we thus obtain\n\n\\[ m_1 \\frac{d^2 V}{dt^2} = x'_1 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1^2} + x'_2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} + \\cdots + x'_n \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_n} + y'_1 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial y_1} + y'_2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial y_2} + \\cdots + y'_n \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial y_n} + z'_1 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial z_1} + z'_2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial z_2} + \\cdots + z'_n \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial z_n} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_1} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1^2} + \\frac{1}{m_2} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_2^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_n} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_n^2} + \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y_1} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial y_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y_2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_2 \\partial y_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y_n} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_n \\partial y_n} + \\frac{1}{m_1} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z_1} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_1 \\partial z_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z_2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_2 \\partial z_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z_n} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_n \\partial z_n} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z} \\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (U + H); \\quad \\ldots \\quad (11.) \\]\n\nthat is, we obtain\n\n\\[ m_1 \\frac{d^2 U}{dt^2} = \\cdots \\cdots \\cdots \\cdots \\quad (12.) \\]\n\nAnd in like manner we might deduce, by differentiation, from the integrals (C.) and from (F.) all the other known differential equations of motion, of the second order, contained in the set marked (3.); or, more concisely, we may deduce at once the formula (1.), which contains all those known equations, by observing that the intermediate integrals (C.), when combined with the relation (F.), give\n\n\\[ \\Sigma \\cdot m(x'\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} + y'\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} + z'\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z}) = \\Sigma \\left( \\frac{d^2 V}{dt^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{d^2 V}{dt^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{d^2 V}{dt^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial z^2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\Sigma \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial z^2} \\right) \\Sigma \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial z^2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\Sigma \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial z^2} \\right) (U + H) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\partial U. \\quad \\ldots \\quad (13.) \\]\n\n5.

In order, therefore, to show that they are satisfied by the group (C.), it is sufficient to prove that the following equations are true,\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta a_i} \\sum \\frac{1}{2m} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right)^2 \\right\\},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta b_i} \\sum \\frac{1}{2m} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right)^2 \\right\\},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta c_i} \\sum \\frac{1}{2m} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right)^2 \\right\\},\n\\]\n\nthe integer \\(i\\) receiving any value from 1 to \\(n\\) inclusive; which may be shown at once, and the required verification thereby be obtained, if we merely take the variation of the relation (F.) with respect to the initial coordinates, as in the former verification.\nwe took its variation with respect to the final coordinates, and so obtained results which agreed with the known equations of motion, and which may be thus collected,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta x_i} \\sum \\frac{1}{2m} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right)^2 \\right\\} = \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta x_i};\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta y_i} \\sum \\frac{1}{2m} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right)^2 \\right\\} = \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta y_i};\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta z_i} \\sum \\frac{1}{2m} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right)^2 \\right\\} = \\frac{\\delta U}{\\delta z_i}.\n\\]\n\nThe same relation (F.), by being varied with respect to the quantity H, conducts to the expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta H} \\sum \\frac{1}{2m} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right)^2 \\right\\} = 1;\n\\]\n\nand this, when developed, agrees with the equation (K.), which is a new verification of the consistence of our foregoing results. Nor would it have been much more difficult, by the help of the foregoing principles, to have integrated directly our integrals of the first order, and so to have deduced in a different way our final integral system.\n\n6. It may be considered as still another verification of our own general integral equations, to show that they include not only the known law of living force, or the integral expressing that law, but also the six other known integrals of the first order, which contain the law of motion of the centre of gravity, and the law of description of areas. For this purpose, it is only necessary to observe that it evidently follows from the conception of our characteristic function V, that this function depends on the initial and final positions of the attracting or repelling points of a system, not as referred to any foreign standard, but only as compared with one another; and therefore that this function will not vary, if without making any real change in either initial or final configuration, or in the relation of these to each other, we alter at once all the initial and all the final positions of the points of the system, by any common motion, whether of translation or of rotation. Now by considering three coordinate translations, we obtain the three following partial differential equations of the first order, which the function V must satisfy,\n\n\\[\n\\sum \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} + \\sum \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a} = 0;\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sum \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} + \\sum \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b} = 0;\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sum \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} + \\sum \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c} = 0;\n\\]\n\nand by considering three coordinate rotations, we obtain these three other relations between the partial differential coefficients of the same order of the same characteristic function,\n\\[\n\\Sigma \\left( x \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} - y \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} \\right) + \\Sigma \\left( a \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b} - b \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a} \\right) = 0; \\\\\n\\Sigma \\left( y \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} - z \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y} \\right) + \\Sigma \\left( b \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c} - c \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b} \\right) = 0; \\\\\n\\Sigma \\left( z \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x} - x \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z} \\right) + \\Sigma \\left( c \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a} - a \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c} \\right) = 0;\n\\]\n\nand if we change the final coefficients of \\( V \\) to the final components of momentum, and the initial coefficients to the initial components taken negatively, according to the dynamical properties of this function expressed by the integrals (C.) and (D.), we shall change these partial differential equations (O.) (P.), to the following,\n\n\\[\n\\Sigma . m x' = \\Sigma . m a'; \\quad \\Sigma . m y' = \\Sigma . m b'; \\quad \\Sigma . m z' = \\Sigma . m c';\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\Sigma . m (xy' - yx') = \\Sigma . m (ab' - ba'); \\\\\n\\Sigma . m (yz' - zy') = \\Sigma . m (bc' - cb'); \\\\\n\\Sigma . m (zx' - xz') = \\Sigma . m (ca' - ac').\n\\]\n\nIn this manner, therefore, we can deduce from the properties of our characteristic function the six other known integrals above mentioned, in addition to that seventh which contains the law of living force, and which assisted in the discovery of our method.\n\n**Introduction of relative or polar Coordinates, or other marks of position of a System.**\n\n7. The property of our characteristic function, by which it depends only on the internal or mutual relations between the positions initial and final of the points of an attracting or repelling system, suggests an advantage in employing internal or relative coordinates; and from the analogy of other applications of algebraical methods to researches of a geometrical kind, it may be expected that polar and other marks of position will also often be found useful. Supposing, therefore, that the \\( 3n \\) final coordinates \\( x_1 y_1 z_1 \\ldots x_n y_n z_n \\) have been expressed as functions of \\( 3n \\) other variables, \\( \\eta_1 \\eta_2 \\ldots \\eta_{3n} \\), and that the \\( 3n \\) initial coordinates have in like manner been expressed as functions of \\( 3n \\) similar quantities, which we shall call \\( e_1 e_2 \\ldots e_{3n} \\), we shall proceed to assign a general method for introducing these new marks of position into the expressions of our fundamental relations.\n\nFor this purpose we have only to transform the law of varying action, or the fundamental formula (A.), by transforming the two sums,\n\n\\[\n\\Sigma . m (x' \\delta x + y' \\delta y + z' \\delta z), \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Sigma . m (a' \\delta a + b' \\delta b + c' \\delta c),\n\\]\n\nwhich it involves, and which are respectively equivalent to the following more developed expressions,\n\\[\n\\Sigma \\cdot m (x' \\delta x + y' \\delta y + z' \\delta z) = m_1 (x'_1 \\delta x_1 + y'_1 \\delta y_1 + z'_1 \\delta z_1) \\\\\n+ m_2 (x'_2 \\delta x_2 + y'_2 \\delta y_2 + z'_2 \\delta z_2) \\\\\n+ \\text{c.} + m_n (x'_n \\delta x_n + y'_n \\delta y_n + z'_n \\delta z_n); \\quad \\ldots \\quad (17.)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Sigma \\cdot m (a' \\delta a + b' \\delta b + c' \\delta c) = m_1 (a'_1 \\delta a_1 + b'_1 \\delta b_1 + c'_1 \\delta c_1) \\\\\n+ m_2 (a'_2 \\delta a_2 + b'_2 \\delta b_2 + c'_2 \\delta c_2) \\\\\n+ \\text{c.} + m_n (a'_n \\delta a_n + b'_n \\delta b_n + c'_n \\delta c_n). \\quad \\ldots \\quad (18.)\n\\]\n\nNow \\(x_i\\) being by supposition a function of the \\(3n\\) new marks of position \\(\\eta_1 \\ldots \\eta_{3n}\\), its variation \\(\\delta x_i\\), and its differential coefficient \\(x'_i\\), may be thus expressed:\n\n\\[\n\\delta x_i = \\frac{\\delta x_i}{\\delta \\eta_1} \\delta \\eta_1 + \\frac{\\delta x_i}{\\delta \\eta_2} \\delta \\eta_2 + \\ldots + \\frac{\\delta x_i}{\\delta \\eta_{3n}} \\delta \\eta_{3n}; \\quad \\ldots \\quad (19.)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx'_i = \\frac{\\delta x_i}{\\delta \\eta_1} \\eta'_1 + \\frac{\\delta x_i}{\\delta \\eta_2} \\eta'_2 + \\ldots + \\frac{\\delta x_i}{\\delta \\eta_{3n}} \\eta'_{3n}; \\quad \\ldots \\quad (20.)\n\\]\n\nand similarly for \\(y_i\\) and \\(z_i\\). If, then, we consider \\(x'_i\\) as a function, by (20.), of \\(\\eta'_1 \\ldots \\eta'_{3n}\\), involving also in general \\(\\eta_1 \\ldots \\eta_{3n}\\), and if we take its partial differential coefficients of the first order with respect to \\(\\eta'_1 \\ldots \\eta'_{3n}\\), we find the relations,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta x'_i}{\\delta \\eta'_1} = \\frac{\\delta x_i}{\\delta \\eta_1};

while the \\( 3n \\) intermediate integrals, or integrals of the first order, which connect the same varying marks of position and their first differential coefficients with the time, the masses, and the initial marks of position, are the result of elimination of the same auxiliary constant \\( H \\) between the equations (R.) and (E.). Our fundamental formula, and intermediate and final integrals, can therefore be very simply expressed with any new sets of coordinates; and the partial differential equations (F.) (G.), which our characteristic function \\( V \\) must satisfy, and which are, as we have said, essential in the theory of that function, can also easily be expressed with any such transformed coordinates, by merely combining the final and initial expressions of the law of living force,\n\n\\[\nT = U + H, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (6.)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nT_0 = U_0 + H, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (7.)\n\\]\n\nwith the new groups (R.) and (S.). For this purpose we must now consider the function \\( U \\), of the masses and mutual distances of the several points of the system, as depending on the new marks of position \\( \\eta_1 \\eta_2 \\ldots \\eta_{3n} \\); and the analogous function \\( U_0 \\), as depending similarly on the initial quantities \\( e_1 e_2 \\ldots e_{3n} \\); we must also suppose\nthat $T$ is expressed (as it may) as a function of its own coefficients $\\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_1}, \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_{3n}}$, which will always be, with respect to these, homogeneous of the second dimension, and may also involve explicitly the quantities $\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\ldots, \\eta_{3n}$; and that $T_0$ is expressed as a similar function of its coefficients $\\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_1}, \\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_{3n}}$; so that\n\n$$T = F \\left( \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_1}, \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta \\eta'_{3n}} \\right),$$\n\n$$T_0 = F \\left( \\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_1}, \\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_{3n}} \\right);$$\n\nand that then these coefficients of $T$ and $T_0$ are changed to their values $(R.)$ and $(S.)$, so as to give, instead of $(F.)$ and $(G.)$, two other transformed equations, namely,\n\n$$F \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta \\eta_1}, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta \\eta_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta \\eta_{3n}} \\right) = U + H,$$\n\nand, on account of the homogeneity and dimension of $T_0$,\n\n$$F \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta e_1}, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta e_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta e_{3n}} \\right) = U_0 + H.$$\n\n8. Nor is there any difficulty in deducing analogous transformations for the known differential equations of motion of the second order, of any system of free points, by taking the variation of the new form $(T.)$ of the law of living force, and by attending to the dynamical meanings of the coefficients of our characteristic function.

And if we were to suppose (as it has often been thought convenient and even necessary to do,) that the \\( n \\) points of a system are not entirely free, nor subject only to their own mutual attractions or repulsions, but connected by any geometrical conditions, and influenced by any foreign agencies, consistent with the law of conservation of living force; so that the number of independent marks of position should be now less numerous, and the force-function \\( U \\) less simple than before; it might still be proved, by a reasoning very similar to the foregoing, that on these suppositions also (which, however, the dynamical spirit is tending more and more to exclude,) the accumulated living force or action \\( V \\) of the system is a characteristic motion-function of the kind already explained; having the same law and formula of variation, which are susceptible of the same transformations; obliged to satisfy in the same way a final and an initial relation between its partial differential coefficients of the first order; conducting, by the variation of one of these two relations, to the same canonical forms assigned by Lagrange for the differential equations of motion; and furnishing, on the same principles as before, their intermediate and their final integrals. To those imaginable cases, indeed, in which the law of living force no longer holds, our method also would not apply; but it appears to be the growing conviction of the persons who have meditated the most profoundly on the mathematical dynamics of the universe, that these are cases suggested by insufficient views of the mutual actions of body.\n\n9. It results from the foregoing remarks, that in order to apply our method of the characteristic function to any problem of dynamics respecting any moving system, the known law of living force is to be combined with our law of varying action; and that the general expression of this latter law is to be obtained in the following manner. We are first to express the quantity \\( T \\), namely, the half of the living force of the system, as a function (which will always be homogeneous of the second dimension,) of the differential coefficients or rates of increase \\( \\eta'_1, \\eta'_2, \\&c. \\), of any rectangular coordinates, or other marks of position of the system: we are next to take the variation of this homogeneous function with respect to those rates of increase, and to change the variations of those rates \\( \\delta \\eta'_1, \\delta \\eta'_2, \\&c. \\), to the variations \\( \\delta \\eta_1, \\delta \\eta_2, \\&c. \\), of the marks of position themselves; and then to subtract the initial from the final value of the result, and to equate the remainder to \\( \\delta V - t \\delta H \\). A slight consideration will show that this general rule or process for obtaining the variation of the characteristic function \\( V \\), is applicable even when the marks of position \\( \\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\&c. \\), are not all independent of each other; which will happen when they have been made, from any motive of convenience, more numerous than the rectangular coordinates of the several points of the system. For if we suppose that the \\( 3n \\) rectangular coordinates \\( x_1 y_1 z_1 \\ldots x_n y_n z_n \\), have been expressed by any transformation as functions of \\( 3n + k \\) other marks of position, \\( \\eta_1 \\eta_2 \\ldots \\eta_{3n+k} \\), which must therefore be connected by \\( k \\) equations of condition,\n\\[ 0 = \\varphi_1(\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\ldots, \\eta_{3n+k}), \\]\n\\[ 0 = \\varphi_2(\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\ldots, \\eta_{3n+k}), \\]\n\\[ \\ldots \\ldots \\]\n\\[ 0 = \\varphi_k(\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\ldots, \\eta_{3n+k}), \\]\n\ngiving \\( k \\) of the new marks of position as

We find, therefore, for the relative motion of a system about its own centre of gravity, equations of the same form as those which we had obtained before for the absolute motion of the same system of points in space. And we see that in investigating such relative motion only, it is useful to confine ourselves to the part $V_\\rho$ of our whole characteristic function, that is, to the relative action of the system, or accumulated living force of the motion about the centre of gravity; and to consider this part as the characteristic function of such relative motion, in a sense analogous to that which has been already explained.\n\nThis relative action, or part $V_\\rho$, may, however, be otherwise expressed, and even in an infinite variety of ways, on account of the six equations of condition which connect the 6 $n$ centrobaric coordinates; and every different preparation of its form will give a different set of values for the six multipliers $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\Lambda_1, \\Lambda_2, \\Lambda_3$. For example, we might eliminate, by a previous preparation, the six centrobaric coordinates of the point $m_n$ from the expression of $V_\\rho$, so as to make this expression involve only the centrobaric coordinates of the other $n - 1$ points of the system, and then we should have\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V_\\rho}{\\delta x_{in}} = 0, \\frac{\\delta V_\\rho}{\\delta y_{in}} = 0, \\frac{\\delta V_\\rho}{\\delta z_{in}} = 0, \\frac{\\delta V_\\rho}{\\delta a_{in}} = 0, \\frac{\\delta V_\\rho}{\\delta b_{in}} = 0, \\frac{\\delta V_\\rho}{\\delta c_{in}} = 0, \\ldots \\ldots (S^1.)$$\n\nand therefore, by the six last equations of the groups $(M^1.)$ and $(N^1.)$, the multipliers would take the values\n\n$$\\lambda_1 = -x'_{in}, \\lambda_2 = -y'_{in}, \\lambda_3 = -z'_{in}, \\Lambda_1 = a'_{in}, \\Lambda_2 = b'_{in}, \\Lambda_3 = c'_{in}, \\ldots \\ldots (65.)$$\n\nand would reduce, by (60.) and (61.), the preceding 6 $n - 6$ equations of the same groups $(M^1.)$ and $(N^1.)$, to the forms\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta x_{i1}} = m_1 \\xi'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta x_{i2}} = m_2 \\xi'_2, \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta x_{in-1}} = m_{n-1} \\xi'_{n-1}, \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta y_{i1}} = m_1 \\eta'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta y_{i2}} = m_2 \\eta'_2, \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta y_{in-1}} = m_{n-1} \\eta'_{n-1}, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (T^1.) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta z_{i1}} = m_1 \\zeta'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta z_{i2}} = m_2 \\zeta'_2, \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta z_{in-1}} = m_{n-1} \\zeta'_{n-1}, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta a_{i1}} = -m_1 \\alpha'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta a_{i2}} = -m_2 \\alpha'_2, \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta a_{in-1}} = -m_{n-1} \\alpha'_{n-1}, \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta b_{i1}} = -m_1 \\beta'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta b_{i2}} = -m_2 \\beta'_2, \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta b_{in-1}} = -m_{n-1} \\beta'_{n-1}, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (U^1.) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta c_{i1}} = -m_1 \\gamma'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta c_{i2}} = -m_2 \\gamma'_2, \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_i}{\\delta c_{in-1}} = -m_{n-1} \\gamma'_{n-1}. \\]\n\n12. We might also express the relative action \\( V_i \\), not as a function of the centrobaric, but of some other internal coordinates, or marks of relative position. We might, for instance, express it and its variation as functions of the \\( 6n - 6 \\) independent internal coordinates \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\) already mentioned, and of their variations, defining these without any reference to the centre of gravity, by the equations\n\n\\[ \\xi_i = x_i - x_n, \\quad \\eta_i = y_i - y_n, \\quad \\zeta_i = z_i - z_n, \\]\n\n\\[ \\alpha_i = a_i - a_n, \\quad \\beta_i = b_i - b_n, \\quad \\gamma_i = c_i - c_n. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (66.) \\]\n\nFor all such transformations of \\( \\delta V_i \\), it is easy to establish a rule or law, which may be called the law of varying relative action (exactly analogous to the rule \\( B^1. \\)), namely, the following:\n\n\\[ \\delta V_i = \\Sigma \\left( \\frac{\\delta T_i}{\\delta \\eta'_i} \\right) \\delta \\eta_i - \\Sigma \\left( \\frac{\\delta T_i}{\\delta e'_i} \\right) \\delta e_i + t \\delta H_i + \\Sigma \\lambda_i \\delta \\phi_i + \\Sigma \\Lambda_i \\delta \\Phi_i; \\quad \\ldots \\quad (V^1.) \\]\n\nwhich implies that we are to express the half \\( T_i \\) of the relative living force of the system as a function of the rates of increase \\( \\eta'_i \\) of any marks of relative position; and after taking its variation with respect to these rates, to change their variations to the variations of the marks of position themselves; then to subtract the initial from the final value of the result, and to add the variations of the final and initial functions \\( \\phi_i, \\Phi_i \\), which enter into the equations of condition, if any, of the form \\( \\phi_i = 0, \\Phi_i = 0 \\), (connecting the final and initial marks of relative position,) multiplied respectively by undetermined factors \\( \\lambda_i, \\Lambda_i \\); and lastly, to equate the whole result to \\( \\delta V_i - t \\delta H_i \\), \\( H_i \\) being the quantity independent of the time in the equation (50.) of relative living force, and \\( V_i \\) being the relative action, of which we desired to express the variation.\n\nIt is not necessary to dwell here on the demonstration of this new rule \\( (V^1.) \\), which may easily be deduced from the principles already laid down; or by the calculus of variations from the law of relative living force, combined with the differential equations of the second order of relative motion.\nBut to give an example of its application, let us resume the problem already mentioned, namely to express $\\delta V_i$ by means of the $6n - 5$ independent variations $\\delta \\xi_i$, $\\delta \\eta_i$, $\\delta \\zeta_i$, $\\delta \\alpha_i$, $\\delta \\beta_i$, $\\delta \\gamma_i$, $\\delta H_i$. For this purpose we shall employ a known transformation of the relative living force $2T_p$ multiplied by the sum of the masses of the system, namely the following:\n\n$$2T_i \\Sigma m = \\Sigma . m_i m_k \\left\\{ (x'_i - x'_k)^2 + (y'_i - y'_k)^2 + (z'_i - z'_k)^2 \\right\\} : \\ldots \\ldots (67.)$$\n\nthe sign of summation $\\Sigma$ extending, in the second member, to all the combinations of points two by two, which can be formed without repetition. This transformation gives, by (66.), \n\n$$2T_i \\Sigma m = m_n \\Sigma_i . m (\\xi'^2 + \\eta'^2 + \\zeta'^2)$$\n\n$$+ \\Sigma_i . m_i m_k \\left\\{ (\\xi'_i - \\xi'_k)^2 + (\\eta'_i - \\eta'_k)^2 + (\\zeta'_i - \\zeta'_k)^2 \\right\\} ; \\ldots \\ldots (68.)$$\n\nthe sign of summation $\\Sigma_i$ extending only to the first $n - 1$ points of the system.

It may be here observed, that,\nalthough the consideration of the point, called usually the centre of gravity, is very simply suggested by the process of the tenth number, yet this internal centre is even more simply indicated by our early corollaries from the law of varying action; which show that the components of relative final velocities, in any system of attracting or repelling points, may be expressed by the differences of quantities of the form $\\frac{1}{m} \\delta V$, $\\frac{1}{m} \\delta V_y$, $\\frac{1}{m} \\delta V_z$: and therefore that in calculating these relative velocities, it is advantageous to introduce the final sums $\\Sigma m x$, $\\Sigma m y$, $\\Sigma m z$, and, for an analogous reason, the initial sums $\\Sigma m a$, $\\Sigma m b$, $\\Sigma m c$, among the marks of the extreme positions of the system, in the expression of the characteristic function $V$; because, in differentiating that expression for the calculation of relative velocities, those sums may be treated as constant.\n\n**On Systems of two Points, in general; Characteristic Function of the motion of any Binary System.**\n\n13. To illustrate the foregoing principles, which extend to any free system of points, however numerous, attracting or repelling one another, let us now consider, in particular, a system of two such points. For such a system, the known force-function $U$ becomes, by (2.), $$U = m_1 m_2 f(r), \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (71.)$$ $r$ being the mutual distance $$r = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2}, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (72.)$$ between the two points $m_1$, $m_2$, and $f(r)$ being a function of this distance such that its derivative or differential coefficient $f''(r)$ expresses the law of their repulsion or attraction, according as it is positive or negative. The known differential equations of motion, of the second order, are now, by (1.), comprised in the following formula: $$m_1(x''_1 \\delta x_1 + y''_1 \\delta y_1 + z''_1 \\delta z_1) + m_2(x''_2 \\delta x_2 + y''_2 \\delta y_2 + z''_2 \\delta z_2) = m_1 m_2 \\delta f(r); \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (73.)$$ they are therefore, separately, $$x''_1 = m_2 \\frac{\\delta f(r)}{\\delta x_1}, \\quad y''_1 = m_2 \\frac{\\delta f(r)}{\\delta y_1}, \\quad z''_1 = m_2 \\frac{\\delta f(r)}{\\delta z_1},$$ $$x''_2 = m_1 \\frac{\\delta f(r)}{\\delta x_2}, \\quad y''_2 = m_1 \\frac{\\delta f(r)}{\\delta y_2}, \\quad z''_2 = m_1 \\frac{\\delta f(r)}{\\delta z_2}. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (74.)$$\n\nThe problem of integrating these equations consists in proposing to assign, by their means, six relations between the time $t$, the masses $m_1 m_2$, the six varying coordinates $x_1 y_1 z_1 x_2 y_2 z_2$, and their initial values and initial rates of increase $a_1 b_1 c_1 a_2 b_2 c_2 a'_1 b'_1 c'_1 a'_2 b'_2 c'_2$. If we knew these six final integrals, and combined them with the initial form of the law of living force, or of the known intermediate integral $$\\frac{1}{2} m_1(x'_1^2 + y'_1^2 + z'_1^2) + \\frac{1}{2} m_2(x'_2^2 + y'_2^2 + z'_2^2) = m_1 m_2 f(r) + H; \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (75.)$$\nthat is, with the following formula,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} m_1 (a'_1)^2 + b'_1^2 + c'_1^2) + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 (a'_2)^2 + b'_2^2 + c'_2^2) = m_1 m_2 f(r_0) + H, \\quad \\ldots \\quad (76.) \\]\n\nin which \\( r_0 \\) is the initial distance\n\n\\[ r_0 = \\sqrt{(a_1 - a_2)^2 + (b_1 - b_2)^2 + (c_1 - c_2)^2}, \\quad \\ldots \\quad (77.) \\]\n\nand \\( H \\) is a constant quantity, introduced by integration; we could, by the combination of these seven relations, determine the time \\( t \\), and the six initial components of velocity \\( a'_1 b'_1 c'_1 a'_2 b'_2 c'_2 \\), as functions of the twelve final and initial coordinates \\( x_1 y_1 z_1 x_2 y_2 z_2 a_1 b_1 c_1 a_2 b_2 c_2 \\), and of the quantity \\( H \\), (involving also the masses:) we could therefore determine whatever else depends on the manner and time of motion of this system of two points, as a function of the same extreme coordinates and of the same quantity \\( H \\). In particular, we could determine the action, or accumulated living force of the system, namely,\n\n\\[ V = m_1 \\int_0^t (x'_1^2 + y'_1^2 + z'_1^2) dt + m_2 \\int_0^t (x'_2^2 + y'_2^2 + z'_2^2) dt, \\quad \\ldots \\quad (A^2.) \\]\n\nas a function of those thirteen quantities \\( x_1 y_1 z_1 x_2 y_2 z_2 a_1 b_1 c_1 a_2 b_2 c_2 H \\): and might then calculate the variation of this function,\n\n\\[ \\delta V = \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_1} \\delta x_1 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_1} \\delta y_1 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_1} \\delta z_1 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_2} \\delta x_2 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_2} \\delta y_2 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_2} \\delta z_2 \\]\n\\[ + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_1} \\delta a_1 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_1} \\delta b_1 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_1} \\delta c_1 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_2} \\delta a_2 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_2} \\delta b_2 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_2} \\delta c_2 \\]\n\\[ + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta H} \\delta H. \\quad \\ldots \\quad (B^2.) \\]\n\nBut the essence of our method consists in forming previously the expression of this variation, by our law of varying action, namely,\n\n\\[ \\delta V = m_1 (x'_1 \\delta x_1 - a'_1 \\delta a_1 + y'_1 \\delta y_1 - b'_1 \\delta b_1 + z'_1 \\delta z_1 - c'_1 \\delta c_1) \\]\n\\[ + m_2 (x'_2 \\delta x_2 - a'_2 \\delta a_2 + y'_2 \\delta y_2 - b'_2 \\delta b_2 + z'_2 \\delta z_2 - c'_2 \\delta c_2) \\]\n\\[ + t \\delta H; \\quad \\ldots \\quad (C^2.) \\]\n\nand in considering \\( V \\) as a characteristic function of the motion, from the form of which may be deduced all the intermediate and all the final integrals of the known differential equations, by resolving the expression \\( (C^2.) \\) into the following separate groups, (included in \\( C. \\) and \\( D. \\)),\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_1} = m_1 x'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_1} = m_1 y'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_1} = m_1 z'_1; \\quad \\ldots \\quad (D^2.) \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_1} = -m_1 a'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_1} = -m_1 b'_1, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_1} = -m_1 c'_1; \\quad \\ldots \\quad (E^2.) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_2} = -m_2 a'_2, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_2} = -m_2 b'_2, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_2} = -m_2 c'_2; \\quad \\ldots \\]\nbesides this other equation, which had occurred before,\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta H} = t. \\]  \n\n(E.)\n\nBy this new method, the difficulty of integrating the six known equations of motion of the second order (74.), is reduced to the search and differentiation of a single function \\( V \\); and to find the form of this function, we are to employ the following pair of partial differential equations of the first order:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2m_1} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_1} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_1} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_1} \\right)^2 \\right\\} + \\frac{1}{2m_2} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta x_2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta y_2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta z_2} \\right)^2 \\right\\} \\\\\n= m_1 m_2 f'(r) + H,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n(F\\(^2\\).)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2m_1} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_1} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_1} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_1} \\right)^2 \\right\\} + \\frac{1}{2m_2} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta a_2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta b_2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta c_2} \\right)^2 \\right\\} \\\\\n= m_1 m_2 f'(r_0) + H,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n(G\\(^2\\).)\n\ncombined with some simple considerations.

We shall not enter, on this occasion, into any details of such application; but we may remark, that the circumstance of the characteristic function involving only the elliptic chord and the sum of the extreme radii, (besides the mean distance and the sum of the masses,) affords, by our general method, a new proof of the well-known theorem that the elliptic time also depends on the same chord and sum of radii; and gives a new expression for the law of this dependence, namely,\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2 a^3}{\\mu} \\frac{\\delta w}{\\delta a}. \\]\n\nWe may remark also, that the same form of the characteristic function of elliptic motion, conducts, by our general method, to the following curious, but not novel property, of the ellipse, that if any two tangents be drawn to such a curve, from any common point outside, these tangents subtend equal angles at one focus;\nthey subtend also equal angles at the other. Reciprocally, if any plane curve possess this property, when referred to a fixed point in its own plane, which may be taken as the origin of polar coordinates \\( r, \\theta \\), the curve must satisfy the following equation in mixed differences:\n\n\\[\n\\cotan \\left( \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{2} \\right) \\cdot \\Delta \\frac{1}{r} = (\\Delta + 2) \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\frac{1}{r}, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (115.)\n\\]\n\nwhich may be brought to the following form,\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{d}{d\\theta} + \\frac{d^3}{d\\theta^3} \\right) \\frac{1}{r} = 0, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (116.)\n\\]\n\nand therefore gives, by integration,\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{p}{1 + e \\cos(\\theta - \\varphi)}; \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (117.)\n\\]\n\nthe curve is, consequently, a conic section, and the fixed point is one of its foci.\n\nThe properties of parabolic are included as limiting cases in those of elliptic motion, and may be deduced from them by making\n\n\\[\nH_i = 0, \\text{ or } a = \\infty; \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (118.)\n\\]\n\nand therefore the characteristic function \\( w \\) and the time \\( t \\), in parabolic as well as in elliptic motion, are functions of the chord and of the sum of the radii. By thus making a infinite in the foregoing expressions, we find, for parabolic motion, the partial differential equations\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\sigma} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\tau} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\mu}{\\sigma + \\tau}, \\quad \\left( \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\sigma} - \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\tau} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\mu}{\\sigma - \\tau}; \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (T^3.)\n\\]\n\nand in fact the parabolic form of the simplified characteristic function \\( w \\) may easily be shown to be\n\n\\[\nw = 2 \\sqrt{\\mu} (\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\tau} \\mp \\sqrt{\\sigma - \\tau}), \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (U^3.)\n\\]\n\n\\( \\tau \\) being, as before, the chord, and \\( \\sigma \\) the sum of the radii; while the analogous limit of the expression \\( (S^3.) \\), for the time, is\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1}{6 \\sqrt{\\mu}} \\left\\{ (\\sigma + \\tau)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\mp (\\sigma - \\tau)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\right\\}; \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (V^3.)\n\\]\n\nwhich latter is a known expression.\n\nThe formulae \\( (K^3.) \\) and \\( (L^3.) \\), to the comparison of which we have reduced the study of elliptic motion, extend to hyperbolic motion also; and in any binary system, with Newton's law of attraction, the simplified characteristic function \\( w \\) may be expressed by the definite integral\n\n\\[\nw = \\int_{-\\tau}^{\\tau} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma + \\tau} - \\frac{\\mu}{4a}} \\cdot d\\tau, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (W^3.)\n\\]\n\nthis function \\( w \\) being still connected with the relative action \\( V_i \\) by the equation \\( (H^3.) \\); while the time \\( t \\), which may always be deduced from this function, by the law of varying action, is represented by this other connected integral,\n\\[ t = \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{-\\tau}^{\\tau} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma + \\tau} - \\frac{\\mu}{4a} \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} d\\tau : \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (X^3.) \\]\n\nprovided that, within the extent of these integrations, the radical does not vanish nor become infinite. When this condition is not satisfied, we may still express the simplified characteristic function \\( w \\), and the time \\( t \\), by the following analogous integrals:\n\n\\[ w = \\int_{\\tau_i}^{\\tau_f} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma_i} - \\frac{\\mu}{a}} d\\sigma_p , \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (Y^3.) \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ t = \\int_{\\tau_i}^{\\tau_f} \\pm \\left( \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma_i} - \\frac{\\mu}{a} \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} d\\sigma_p , \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (Z^3.) \\]\n\nin which we have put for abridgement\n\n\\[ \\sigma_i = \\frac{\\sigma + \\tau}{2}, \\quad \\tau_f = \\frac{\\sigma - \\tau}{2}, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (119.) \\]\n\nand in which it is easy to determine the signs of the radicals.

But if we observe that these unknown coefficients enter only by their squares and products, we shall perceive that it offers a general method of improving an approximation in any problem of dynamics. For if the first part \\(V_1\\) be an approximate value of the whole sought function \\(V\\), the second part \\(V_2\\) will be small, and the term \\(T_2\\) will not only be also small, but will be in general of a higher order of smallness; we shall therefore in general improve an approximate value \\(V_1\\) of the characteristic function \\(V\\), by adding to it the definite integral,\nthough this is not, like (B5.), a perfectly rigorous expression for the remaining part of the function. And in calculating this integral (K5.), for the improvement of an approximation $V_1$, we may employ the following analogous approximations to the rigorous formulæ (D.) and (E.),\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta a_1} = -m_1 a'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta b_1} = -m_1 b'_1; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta c_1} = -m_1 c'_1; \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta a_n} = -m_n a'_n; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta b_n} = -m_n b'_n; \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta c_n} = -m_n c'_n;$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta H} = t;$$\n\nor with any other marks of final and initial position, (instead of rectangular coordinates,) the following approximate forms of the rigorous equations (S.),\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta e'_1} = -\\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_1}, \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta e'_2} = -\\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_2}, \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\frac{\\delta V_1}{\\delta e'_{3n}} = -\\frac{\\delta T_0}{\\delta e'_{3n}},$$\n\ntogether with the formula (M5.); by which new formulæ the manner of motion of the system is approximately though not rigorously expressed.\n\nIt is easy to extend these remarks to problems of relative motion, and to show that in such problems we have the rigorous transformation\n\n$$V_2 = \\int_0^t (T_i - T_{i1} + T_{i2}) \\, dt,$$\n\nand the approximate expression\n\n$$V_2 = \\int_0^t (T_i - T_{i1}) \\, dt,$$\n\n$V_{i1}$ being any approximate value of the function $V_i$ of relative motion, and $V_{i2}$ being the correction of this value; and $T_{i1}, T_{i2}$ being homogeneous functions of the second dimension, composed of the partial differential coefficients of these two parts $V_{i1}, V_{i2}$, in the same way as $T_i$ is composed of the coefficients of the whole function $V_i$. These general remarks may usefully be illustrated by a particular but extensive application.\n\nApplication of the foregoing method to the case of a Ternary or Multiple System, with any laws of attraction or repulsion, and with one predominant mass.\n\n20. The value (68.), for the relative living force $2T_i$ of a system, reduces itself successively to the following parts, $2T_i^{(1)}, 2T_i^{(2)}, \\ldots 2T_i^{(n-1)}$, when we suppose that\nall the \\( n - 1 \\) first masses vanish, with the exception of each successively; namely, to the part\n\n\\[\n2 T_i^{(1)} = \\frac{m_1 m_n}{m_1 + m_n} (\\xi'_1^2 + \\eta'_1^2 + \\zeta'_1^2),\n\\]\n\nwhen only \\( m_1, m_n \\) do not vanish; the part\n\n\\[\n2 T_i^{(2)} = \\frac{m_2 m_n}{m_2 + m_n} (\\xi'_2^2 + \\eta'_2^2 + \\zeta'_2^2),\n\\]\n\nwhen all but \\( m_2, m_n \\) vanish; and so on, as far as the part\n\n\\[\n2 T_i^{(n-1)} = \\frac{m_{n-1} m_n}{m_{n-1} + m_n} (\\xi'_{n-1}^2 + \\eta'_{n-1}^2 + \\zeta'_{n-1}^2),\n\\]\n\nwhich remains, when only the two last masses are retained.

In like manner, the formula (L$^6$. ) for the time of motion in a binary system, which is only an approximation when the system is considered as multiple, may be rigorously corrected for perturbation by adding to it an analogous term deduced from the disturbing part $V_{i2}$ of the whole characteristic function; that is, by changing it to the following:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta g^{(i)}} + \\frac{\\delta V_{i2}}{\\delta H_i}, \\quad (\\text{Y}^6.)$$\n\nwhich gives, for this other coefficient of $w^{(i)}$, the corrected and rigorous expression\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta g^{(i)}} = t - \\frac{\\delta V_{i2}}{\\delta H_i}. \\quad (\\text{Z}^6.)$$\n\n$V_{i2}$ being here supposed so chosen as to be rigorously the correction of $V_{i1}$. If therefore by the theory of binary systems, or by eliminating $g^{(i)}$ between the four equations (K$^6$.)(L$^6$.), we have deduced expressions for the three varying relative coordinates $\\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta_i$ as functions of the time $t$, and of the six initial quantities $\\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, \\alpha'_i, \\beta'_i, \\gamma'_i$ which may be thus denoted,\nwe shall know that the following relations are rigorously and identically true,\n\n\\[ \\xi_i = \\varphi_1 (\\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, \\alpha'_i, \\beta'_i, \\gamma'_i, t), \\]\n\\[ \\eta_i = \\varphi_2 (\\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, \\alpha'_i, \\beta'_i, \\gamma'_i, t), \\]\n\\[ \\zeta_i = \\varphi_3 (\\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, \\alpha'_i, \\beta'_i, \\gamma'_i, t); \\]\n\nand consequently that these relations will still be rigorously true when we substitute for the four coefficients of \\( w^{(i)} \\) their rigorous values (X\\(^6\\)) and (Z\\(^6\\)) for the case of a multiple system. We may thus retain in rigour for any multiple system the final integrals (A\\(^7\\)) of the motion of a binary system, if only we add to the initial components \\( \\alpha'_i, \\beta'_i, \\gamma'_i \\) of relative velocity, and to the time \\( t \\), the following perturbational terms:\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\alpha'_i = \\sum_{k} \\frac{m_k}{m_k + m_n} \\frac{\\delta w^{(k)}}{\\delta \\alpha_k} + \\frac{1}{m_i} \\frac{\\delta V_{\\beta_i}}{\\delta \\alpha_i} + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_{l} \\frac{\\delta V_{\\beta_l}}{\\delta \\alpha_i}, \\]\n\\[ \\Delta \\beta'_i = \\sum_{k} \\frac{m_k}{m_k + m_n} \\frac{\\delta w^{(k)}}{\\delta \\beta_k} + \\frac{1}{m_i} \\frac{\\delta V_{\\beta_i}}{\\delta \\beta_i} + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_{l} \\frac{\\delta V_{\\beta_l}}{\\delta \\beta_i}, \\]\n\\[ \\Delta \\gamma'_i = \\sum_{k} \\frac{m_k}{m_k + m_n} \\frac{\\delta w^{(k)}}{\\delta \\gamma_k} + \\frac{1}{m_i} \\frac{\\delta V_{\\beta_i}}{\\delta \\gamma_i} + \\frac{1}{m_n} \\sum_{l} \\frac{\\delta V_{\\beta_l}}{\\delta \\gamma_i}, \\]\n\\[ \\Delta t = -\\frac{\\delta V_{\\beta_i}}{\\delta H_i}. \\]\n\nIn the same way, if the theory of binary systems, or the elimination of \\( g^{(i)} \\) between the four equations (I\\(^6\\)) (L\\(^6\\)), has given three intermediate integrals, of the form\n\n\\[ \\xi'_i = \\psi_1 (\\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta_i, \\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, t), \\]\n\\[ \\eta'_i = \\psi_2 (\\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta_i, \\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, t), \\]\n\\[ \\zeta'_i = \\psi_3 (\\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta_i, \\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, t); \\]\n\nwe can conclude that the following equations are rigorous and identical,\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta \\xi_i} = \\psi_1 (\\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta_i, \\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, \\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta g^{(i)}}), \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta \\eta_i} = \\psi_2 (\\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta_i, \\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, \\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta g^{(i)}}), \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta \\zeta_i} = \\psi_3 (\\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta_i, \\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i, \\frac{\\delta w^{(i)}}{\\delta g^{(i)}}). \\]\nand must therefore be still true, when, in passing to a multiple system, we change the coefficients of \\( w^{(i)} \\) to their rigorous values \\((W^6)\\) \\((Z^6)\\).
