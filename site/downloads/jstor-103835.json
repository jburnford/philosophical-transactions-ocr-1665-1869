S. containing the Account of a remarkable Generation of Insects; of an Earthquake; and of an Explosion in the Air.\n\nAnnapolis Oct. 27, 1732,\nin Maryland.\n\nSIR,\n\nI send you herewith some Leaves of a Fly-Tree (so it is call'd by some People) from whence vast Swarms of Flies have been observed to issue; having heard strange Stories about it, I desired a Person who went to see it, to bring me some of the fly-bearing Leaves; about the latter End of June last he brought me some Leaves, on which was fix'd a tough little Bag, as big as the Husk of a Philbert, but is now very much shrunk with drying. It was of a dusky green Colour; I cut it open, and a Fly, like a Gnat, came out of it; I discover'd no more Flies, 'till looking at it with a Glass, I could discern something moving amongst the bluish Pulp, and after a while observ'd that it contain'd many red Grubs, very small, without Wings; I bound up the Nidus, and next Morning the Grubs had gotten bluish Wings, and their Body was of a grayish Colour; there was a great Number of them, but they soon flew away. I went to see the Tree; its Bark and Leaf resembles a Male Mulberry, the Leaves were plentifully stock'd with these Bags; I open'd several of them which were plentifully stock'd with these Insects. Amongst all the Excrements which\nwhich I have seen on Leaves, I have observed none like these. When the Leaf is small they are scarcely discernable, they grow with the Leaf, which is not discolour'd or crumpled by them. I have read Rhedis's curious Treatise of the Generation of Insects, but found no Account therein of any of their Nests like these.\n\nOn Tuesday the 5th of September last, about Eleven in the Morning, an Earthquake was felt in diverse Places in Maryland; the most particular Account I have heard of it was from Mr. Chew. It shook his House for some time, and stopp'd the Pendulum of his Clock; during its Continuance, a rumbling Noise was heard in the Air, and many People who did not feel the Shaking, as well as those who did, complained of a Dizziness in their Heads, and Sickness at their Stomachs: At the same time, I have been credibly informed, it was felt in Pennsylvania, and New-England; but I have not heard whether it extended to North or South Carolina.\n\nHaving mentioned the Earthquake above, I shall mention a surprizing Phænomenon that happen'd in 1725, something of the same Nature, but with some remarkable Difference, as it was lately sent me by Capt. Richard Smith.\n\nOctob. 22, 1725, about Two in the Afternoon, the Sky being very serene and clear, Capt. Smith heard, as he then thought, the Noise of a Gun, of a Minion Size, about 12 Miles Eastward from him, which Noise was repeated at least 20 times, but at unequal Distances of time, and soon afterwards followed a very loud Explosion, as if a Ship had been blown up: Upon Enquiry, he was told by several Persons who lived about 12 Miles\n12 Miles distant from his House, that they were greatly amazed with the Appearance of an extraordinary Brightness in the Zenith, resembling Flame, which continued for about 5 Minutes, and then the imaginary Guns were fired twenty or thirty times, which so disturb'd the Atmosphere, that the Birds lost the Use of their Wings, and fell to the Ground in great Disorder. This Noise was heard about fifty Miles each Way, from the bright Appearance aforesaid.—Thus far the Captain.\n\nI heard the Noise (as most People did) but saw not the Brightness at Patapsko, being about 60 Miles from the Captain's House. I was told that the Shock, occasioned by the Noise, threw down Pewter that was set to dry against the Side of a House. As this in some manner resembled an Earthquake (which has scarce ever before disturb'd our Northern World) I should be glad to know your Opinion of such Explosions. From your humble Servant,\n\nRichard Lewis.\n\nIX. A Letter from Mr. Evan Davis to Mr. John Eames, F.R.S. concerning some Children inoculated with the Small-Pox, at Haverford-West in Pembrokeshire.\n\nSIR,\n\nHAD I known in the Beginning of last Spring that an Account of the Success of Inoculation in the Small-Pox, practis'd here about that time, would be agreeable to you, as you signify in your last, I would",
