XXIII. Astronomical Observations made by Samuel Holland Esquire, His Majesty's Surveyor General of Lands for the Northern District of North America, for ascertaining the Longitude of several Places in the said District. Communicated by the Astronomer Royal.

Redde, Jan. 20, 1774.

Kittery Point, in the province of Main, in Piscataqua harbour.

Latitude {by result of repeated observations, of O and fixed *'s, made with Bird's astronomical quadrant,} 43° 4' 27'' N.

Observed, with Dollond's 12 feet refracting telescope,

Immersion and Emersions of 4's satellites as follow,

| Apparent time. |
|----------------|
| h | m | s |
| 1771 April 11th, an immersion of the 1st, at 15 43 30 |
| 27th, same | same | 14 1 43 |
| May 4th, same | same, | 15 55 54 |

The variation of the compass at this place, is 7° 46' West.

PORTSMOUTH,
PORTSMOUTH, province of NEW HAMPSHIRE.

Latitude { by result of repeated observations, } of \( \odot \) and fixed \( * \)'s, made with \( \text{BIRD}'s \) astronomical quadrant,

\( 43^\circ 4' 15'' \) N.

Observed, with DOLLOND's 12 feet refracting telescope,

Immersions and Emersions of \( 24 \)'s satellites as follow,

| Date   | Event                  | Apparent time |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| Sept. 6th | an emersion of the 2d, at | 11 9 20       |
|        | 18th, same             | 1st, 9 42 35  |
| Oct. 11th | same                   | same, 10 5 4  |
| Nov. 3d    | same                   | same, 10 23 54 |
|         | 9th, same              | 2d, 10 51 39  |
|         | 12th, same             | 1st, 6 48 1   |
| * 19th | same                   | same, 8 42 41 |
| 23d     | immersed entirely      | 3d, 6 8 6    |
|         | same, began to emerge, | same, 9 28 14 |
| Dec. 4th | an emersion            | 2d, 7 50 0    |
|         | 5th, same              | 1st, 6 57 44  |

The VARIATION of the COMPASS at this place is \( 7^\circ 48' \) West.

All these observations were made by time kept by GRAHAM's time-piece, with a gridiron pendulum, rectified occasionally by equal altitudes of the Sun, corrected agreeably to the tables of M. DE LA LANDE, for the alteration of the declination in the intervals of corresponding observations.

SAMUEL HOLLAND.

* This satellite in emerging was in conjunction with another, which occasioned such a deception as to render this observation uncertain about 20 seconds sooner than what is marked here.
