gas was made to pass and repass into and from the lungs about thirty times in a minute. At first, the heart acted one hundred and twenty times in a minute, with regularity and strength; the thermometer, in the rectum, rose to 100°. At the end of an hour, the heart acted as frequently as before, but more feebly; the blood in the arteries was very little more florid than that in the veins; the thermometer in the rectum had fallen to 93°. The gum bottle was then removed. On causing a stream of the gas, which it contained, to pass through lime-water, the presence of carbonic acid was indicated by the liquid being instantly rendered turbid. The proportion of carbonic acid was not accurately determined; but it appeared to form about one-half of the quantity of gas in the bottle.
