Meridianorum habito respectu.\n\nIn assignandis autem Medio, Fine, Quantitate & Duratione Ephemerides Anglicæ Gallicis sunt accuratiores; Finis enim ad Anglicis ponitur ad 12h. 14m. a Gallicis vero ad 12h. 29m. Quantitas ab illis supputata sex fere Digitorum; ab his 7½ Dig.\n\nA further Assertion of the Propositions concerning the Magnitude, &c. of London, contained in two Essays in Political Arithmetic; mentioned in Philos. Transact. Numb. 183; together with a Vindication of the said Essays from the Objections of some Learned Persons of the French Nation, by Sr. W. Petty Knt. R.S.S.\n\n1. It could not be expected that an Assertion of London's being bigger than Paris and Rouen, or than Paris and Rome put together, and bigger than any City of the World, should escape uncontradicted, and 'tis expected that I (if continuing in that Perswasion) should make some Reply to these contradictions.\n\n2. I begin with the Ingenious Author of the Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres, who faith that Rey in Persia is far bigger than London; for that in the 6th Century of Christianity (I suppose An. 550) It had 15000, or rather 44 thousand Moschees or Mahometan Temples. To which I reply, that I hope this Objector is but in jest, for that Mahomet was not borne till about the Year 570, and had no Moschees till about 50 Years after.\n\n3. The next is the excellent Monsieur Auzout from Rome, who is content, that London, Westminster, and Southwark-with the contiguous Housing may have as many People as Paris and its Suburbs; and but faintly denyeth, that all the Housing within the Bills, may have almost as many People as Paris and Rouen, but faith that several Parishes inserted\ninto these Bills, are distant from, and not contiguous with London, and that Grant so understood it.\n\n4. To which (as his main, if not only Objection) we answer, viz. That the London Bills appear in Grants Book to have been, since the Year 1636, as they now are. 2. that about 50 Years since, 3 or 4 Parishes formerly distant, were join'd, by interposed Buildings to the Bulk of the City, and therefore then inserted into the Bills. 3. That since 50 Years the whole Buildings being more than double, have perfected that Union, so as there is no House within the said Bills, from which one may not call to some other House. 4. All this is confirm'd by authority of the King and City, and so long Custom. 5. That there are but three Parishes under any Colour of this Exception, which are scarce a two and fiftieth part of the whole.\n\n5. Upon sight of Monsieur Auzouts large Letter, I made Remarques upon every Paragraph thereof, but suppressing it (because it lookt like a War against one with whome I intended none, whereas in truth it was but a reconciling Explication of some Doubts, and therefore) I have chosen the shorter and sweeter way of answering Monsieur Auzout, as followeth, viz.\n\nConcerning the Number of People in London, as also in Paris, Roven, and Rome, viz.\n\nMonsieur Auzout allegeth an authentic Register, that there are 23223 Houses in Paris, wherein do live above8othousand Families, and therefore supposing 3½ Families to live in every of the said Houses one with another; the Number of Families will be 81280; and Monsieur Auzout also allowing 6 Heads to each Family, the utmost Number of People in Paris, according to Mr. Auzouts Opinion, will be\nThe Medium of the Paris Burials was allowed by Monsieur Auzout to be 19887, and that there dyed 3506 unnecessarily out of L'Hotel Dieu, wherefore deducting the said last Number, the neat Standard for Burials at Paris, will be 16381, so as the Number of People there, allowing but one to Dye out of 30 (which is more advantageous to Paris than Monsieur Auzouts Opinion of one to Dye out of 25) the Number of People at Paris will be 491430; more than by Monsieur Auzouts last mentioned Accompt.\n\nThe Medium of the said two Paris Accompts is—488055\n\nThe Medium of the London Burialls is 23212, which Multiplyed by 30 (as has been done for Paris) the Number of the People there will bee.\n\nThe Number of Houses at London appears by the Register to bee 105315. Whereunto adding a 10th part or 10531, as the least Number of double Families that can be supposed in London, the total of Families will be 11540: and allowing 6 Heads for each Family, as was done for Paris, the total of the People at London will be.\n\nThe Medium of the 2 last London Accounts is—695718\n\nThe People of Paris according to the above-said Account is 488055.\n\nOf Roven according to Monsieur Auzouts utmost Demand, 80000.\n\nOf Rome according to his own Report thereof, 125000.\nSo as there are more People at London, than at Paris, Rouen, and Rome by\n\nMemorandum, that the Parishes of Islington, Newington, and Hackney, for which only there is any Colour of Non-contiguity, is not a two and fiftieth part of what is contained in the Bills of Mortality; and consequently London without them, hath more People than Paris and Rouen put together, by\n\nSeveral other Estimates, viz.\n\nI. That London alone is equal to Paris, Rouen, and Rome, as aforesaid.\nII. That London, Bristol, and Dublin are equal to Paris, Amsterdam, and Venice.\nIII. That London alone is to Amsterdam, Venice, and Rouen, as 7 to 4.\nIV. That London and Bristol are equal to any four Cities of France.\nV. That Dublin is probably equal to the second best City, of any Kingdom or State in Christendome.\nVI. That London, for ought appears, is the greatest City of the World, but manifestly the greatest Emporium.",
