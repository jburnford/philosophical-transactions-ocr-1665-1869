VI. Some Thoughts and Conjectures concerning the Cause of Elasticity, by J. T. Desaguliers, LL.D. F.R.S.

Attraction and Repulsion seem to be settled by the Great Creator as first Principles in Nature; that is, as the first of second Causes; so that we are not solicitous about their Causes, and think it enough to deduce other Things from them. If Elasticity was admitted as a first Cause, (as it is by some) it is thought we should admit of too many principal Causes in Nature, which is contrary to the Rules of good Philosophy. Philosophers therefore have endeavour'd to deduce Elasticity from Attraction, or from Repulsion, or from both. It is observ'd, that the same Particles that repel each other strongly, will
