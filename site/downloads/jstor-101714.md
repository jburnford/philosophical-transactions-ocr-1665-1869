use of those that are desirous to employ it, not only for this purpose of curing the Gout, but also for that of removing the Epilepsy, Madness, and Catalepsy.

The other Treatise contains several happy cures of strange ruptures and other remarkable accidents of the Womb; the manner of performing the Cesarean Section, of curing the falling down of the womb, of curing wombs closed, and several closures of the Vagina uteri; of a happy cure of a Child's fundament closed, and of the Rupture of a Bladder; of the firm Union of the dura mater to the skull; of the modern Use and Abuse of Trepanning, which is here shew'd not to be so often necessary, nor useful, as is commonly pretended; of grievous wounds in the Head, well cured without the Trepans; of the manner of cutting Hare-mouths, and several successful operations thereof; of the happy cure of a wounded Nerve; and of an uncommon cure perform'd upon a woman, out of whose thigh a great piece of the bone was separated, without shortening her leg, or hindring the motion of her going.

V. New and Curious Observations of the Art of Curing the VENEREAL DISEASE, &c. Written in French by M. de Blegny, Chirurgeon to the French Queen; English'd by Walter Harrys, M.D. lately Fellow of New Colledge in Oxford. London, 1676. in 8°.

THE Ingenious Author, and the Learn'd and diligent Interpreter of this piece have represented unto us therein the Nature, Origine, Causes, Differences, Signs and Prognosticks of this Distemper; and given us divers considerable Observations on the Means to cure the same when it is but Particular, (that is, fixt to some parts) as also on the Natural and Critical Motions, when it turns to be Universal, and hath infected the whole body; and likewise on the Means serving to raise the Artificial Crises of it; together with an explication of the true Method of artificially raising the Crises of the Universal Pox.

That which seems most peculiar to this Book is, that the Author pretends to have established the Cause of the Pox upon Principles wholly new viz. the Mixture and Confusion of the semen of many different persons, which at length exert their activities in this heterogeneous fermentation, degenerating into such a high malignancy as this Disease carries with it. But though the Author renders a New Cause of this Malady, yet hath he the testimony of the Medical Faculty of Paris, that they have not found any thing in his Method of Curing, that is not conformable to ancient received Maxims; they judging withal, that the New Observations, which it doth contain, will serve to increase an emulation, for the future, towards a more diligent search of the truth of things less known.
