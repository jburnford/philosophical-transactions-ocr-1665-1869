An Account of the Dissection of a Dog that had Mercury injected into one of the Jugulars. By Dr. Christoph.

(which I received this Morning) you may please to present my humble Duty and Service to the Lord Chief Justice Holt, with this Account of the Seat of Easter, of which he asketh.\n\nThat there may be some little Mistakes in the Calendar of the Common-Prayer Book (as now Printed) I shall not deny.\n\nBut (as to the present Point) Easter was observed this Year, according to the Rules, so understood as was intended, though there may seem to be wanting a Rubrick to make it plain.\n\nThe fundamental Rule of the Nicene Council (which we pretend to follow) for the keeping of Easter, is to this purpose:\n\nEaster-Day is to be that Sunday which falls upon, or next after, the first Full Moon which happens next after the Vernal Equinox.\n\nWhich Vernal Equinox was then observed to fall on the One and Twentieth of March: And (in the Paschal Tables) is yet reputed to fall; (though it do now fall on the Eleventh of March, or sometimes the Tenth of March.)\n\nEc.
