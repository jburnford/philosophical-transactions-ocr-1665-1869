At $1^h\\ 22'$, its distance from Rigel\nwas $7^\\circ\\ 6'$; at $1^h\\ 24'$, from Betelgeuse $15^\\circ\\ 53'$; and\nat $1^h\\ 36'$, its distance from Sirius was $17^\\circ\\ 36'$.\n\nThis will be sufficient for you to find its place by.\nThe observations, together with above twenty others,\nwere made with a little Hadley's quadrant, and may\nmost of them, I believe, be depended on to about\ntwo or three minutes; but some perhaps may err\nfour or five minutes.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCambridge, Jan. 9, 1760.\n\nJohn Michell.\n\nXLIII. An Account of the same Comet; by\nNicolas Munckley, of Lincoln's-Inn, Esq;\n\nRead Jan. 17, January 9, 1760, I observed what ap-\npeared to me to be evidently a comet,\nwest of the constellation of Orion, or (to speak more\nastronomically and exactly) over the two stars marked\n$\\mu$ and $\\nu$ in the river Eridanus, but nearer the latter\nthan the former; right ascension, about 66 deg. de-\nclination, about 3 deg. S. It was something dimmer\nand larger than either of these stars; and through a\ntelescope, appeared magnified, and surrounded with\na broad, faint, ill-defined haziness, like the last\ncomet, such as plainly distinguished it from any\nthing else in the heavens. It seemed, even between\nthe times I observed it that evening, to have a sen-\nsible motion towards the north-west (i.e. nearer the\nzenith, and contrary to the order of the signs): for\nthough at first I apprehend its place to be as above,\non reviewing it, two or three hours afterwards, it\nwas more over the star \\( \\nu \\), and a little to the west-\nward of it.\n\nThis phenomenon was seen the night before (viz.\nthe 8th, when I was in London), by two or three\npersons, who mentioned it to me: but though they\nparticularly took notice of it as different from other\nstars, they were not astronomers enough to give any\nexact account, either of its place or appearance.\n\nThe evenings following the 9th were cloudy, till\nthe 13th, which, though far from being very clear;\nallowed me however, at times, to see the constella-\ntion Orion, and westward of it, as far as Cetus, &c.\nI saw particularly the stars \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\nu \\), mentioned be-\nfore, and the places above-referred to over them;\nbut I saw nothing any more of the comet.\n\nHampstead.
