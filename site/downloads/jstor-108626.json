Cayley, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nReceived October 30,—Read December 11, 1856.\n\nA curve of the third order, or cubic curve, is the locus represented by an equation such as $U=(x,y,z)^3=0$; and it appears by my \"Third Memoir on Quantics,\" that it is proper to consider, in connexion with the curve of the third order $U=0$, and its Hessian $HU=0$ (which is also a curve of the third order), two curves of the third class, viz. the curves represented by the equations $PU=0$ and $QU=0$. These equations, I say, represent curves of the third class; in fact, $PU$ and $QU$ are contravariants of $U$, and therefore, when the variables $x, y, z$ of $U$ are considered as point coordinates, the variables $\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta$ of $PU$ and $QU$ must be considered as line coordinates, and the curves will be curves of the third class. I propose (in analogy with the form of the word Hessian) to call the two curves in question the Pippian and Quippian respectively. A geometrical definition of the Pippian was readily found; the curve is in fact Steiner's curve $R_0$ mentioned in the memoir \"Allgemeine Eigenschaften der algebraischen Curve,\" Crelle, t. xlvi. pp. 1–6, in the particular case of a basis-curve of the third order; and I also found that the Pippian might be considered as occurring implicitly in my \"Mémoire sur les Courbes du Troisième Ordre,\" Liouville, t. ix. p. 285, and \"Nouvelles Remarques sur les Courbes du Troisième Ordre,\" Liouville, t. x. p. 102. As regards the Quippian, I have not succeeded in obtaining a satisfactory geometrical definition; but the search after it led to a variety of theorems, relating chiefly to the first-mentioned curve, and the results of the investigation are contained in the present memoir. Some of these results are due to Mr. Salmon, with whom I was in correspondence on the subject. The character of the results makes it difficult to develope them in a systematic order; but the results are given in such connexion one with another as I have been able to present them in. Considering the object of the memoir to be the establishment of a distinct geometrical theory of the Pippian, the leading results will be found summed up in the nine different definitions or modes of generation of the Pippian, given in the concluding number. In the course of the memoir I give some further developments relating to the theory in the memoirs in Liouville above referred to, showing its relation to the Pippian, and the analogy with theorems of Hesse in relation to the Hessian.\n\nArticle No. 1.—Definitions, &c.\n\n1. It may be convenient to premise as follows:—Considering, in connexion with a curve of the third order or cubic, a point, we have—\n\n(a) The first or conic polar of the point.\n(b) The second or line polar of the point.\n\nThe meaning of these terms is well known, and they require no explanation.\nNext, considering, in connexion with the cubic, a line—\n\n(c) The first or conic polars of each point of the line meet in four points, which are the four poles of the line.\n\n(d) The second or line polars of each point of the line envelope a conic, which is the lineo-polar envelope of the line.\n\nAnd reciprocally considering, in connexion with a curve of the third class, a line, we have—\n\n(e) The first or conic pole of the line.\n\n(f) The second or point pole of the line.\n\nAnd considering, in connexion with the curve of the third class, a point—\n\n(g) The first or conic poles of each line through the point touch four lines, which are the four polars of the point.\n\n(h) The second or point poles of each line through the point generate a conic, which is the point pole locus of the point.\n\nBut I shall not have occasion in the present memoir to speak of these reciprocal figures, except indeed the first or conic pole of the line.\n\nThe term conjugate poles of a cubic is used to denote two points, such that the first or conic polar of either of them, with respect to the cubic, is a pair of lines passing through the other of them. Reciprocally, the term conjugate polars of a curve of the third class denotes two lines, such that the first or conic pole of either of them, with respect to the curve of the third class, is a pair of points lying in the other of them.\n\nThe expression, a syzygetic cubic, used in reference to two cubics, denotes a curve of the third order passing through the points of intersection of the two cubics; but in the present memoir the expression is in general used in reference to a single cubic, to denote a curve of the third order passing through the points of intersection of the cubic and its Hessian. As regards curves of the third class, I use in the memoir the full expression, a curve of the third class syzygetically connected with two given curves of the third class.\n\nIt is a well-known theorem, that if at the points of intersection of a given line with a given cubic tangents are drawn to the cubic, these tangents again meet the cubic in three points which lie in a line; such line is in the present memoir termed the satellite line of the given line, and the point of intersection of the two lines is termed the satellite point of the given line; the given line in reference to its satellite line or point is termed the primary line.\n\nIn particular, if the primary line be a tangent of the cubic, the satellite line coincides with the primary line, and the satellite point is the point of simple intersection of the primary line and the cubic.\n\nArticle No. 2.—Group of Theorems relating to the Conjugate Poles of a Cubic.\n\n2. The theorems which I have first to mention relate to or originate out of the theory of the conjugate poles of a cubic, and may be conveniently connected together and explained by means of the accompanying figure.\nThe point E is a point of the Hessian; this being so, its first or conic polar, with respect to the cubic, will be a pair of lines passing through a point F of the Hessian; and not only so, but the first or conic polar of the point F, with respect to the cubic will be a pair of lines passing through E. The pair of lines through F are represented in the figure by FBA, FDC, and the pair of lines through E are represented by ECA, EDC, and the lines of the one pair meet the lines of the other pair in the points A, B, C, D. The point O, which is the intersection of the lines AD, BC, is a point of the Hessian, and joining EO, FO, these lines are tangents to the Hessian at the points E, F, that is, the points E, F are corresponding points of the Hessian, in the sense that the tangents to the Hessian at these points meet in a point of the Hessian. The two points E, F are, according to a preceding definition, conjugate poles of the cubic.\n\nThe line EF meets the Hessian in a third point G, and the points G, O are conjugate poles of the cubic. The first or conic polar of G, with respect to the cubic, is the pair of lines AOD, BOC meeting in O. The first or conic polar of O, with respect to the cubic, is the pair of lines GEF and $Gf'e'f'$ meeting in G. The four poles of the line EO, with respect to the cubic, are the points of intersection of the first or conic polars of the two points E and O, that is, the four poles in question are the points F, F, $e$, $e'$. Similarly, the four poles of the line FO, with respect to the cubic, are the points E, E, $f$, $f'$.\n\nThe line EF, that is, any line joining two conjugate poles of the cubic, is a tangent to the Pippian, and the point of contact $\\Gamma$ is the harmonic with respect to the points E, F (which are points on the Hessian) of G, the third point of intersection with the Hessian. Conversely, any tangent of the Pippian meets the Hessian in three points, two of which are conjugate poles of the cubic, and the point of contact is the harmonic, with respect to these two points, of the third point of intersection with the Hessian.\n\nThe line GO in the figure is of course also a tangent of the Pippian, and moreover the lines FBA, FDC (that is, the pair of lines which are the first or conic polar of E) and the lines ECA, EDB (that is, the pair of lines which are the first or conic polar of F) are also tangents to the Pippian. The point E represents any point of the Hessian, and the three tangents through E to the Pippian are the line EFG and the lines ECA, EDB; the line EFG is the line joining E with the conjugate pole F, and the lines ECA, EDB are the first or conic polar of this conjugate pole F with respect to the cubic. The figure shows that the line EO (the tangent to the Hessian at the point E) and the before-mentioned three lines (the tangents through E to the Pippian), are harmonically related, viz. the line EO the tangent of the Hessian, and the line EF one of the tangents to the Pippian, are harmonics with respect to the other two tangents to the Pippian. It is MDCCCLVII.\nobvious that the tangents to the Pippian through the point F are in like manner the line GFE, and the pair of lines FBA, FBC, and that these lines are harmonically related to FO the tangent at F of the Hessian. And similarly, the tangents to the Pippian through the point O are the line GO and the lines AOD, BOC, and the tangents to the Pippian through the point G are the line GO and the lines GFE and $Gf'ef'd$. Thus all the lines of the figure are tangents to the Pippian except the lines EO, FO, which are tangents to the Hessian. It may be added, that the lineo-polar envelope of the line EF with respect to the cubic is the pair of lines OE, OF.\n\nIt will be presently seen that the analytical theory leads to the consideration of a line IJ (not represented in the figure): the line in question is the polar of E (or F) with respect to the conic which is the first or conic polar of F (or E) with respect to any syzygetic cubic. The line IJ is a tangent of the Pippian, and moreover the lines EF and IJ are conjugate polars of a curve of the third class syzygetically connected with the Pippian and Quippian, and which is moreover such that its Hessian is the Pippian.\n\nArticle Nos. 3 to 19.—Analytical investigations, comprising the proof of the Theorems, Article No. 2.\n\n3. The analytical theory possesses considerable interest. Take as the equation of the cubic,\n\n$$U = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6lxyz = 0.$$  \n\nThen the equation of the Hessian is\n\n$$HU = l(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) - (1 + 2l^3)xyz = 0;$$\n\nand the equation of the Pippian in line coordinates (that is, the equation which expresses that $\\xi x + \\eta y + \\zeta z = 0$ is a tangent of the curve) is\n\n$$PU = -l(\\xi^3 + \\eta^3 + \\zeta^3) + (-1 + 4l^3)\\xi\\eta\\zeta = 0.$$  \n\nThe equation of the Quippian in line coordinates is\n\n$$QU = (1 - 10l^3)(\\xi^3 + \\eta^3 + \\zeta^3) - 6l^3(5 + 4l^3)\\xi\\eta\\zeta = 0;$$\n\nand the values of the two invariants of the cubic form are\n\n$$S = -l + l^4,$$\n\n$$T = 1 - 20l^3 - 8l^6,$$\n\nvalues which give identically,\n\n$$T^2 - 64S^3 = (1 + 8l^3)^3;$$\n\nthe last-mentioned function being in fact the discriminant.\n\n4. Suppose now that $(X, Y, Z)$ are the coordinates of the point E, and $(X', Y', Z')$ the coordinates of the point F; then the equations which express that these points are conjugate poles of the cubic, are\n\n$$XX' + l(YZ' + Y'Z) = 0,$$\n\n$$YY' + l(ZX' + Z'X) = 0,$$\n\n$$ZZ' + l(XY' + X'Y) = 0;$$\nand by eliminating from these equations, first \\((X', Y', Z')\\), and then \\((X, Y, Z)\\), we find\n\n\\[+l^3(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3) - (1 + 2l^3)XYZ = 0,\\]\n\n\\[+l^3(X'^3 + Y'^3 + Z'^3) - (1 + 2l^3)X'Y'Z' = 0,\\]\n\nwhich shows that the points \\(E, F\\) are each of them points of the Hessian.\n\n5. I may notice, in passing, that the preceding equations give rise to a somewhat singular unsymmetrical quadratic transformation of a cubic form. In fact, the second and third equations give \\(X': Y': Z' = YZ - l^3X^2: l^3XY - l^3Z^2: l^3ZX - l^3Y^2\\). And substituting these values for \\(X', Y', Z'\\) in the form\n\n\\[+l^3(X'^3 + Y'^3 + Z'^3) - (1 + 2l^3)X'Y'Z',\\]\n\nthe result must contain as a factor\n\n\\[+l^3(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3) - (1 + 2l^3)XYZ;\\]\n\nthe other factor is easily found to be\n\n\\[-l^3(l^3(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3) + 3l^3XYZ).\\]\n\nSeveral of the formulae given in the sequel conduct in like manner to unsymmetrical transformations of a cubic form.\n\n6. I remark also, that the last-mentioned system of equations gives, symmetrically,\n\n\\[X'^2: Y'^2: Z'^2: Y'Z': Z'X': X'Y'\\]\n\n\\[= YZ - l^3X^2: ZX - l^3Y^2: XY - l^3Z^2: l^3YZ - l^3X^2: l^3ZX - l^3Y^2: l^3XY - l^3Z^2;\\]\n\nand it is, I think, worth showing how, by means of these relations, we pass from the equation between \\(X', Y', Z'\\) to that between \\(X, Y, Z\\). In fact, representing, for shortness, the foregoing relations by\n\n\\[X'^2: Y'^2: Z'^2: Y'Z': Z'X': X'Y' = A: B: C: F: G: H,\\]\n\nwe may write\n\n\\[X' = AF = GH, \\quad Y' = BG = HF, \\quad Z' = CH = FG, \\quad ABC = FGH;\\]\n\nand thence\n\n\\[X'^3 = AF.G^2H^2, \\quad Y'^3 = BG.H^2F^2, \\quad Z'^3 = CH.F^2G^2, \\quad X'Y'Z' = F^2G^2H^2;\\]\n\nhence\n\n\\[+l^3(X'^3 + Y'^3 + Z'^3) - (1 + 2l^3)X'Y'Z'\\]\n\n\\[= FGH\\{+l^3(AGH + BHF + CFG) - (1 + 2l^3)FGH\\}.\\]\n\nBut we have\n\n\\[+l^3(AGH + BHF + CFG) = -(2l^3 + l^3)(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3)XYZ + (l^4 + 2l^7)(Y^3Z^3 + Z^3X^3 + X^3Y^3)\\]\n\n\\[-(1 + 2l^3)FGH = (l^3 + 2l^8)(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3)XYZ + (l^4 + 2l^7)(Y^3Z^3 + Z^3X^3 + X^3Y^3)\\]\n\n\\[+l^3(1 - l^3)(1 + 2l^3)X^2Y^2Z^2;\\]\n\nand thence\n\n\\[+l^3(AGH + BHF + CFG) - (1 + 2l^3)FGH\\]\n\n\\[= -l^3(1 - l^3)(l^3(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3)XYZ - (1 + 2l^3)X^2Y^2Z^2);\\]\n\nand finally,\n\n\\[+l^3(X'^3 + Y'^3 + Z'^3) - (1 + 2l^3)X'Y'Z'\\]\n\n\\[= l^3(-l + l^3)(lYZ - X^2)(lZX - Y^2)(lXY - Z^2)XYZ\\]\n\n\\[× \\{l^3(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3) - (1 + 2l^3)XYZ\\}. \\]\nWe have also, identically,\n\n\\[ ABC - FGH = \\frac{1}{l}(-l + l')XYZ\\{l^2(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3) - (1 + 2l^3)XYZ\\}, \\]\n\nwhich agrees with the relation \\( ABC - FGH = 0 \\).\n\n7. Before going further, it will be convenient to investigate certain relations which exist between the quantities \\((X, Y, Z), (X', Y', Z')\\), connected as before by the equations\n\n\\[ XX' + l(YZ' + Y'Z) = 0, \\]\n\\[ YY' + l(ZX' + Z'X) = 0, \\]\n\\[ ZZ' + l(XY' + X'Y) = 0, \\]\n\nand the quantities\n\n\\[ \\xi = YZ' - Y'Z, \\quad \\alpha = XX' = -\\frac{1}{l}(YZ' + Y'Z), \\]\n\\[ \\eta = ZX' - Z'X, \\quad \\beta = YY' = -\\frac{1}{l}(ZX' + Z'X), \\]\n\\[ \\zeta = XY' - X'Y, \\quad \\gamma = ZZ' = -\\frac{1}{l}(XY' + X'Y). \\]\n\nWe have identically,\n\n\\[ 2XX'(YZ' - Y'Z) + (XY' + X'Y)(ZX' - Z'X) + (ZX' + Z'X)(XY' - X'Y) = 0; \\]\n\nor expressing in terms of \\(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\) the quantities which enter into this equation, and forming the analogous equations, we have\n\n\\[ 2l\\alpha\\xi - \\gamma\\eta - \\beta\\zeta = 0 \\quad (\\text{A}) \\]\n\\[ -\\gamma\\xi + 2l\\beta\\eta - \\alpha\\zeta = 0 \\]\n\\[ -\\beta\\xi - \\alpha\\eta + 2l\\gamma\\zeta = 0. \\]\n\nWe have also\n\n\\[ X^2Y'Z' - X'^2YZ = \\frac{1}{2}\\{-(XY' + X'Y)(ZX' - Z'X) + (ZX' + Z'X)(XY' - X'Y)\\}, \\]\n\nand thence in like manner,\n\n\\[ X^2Y'Z' - X'^2YZ = \\frac{1}{2l}(\\gamma\\eta - \\beta\\zeta) \\quad (\\text{B}) \\]\n\\[ Y^2Z'X' - Y'^2ZX = \\frac{1}{2l}(\\alpha\\zeta - \\gamma\\xi) \\]\n\\[ Z^2X'Y' - Z'^2YZ = \\frac{1}{2l}(\\beta\\xi - \\alpha\\eta). \\]\n\nAgain, we have\n\n\\[ (YZ' - Y'Z)^2 = (YZ' + Y'Z)^2 - 4YY'ZZ' \\]\n\\[ (ZX' - Z'X)(XY' - X'Y) = -(ZX' + Z'X)(XY' + X'Y) + 2XX'(YZ' + Y'Z); \\]\n\nand thence\n\n\\[ \\xi^2 = \\frac{1}{l^2}\\alpha^2 - 4\\beta\\gamma \\quad (\\text{C}) \\]\n\\[ \\eta^2 = \\frac{1}{l^2}\\beta^2 - 4\\gamma\\alpha \\]\n\\[ \\zeta^2 = \\frac{1}{l^2}\\gamma^2 - 4\\alpha\\beta \\]\n\\[ \\eta = -\\frac{2}{l} \\alpha^2 - \\frac{1}{l} \\beta \\gamma \\]\n\\[ \\zeta = -\\frac{2}{l} \\beta^2 - \\frac{1}{l} \\gamma \\alpha \\]\n\\[ \\xi = -\\frac{2}{l} \\gamma^2 - \\frac{1}{l} \\alpha \\beta; \\]\n\nand conversely,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{l}(1+8l^3)\\alpha^2 = \\xi^2 - 4l^3 \\eta \\zeta \\quad (D) \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{l}(1+8l^3)\\beta^2 = \\eta^2 - 4l^3 \\xi \\zeta \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{l}(1+8l^3)\\gamma^2 = \\zeta^2 - 4l^3 \\xi \\eta \\]\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{l}(1+8l^3)\\beta \\gamma = 2l \\xi^2 + \\eta \\zeta \\]\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{l}(1+8l^3)\\gamma \\alpha = 2l \\eta^2 + \\xi \\zeta \\]\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{l}(1+8l^3)\\alpha \\beta = 2l \\zeta^2 + \\xi \\eta. \\]\n\n8. It is obvious that\n\n\\[ \\xi x + \\eta y + \\zeta z = 0 \\]\n\nis the equation of the line EF joining the two conjugate poles, and it may be shown that\n\n\\[ \\alpha x + \\beta y + \\gamma z = 0 \\]\n\nis the equation of the line IJ, which is the polar of E with respect to a conic which is the first or conic polar of F with respect to any syzygetic cubic. In fact, the equation of a syzygetic cubic will be \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6\\lambda xyz = 0 \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is arbitrary, and the equation of the line in question is\n\n\\[ (X \\partial_x + Y \\partial_y + Z \\partial_z)(X' \\partial_x + Y' \\partial_y + Z' \\partial_z)(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6\\lambda xyz) = 0; \\]\n\nor developing,\n\n\\[ XX'x + YY'y + ZZ'z \\]\n\\[ + \\lambda \\{(YZ' + Y'Z)x + (ZX' + Z'X)y + (XY' + X'Y)z\\} = 0; \\]\n\nand the function on the left-hand side is\n\n\\[ \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{l}\\right)(\\alpha x + \\beta y + \\gamma z), \\]\n\nwhich proves the theorem.\n\n9. The equations (A) by the elimination of (\\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta \\)), give\n\n\\[ -l(\\alpha^3 + \\beta^3 + \\gamma^3) + (-1 + 4l^3)\\alpha \\beta \\gamma = 0, \\]\n\nwhich shows that the line IJ is a tangent of the Pippian: the proof of the theorem is given in this place because the relation just obtained between \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\) is required for the proof of some of the other theorems.\n10. To find the coordinates of the point G in which the line EF joining two conjugate poles again meets the Hessian.\n\nWe may take for the coordinates of G,\n\n\\[ uX + vX', \\quad uY + vY', \\quad uZ + vZ' ; \\]\n\nand substituting in the equation of the Hessian the terms containing \\( u^3, v^3 \\) disappear, and the ratio \\( u : v \\) is determined by a simple equation. It thus appears that we may write\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nu &= -3l^2(XX'^2 + YY'^2 + ZZ'^2) + (1 + 2l^3)(YZ'X + Z'X'Y + X'Y'Z) \\\\\nv &= 3l^2(X^2X' + Y^2Y' + Z^2Z') - (1 + 2l^3)(YZX' + ZXY' + XYZ') ;\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nhence introducing, as before, the quantities \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\), we find\n\n\\[ uX + vX' = 3l^2(\\gamma\\eta - \\beta\\zeta) + (1 + 2l^3)(X^2Y'Z' - X'YZ) ; \\]\n\nbut from the first of the equations (B),\n\n\\[ X^2Y'Z' - X'YZ = \\frac{1}{2l}(\\gamma\\eta - \\beta\\zeta), \\]\n\nand therefore the preceding value of \\( uX + vX' \\) becomes\n\n\\[ \\left( 3l^2 - \\frac{1 + 2l^3}{2l} \\right)(\\gamma\\eta - \\beta\\zeta), \\]\n\nwhich is equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1 + 4l^3}{2l}(\\gamma\\eta - \\beta\\zeta). \\]\n\nHence throwing out the constant factor, we find, for the coordinates of the point G, the values\n\n\\[ \\gamma\\eta - \\beta\\zeta, \\quad \\alpha\\zeta - \\gamma\\xi, \\quad \\beta\\xi - \\alpha\\eta. \\]\n\n11. To find the coordinates of the point O.\n\nConsider O as the point of intersection of the tangents to the Hessian at the points E, F, then the coordinates of O are proportional to the terms of\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n3l^2X^2 - 1 + 2l^3YZ, & 3l^2Y^2 - 1 + 2l^3ZX, & 3l^2Z^2 - 1 + 2l^3XY \\\\\n3l^2X'^2 - 1 + 2l^3YY', & 3l^2Y'^2 - 1 + 2l^3ZX', & 3l^2Z'^2 - 1 + 2l^3XY'.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHence the x-coordinate is proportional to\n\n\\[ (3l^2Y^2 - 1 + 2l^3ZX)(3l^2Z'^2 - 1 + 2l^3X'Y') - (3l^2Z^2 - 1 + 2l^3XY)3l^2Y'^2 - 1 + 2l^3Z'X'), \\]\n\nwhich is equal to\n\n\\[ 9l^4(Y^2Z'^2 - Y'^2Z^2) + 3l^2(1 + 2l^3)YY'(XY' - X'Y) + 3l^2(1 + 2l^3)ZZ'(ZX' - Z'X) \\]\n\\[ -(1 + 2l^3)^2XX'(YZ' - Y'Z); \\]\n\nor introducing, as before, the quantities \\( \\xi, \\eta, \\zeta, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\), to\n\n\\[ -9l^4\\alpha\\xi + 3l^2(1 + 2l^3)(\\beta\\zeta + \\gamma\\eta) - (1 + 2l^3)^2\\alpha\\xi \\]\n\\[ = (-1 - 13l^3 - 4l^5)\\alpha\\xi + 2l^2(1 + 2l^3)(\\beta\\zeta + \\gamma\\eta). \\]\nBut by the first of the equations (A) \\( \\beta \\xi + \\gamma \\eta = 2l \\alpha \\xi \\), and the preceding value thus becomes \\((-1 - 7l^3 + 8l^6)\\alpha \\xi\\).

But if the syzygetic cubic $\\alpha U + 6\\beta HU = 0$ be properly selected, viz. if this curve be such that its Hessian breaks up into three lines, then both the Pippian of the cubic $\\alpha U + 6\\beta HU = 0$, and the Pippian of its Hessian will break up into the same three points, which will be a portion of the curve of the sixth class, and discarding these three points the curve will sink down to one on the third class, and will in fact be the Quippian of the cubic.\nTo show this we may take\n\n\\[ \\alpha U + 6\\beta HU = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 \\]\n\nas the equation of the syzygetic cubic satisfying the prescribed condition, for this value in fact gives\n\n\\[ H(\\alpha U + 6\\beta HU) = -xyz = 0, \\]\n\na system of three lines.

The envelope of a line which meets three given conics, the first or conic polars of any three points with respect to the cubic, in six points in involution, is the Pippian.\n\nIt is readily seen that if the theorem is true with respect to the three conics,\n\n\\[ \\frac{dU}{dx} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dU}{dy} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dU}{dz} = 0, \\]\n\nit is true with respect to any three conics whatever of the form\n\n\\[ \\lambda \\frac{dU}{dx} + \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy} + \\nu \\frac{dU}{dz} = 0, \\]\nthat is, with respect to any three conics, each of them the first or conic polar of some point \\((\\lambda, \\mu, \\nu)\\) with respect to the cubic. Considering then these three conics, take as the equation of the line \\(\\xi x + \\eta y + \\zeta z = 0\\), and let \\((X, Y, Z)\\) be the coordinates of a point of intersection with the first conic, we have\n\n\\[\n\\xi X + \\eta Y + \\zeta Z = 0,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nX^2 + 2lYZ = 0;\n\\]\n\nand combining with these a linear equation\n\n\\[\n\\alpha X + \\beta Y + \\gamma Z = 0,\n\\]\n\nin which \\((\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)\\) are arbitrary quantities, we have\n\n\\[\nX : Y : Z = \\gamma \\eta - \\beta \\zeta : \\alpha \\zeta - \\gamma \\xi : \\beta \\xi - \\alpha \\eta;\n\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\n(\\gamma \\eta - \\beta \\zeta)^2 + 2l(\\alpha \\zeta - \\gamma \\xi)(\\beta \\xi - \\alpha \\eta) = 0,\n\\]\n\nan equation in \\((\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)\\) which is in fact the equation in line coordinates of the two points of intersection with the first conic.

The theorem applies therefore to any three conics whatever, but in this case the cubic curve is not given, and the Pippian therefore stands merely for a curve of the third class, and the theorem is as follows, viz. the envelope of a line which meets any three conics in six points in involution, is a curve of the third class.\nArticle No. 23.—Completion of the theory in Liouville, and comparison with analogous theorems of Hesse.\n\nIn order to convert the foregoing theorem into its reciprocal, we must replace the cubic \\( U = 0 \\) by a curve of the third class, that is we must consider the coordinates which enter into the equation as line coordinates; and it of course follows that the coordinates which enter into the equation \\( PU = 0 \\) must be considered as point coordinates, that is we must consider the Pippian as a curve of the third order: we have thus the theorem; The locus of a point such that the tangents drawn from it to three given conics (the first or conic poles of any three lines with respect to a curve of the third class) form a pencil in involution, is the Pippian considered as a curve of the third order. This in fact completes the fundamental theorem in my memoirs in Liouville above referred to, and establishes the analogy with Hesse’s results in relation to the Hessian; to show this I set out the two series of theorems as follows:\n\nHesse, in his memoirs “On Curves of the Third Order and Curves of the Third Class,” Orelle, tt. xxviii. xxxvi. and xxxviii., has shown as follows:\n\n(a) The locus of a point such that its polars, with respect to the three conics \\( X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0 \\) (or more generally its polars with respect to all the conics of the series \\( \\lambda X + \\mu Y + \\nu Z = 0 \\)) meet in a point, is a curve of the third order \\( V = 0 \\).\n\n(b) Conversely, given a curve of the third order \\( V = 0 \\), there exists a series of conics such that the polars with respect to all the conics of any point whatever of the curve \\( V = 0 \\), meet in a point.\n\n(c) The equation of any one of the conics in question is\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\frac{dU}{dx} + \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy} + \\nu \\frac{dU}{dz} = 0,\n\\]\n\nthat is, the conic is the first or conic polar of a point \\((\\lambda, \\mu, \\nu)\\) with respect to a certain curve of the third order \\( U = 0 \\); and this curve is determined by the condition that its Hessian is the given curve \\( V = 0 \\), that is, we have \\( V = HU \\).\n\n(d) The equation \\( V = HU \\) is solved by assuming \\( U = aV + bHV \\), for we have then \\( H(aV + bHV) = AV + BHV \\), where \\( A, B \\) are given cubic functions of \\( a, b \\), and thence \\( V = HU = AV + BHV \\), or \\( A = 1, B = 0 \\); the latter equation gives what is alone important, the ratio \\( a : b \\), and it thus appears that there are three distinct series of conics, each of them having the above-mentioned relation to the given curve of the third order \\( V = 0 \\).\n\nIn the memoirs in Liouville above referred to, I have in effect shown that—\n\n(a') The locus of a point such that the tangents from it to three conics, represented in line coordinates by the equations \\( X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0 \\) (or more generally with respect to any three conics of the series \\( \\lambda X + \\mu Y + \\nu Z = 0 \\)) form a pencil in involution, is a curve of the third order \\( V = 0 \\).\n\n(b') Conversely, given a curve of the third order \\( V = 0 \\), there exists a series of conics such that the tangents from any point whatever of the curve to any three of the conics, form a pencil in involution.\nNow, considering the coordinates which enter into the equation of the Pippian as point coordinates, and consequently the Pippian as a curve of the third order, I am able to add as follows:\n\n(γ') The equation in line coordinates of any one of the conics in question is\n\n\\[ \\lambda \\frac{dU}{d\\xi} + \\mu \\frac{dU}{d\\eta} + \\nu \\frac{dU}{d\\zeta} = 0, \\]\n\nthat is, the conic is the first or conic polar of a line \\((\\lambda, \\mu, \\nu)\\) with respect to a certain curve of the third class \\(U=0\\); and this curve is determined by the condition that its Pippian is the given curve of the third order \\(V=0\\), that is, we have \\(V=PU\\).\n\n(δ) The equation \\(V=PU\\) is solved by assuming \\(U=aPV+bQV\\), for we have then \\(P(aPV+bQV)=AV+BHV\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are given cubic functions of \\(a, b\\); and thence \\(V=PU=AV+BHV\\), or \\(A=1, B=0\\); the latter equation gives what is alone important, the ratio \\(a:b\\); and it thus appears that there are three distinct curves of the third class \\(U=0\\), and therefore (what indeed is shown in the Memoirs in Liouville) three distinct series of conics having the above-mentioned relation to the given curve of the third order \\(V=0\\).\n\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that the preceding theorems, although precisely analogous to those of Hesse, are entirely distinct theorems, that is the two series are not connected together by any relation of reciprocity.\n\nArticle Nos. 24 to 28.—Various investigations and theorems.\n\n24. Reverting to the theorem (No. 18), that the lineo-polar envelope of the line \\(EF\\) is the pair of lines \\(OE, OF\\); the line \\(EF\\) is any tangent of the Pippian, hence the theorem includes the following one:\n\nThe lineo-polar envelope with respect to the cubic, of any tangent of the Pippian, is a pair of lines.\n\nAnd conversely,\n\nThe Pippian is the envelope of a line such that the lineo-polar envelope of the line with respect to the cubic is a pair of lines.\n\nIt is I think worth while to give an independent proof.

The equation \\(\\Theta = 0\\) is that of a conic, viz. the first or conic polar of \\(S\\) with respect to a certain syzygetic cubic\n\n\\[ -2(\\alpha YZ + \\beta ZX + \\gamma XY)(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) + (\\alpha X^2 + \\beta Y^2 + \\gamma Z^2)xyz = 0, \\]\ndepending on the points Σ, Ω, or, what is the same thing, the conic Θ = 0 is a properly selected conic passing through the points of intersection of the first or conic polars of Σ with respect to any two syzygetic cubics; and lastly, K is a constant coefficient.\n\nThe equation expresses that the points of intersection of\n\n(W = 0, P = 0), (W = 0, Θ = 0), (L = 0, P = 0), (L = 0, Θ = 0),\n\nlie in the syzygetic cubic Υ = 0.\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation may be written\n\n\\[-XYZ \\{α(X^2 + 2lYZ) + β(Y^2 + 2lZX) + γ(Z^2 + 2lXY)\\}(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6lxyz)\\]\n\n\\[+ xyz \\{α(X^2 + 2lYZ) + β(Y^2 + 2lZX) + γ(Z^2 + 2lXY)\\}(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + 6lXYZ);\\]\n\nand it may be remarked also that we have\n\n\\[-3XYZ \\{α(X^2 + 2lYZ) + β(Y^2 + 2lZX) + γ(Z^2 + 2lXY)\\}\\]\n\nequal identically to\n\n\\[X(Y^3 - Z^3)(γY - βZ) + Y(Z^3 - X^3)(αZ - γX) + Z(X^3 - Y^3)(βX - αY)\\]\n\n\\[-(αYZ + βZX + γXY)(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + 6lXYZ).\\]\n\nHence if we assume\n\n\\[X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + 6lXYZ = 0,\\]\n\nthe equation will take the form\n\n\\[KU = WL + PΘ,\\]\n\nwhere the constant coefficient K may be expressed under the two different forms\n\n\\[K = -XYZ \\{α(X^2 + 2lYZ) + β(Y^2 + 2lZX) + γ(Z^2 + 2lXY)\\}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{3} \\{X(Y^3 - Z^3)(γY - βZ) + Y(Z^3 - X^3)(αZ - γX) + Z(X^3 - Y^3)(βX - αY)\\},\\]\n\nand W, L, P, Θ have the same values as before. In the present case the point Σ is a point of the cubic: the equation W = 0 represents the first or conic polar of the point in question, and the equation P = 0 its second or line polar, which is also the tangent of the cubic. The line L = 0 is a line joining the point Ω with the satellite point of the tangent at Σ, or dropping altogether the consideration of the point Ω, is an arbitrary line through the satellite point: the first or conic polar of Σ meets the cubic twice in the point Σ, and therefore also meets it in four other points; the conic Θ = 0 is a conic passing through these four points, and completely determined when the particular position of the line through the satellite point is given. And, as before remarked, Θ = 0 is a conic passing through the points of intersection of the first or conic polars of Σ with respect to any two syzygetic cubics. We have thus the theorem,—\n\nThe first or conic polar of a point of the cubic touches the cubic at this point, and besides meets it in four other points; the four points in question are the points in which the first or conic polar of the given point in respect of the cubic is intersected by the first or conic polar of the same point in respect to any syzygetic cubic whatever,\n\n38. The analytical result may be thus stated: putting\n\n\\[z = αYZ + βZX + γXY, λ = αX^2 + βY^2 + γZ^2,\\]\nor, if we please, considering \\( x, \\lambda \\) as arbitrary parameters, then the four points lie in the conic\n\n\\[\n(2xX, 2xY, 2xZ, -\\lambda X, -\\lambda Y, -\\lambda Z)(x, y, z)^2 = 0,\n\\]\n\nor, what is the same thing, they are the points of intersection of the two conics\n\n\\[\nXx^2 + Yy^2 + Zz^2 = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\nXyz + Yzx + Zxy = 0.\n\\]\n\n39. Considering the four points as the angles of a quadrangle, it may be shown that the three centres of the quadrangle lie on the cubic. To effect this, assume that the conic\n\n\\[\n(2xX, 2xY, 2xZ, -\\lambda X, -\\lambda Y, -\\lambda Z)(x, y, z)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nrepresents a pair of lines; these lines will intersect in a point, which is one of the three centres in question. And taking \\( x, y, z \\) as the coordinates of this point, we have\n\n\\[\nx^2 : y^2 : z^2 : yz : zx : xy = 4x^2YZ - \\lambda^2X^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: 4x^2ZX - \\lambda^2Y^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: 4x^2XY - \\lambda^2Z^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: \\lambda^2YZ + 2x\\lambda X^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: \\lambda^2ZX + 2x\\lambda Y^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: \\lambda^2XY + 2x\\lambda Z^2;\n\\]\n\nand we may, if we please, use these equations to find the relation between \\( x, \\lambda \\). Thus in the identical equation \\( x^2.y^2 - (xy)^2 = 0 \\), substituting for \\( x^2, xy, y^2 \\) their values, and throwing out the factor \\( Z \\), we find \\((4x^3 - \\lambda^3)XYZ - z\\lambda^2(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3) = 0 \\), and thence, in virtue of the equation \\( X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + 6lXYZ = 0 \\), we obtain\n\n\\[\n4x^3 + 6l\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^3 = 0.\n\\]\n\nBut the preceding system gives conversely,\n\n\\[\nX^2 : Y^2 : Z^2 : YZ : ZX : XY = 4x^2yz - \\lambda^2x^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: 4x^2zx - \\lambda^2y^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: 4x^2xy - \\lambda^2z^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: \\lambda^2yz + 2x\\lambda x^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: \\lambda^2zx + 2x\\lambda y^2\n\\]\n\\[\n: \\lambda^2xy + 2x\\lambda z^2.\n\\]\n\nHence from the identical relation \\( X^2.Y^2 - (XY)^2 = 0 \\), substituting for \\( X^2, XY, Y^2 \\) their values, and throwing out the factor \\( z \\), we find \\((4x^3 - \\lambda^3)xyz - z\\lambda^2(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) = 0 \\), and thence, in virtue of the equation \\( 4x^3 - \\lambda^3 = -6l\\lambda^2 \\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6lxyz = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich shows that the point in question lies on the cubic. We have thus the theorem,— The first or conic polar of a point of the cubic touches the cubic at the point, and\nmeets it besides in four points, which are the angles of a quadrangle the centres of which lie on the cubic. In other words, the quadrangle is an inscribed quadrangle.\n\n40. To find the equations of the axes of the quadrangle, that is of the lines through two centres.\n\nWe have\n\n\\[\n(4x^3YZ - \\lambda^2X^3)x + (\\lambda^2XY + 2\\kappa\\lambda Z^2)y + (\\lambda^2ZX + 2\\kappa\\lambda Y^2)z = 0 \\\\\n(\\lambda^2XY + 2\\kappa\\lambda Z^2)x + (4x^2ZX - \\lambda^2Y^2)y + (\\lambda^2YZ + 2\\kappa\\lambda X^2)z = 0 \\\\\n(\\lambda^2ZX + 2\\kappa\\lambda Y^2)x + (\\lambda^2YZ + 2\\kappa\\lambda X^2)y + (4x^2XY - \\lambda^2Z^2)z = 0;\n\\]\n\nor arranging these equations in the proper form and eliminating \\(x^2, \\kappa\\lambda, \\lambda^2\\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nYZx, & Z^2y + Y^2z, & X(-Xx + Yy + Zz) \\\\\nZXy, & X^2z + Z^2x, & Y(Xx - Yy + Zz) \\\\\nXYz, & Y^2x + X^2y, & Z(Xx + Yy - Zz)\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0;\n\\]\n\nor multiplying out,\n\n\\[\nXYZ\\{(Z^3 - Y^3)x^3 + (X^3 - Z^3)y^3 + (Y^3 - X^3)z^3\\} \\\\\n+ x^2yZY^2(-2X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3) + zx^2YZ^2(2X^3 - Y^3 - Z^3) \\\\\n+ y^2zXZ^2(-2Y^3 + Z^3 + X^3) + xy^2ZX^2(2Y^3 - Z^3 - X^3) \\\\\n+ z^2xYX^2(-2Z^3 + X^3 + Y^3) + yz^2XY^2(2Z^3 - X^3 - Y^3) = 0.\n\\]\n\nWe may simplify this result by means of the equation \\(X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + 6lXYZ = 0\\), so as to make the left-hand side divide out by XYZ: we thus obtain\n\n\\[\n(Z^3 - Y^3)x^3 + (X^3 - Z^3)y^3 + (Y^3 - X^3)z^3 \\\\\n+ (-3X^2Y - 6lY^2Z)x^2y + (-3Y^2Z - 6lZ^2X)y^2z + (-3Z^2X - 6lX^2Y)z^2x \\\\\n+ (3XY^2 + 6lX^2Z)xy^2 + (3YZ^2 + 6lY^2X)yz^2 + (3ZX^2 + 6lZ^2Y)zx^2 = 0;\n\\]\n\nor in a different form,\n\n\\[\n(y^3 - z^3)X^3 + (z^3 - x^3)Y^3 + (x^3 - y^3)Z^3 \\\\\n+ (-3x^2y - 6lz^2x)X^2Y + (-3y^2z - 6lx^2y)Y^2Z + (-3z^2x - 6ly^2z)Z^2X \\\\\n+ (3xy^2 + 6lyz^2)XY^2 + (3yz^2 + 6lxz^2)YZ^2 + (3zx^2 + 6lxy^2)ZX^2 = 0,\n\\]\n\nas the equation of the three axes of the quadrangle.\n\nArticle No. 41.—Recapitulation of geometrical definitions of the Pippian.\n\nIn conclusion, I will recapitulate the different modes of generation or geometrical definitions of the Pippian, obtained in the course of the present memoir. The curve in question is—\n\n1. The envelope of the line joining a pair of conjugate poles of the cubic (see Nos. 2 and 13).\n\n2.

The envelope of a line which is the polar of a conjugate pole of the cubic, with respect to the conic which is the first or conic polar of the other conjugate pole in respect to any syzygetic cubic (see Nos. 2 and 9).\n\n4. The locus of the harmonic with respect to a pair of conjugate poles of the cubic of the third point of intersection with the Hessian of the line joining the two conjugate poles (see Nos. 2 and 17).\n\n5. The envelope of a line such that its lineo-polar envelope with respect to the cubic breaks up into a pair of lines (see No. 24).\n\n6. The envelope of a line which meets three conics, the first or conic polars of any three points in respect to the cubic, in six points in involution (see No. 22).\n\n7. The envelope of the second or line polar with respect to the cubic, of a point the locus of which is a certain curve of the sixth order in quadratic syzygy with the cubic and Hessian, viz. the curve $-S.U^2+(HU)^2=0$ (see No. 27).\n\n8. The envelope of a line having for its satellite point a point of the Hessian (see No. 35).\n\n9. The envelope of the polar of the satellite point with respect to the Hessian of the tangent at a point of the Hessian, with respect to the first or conic polar of the point of the Hessian in respect to the cubic (see No. 36).",
