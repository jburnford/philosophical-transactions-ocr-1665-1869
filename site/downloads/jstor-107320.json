S.\n\nRead March 19, 1812.\n\nMathematicians, in treating of the attraction of bodies, have confined their attention, almost entirely, to those solids which are bounded by continuous curve surfaces; and Mr. Playfair, if I do not mistake, is the only writer, who has given any example of that kind of inquiry, which is the chief object of the present paper. This learned mathematician has found expressions* for the action of a parallelopiped; and of an isosceles pyramid, with a rectangular base, on a point at its vertex; and observes, on occasion of the first mentioned problem, that what he has there done, \"gives some hopes of being able to determine generally the attraction of solids bounded by any planes whatever.\"\n\nIt is this general problem, that I venture to attempt the solution of, in what follows: viz. any solid, regular or irregular, terminated by plane surfaces, being given, to find, both in quantity and direction, its action, on a point, given in position, either within or without it.\n\n* Ed. Trans. Vol. VI. p. 228 to 243. It is proper however to observe, that Mr. Playfair's expression, at p. 242, for the action of a parallelopiped, requires to have its sign changed; being, as it stands at present, negative, from the manner of correcting the fluent.\nNor has the matter any difficulty, as far as theory* only is concerned; although, actually to find the attraction, of a body of very complicated figure, may, no doubt, be exceedingly laborious and troublesome: for no one, I suppose, will conceive, that it can be done in any other manner, than by a previous partition into more simple forms, each of which must have its action found separately.\n\nHaving completed this part of my subject in the three first sections, I next apply the formulas, given in §. 1, to find the attraction of certain complex bodies, which, though not bounded by planes, have yet a natural connexion with the preceding part of the paper. Finally, the fifth section treats, pretty fully, of solids of greatest attraction, under various circumstances; and I do not know, that any one of the problems there given has been before considered by mathematicians; whilst, on the other hand, the results of former writers are easily derived as corollaries.\n\nFor the sake of perspicuity, I have divided the paper into propositions, and shall terminate this short introduction by expressing a hope, that I may not be chargeable with unnecessary prolixity.\n\n§. 1.\n\nOf the Attraction of Planes bounded by right Lines.\n\nAs all such figures may be divided into triangles, it seems natural to begin with these.\n\n* It is usual, I think, with mathematicians, to consider a thing as done, when it can be pointed out how it may be done. Thus M. Lagrange, in his excellent work \"De la Résolution des Equations numériques,\" says (p. 43) \"cette méthode ne laisse, \"ce me semble, rien à désirer.\" where, of course, he can only mean, as far as relates to theory.\nProp. 1.\n\nLet rvm, fig. 1, be a triangle, right angled at r, and pm a right line, perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, at the angular point m; it is required to find the attraction of the triangle, on the point p, both in quantity and direction.\n\nConceive a plane to pass through the point p, parallel to the plane of the triangle, and, in it, the lines pg, po, respectively parallel to rm, rv. The problem will be solved, if we find the actions of the triangle, in the directions of the three rectangular co-ordinates pm, pg, po.\n\nDraw ks parallel to rv, and put $a = pm$, $b = rm$, $T = mk$, $t = kq$; then $pq = \\sqrt{a^2 + T^2 + t^2}$. Let $r = \\text{tang. vmr}$, then $ks = r \\times km$.\n\nThe element of the plane at q is $\\dot{T} \\times \\dot{t}$, and its action, on p, in the direction pq, is $\\frac{\\dot{T} \\dot{t}}{a^2 + T^2 + t^2}$; by resolving which, and putting A, B, C for the actions of the triangle, in the directions pm, pg, po, we get\n\n$$A = \\int \\int \\frac{a \\dot{T} \\dot{t}}{(a^2 + T^2 + t^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}; \\quad B = \\int \\int \\frac{T \\dot{T} \\dot{t}}{(a^2 + T^2 + t^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}; \\quad C = \\int \\int \\frac{\\dot{T} \\dot{t} \\dot{t}}{(a^2 + T^2 + t^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$$\n\nin all which expressions, we must first take the fluent, with respect to $t$, from $t = o$, to $t = rT$; and afterwards, with respect to $T$, from $T = o$, to $T = b$. To begin with A,— a first operation gives\n\n$$A = \\int \\frac{arT \\dot{T}}{(a^2 + T^2)(a^2 + (1 + r^2)T^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$$\n\nwhich, if we put $\\beta^2 = 1 + r^2$, will be changed to\n\n$$A = \\int \\frac{arT \\dot{T}}{\\beta(a^2 + T^2)\\left(\\frac{a^2}{\\beta^2} + T^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}.$$\nPut \\( z^2 = \\frac{a^2}{\\beta^2} + T^2 \\), whence \\( T^2 = z^2 - \\frac{a^2}{\\beta^2} \\), \\( TT = z \\dot{z} \\): by substituting these values we get\n\n\\[ A = \\int \\frac{ar \\dot{z}}{\\beta \\left( a^2 - \\frac{a^2}{\\beta^2} - a^2 + z^2 \\right)} = (\\text{because } \\beta^2 - 1 = r) \\int \\frac{ar \\dot{z}}{\\beta \\left( \\frac{a^2}{\\beta^2} r^2 + z^2 \\right)}, \\]\n\nwhich, if we multiply both numerator and denominator by \\( \\frac{\\beta^2}{a^2 r^2} \\), becomes \\( \\int \\frac{\\beta ar \\dot{z}}{1 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{a^2 r^2} z^2} = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{\\beta}{ar} z \\text{)}, \\) and, by putting for \\( z \\) and \\( \\beta \\) their values, we have at last\n\n\\[ *A = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1+r^2}{a^2} b^2} \\text{)} - \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\text{)}. \\]\n\nIn like manner, a first integration of \\( B \\) gives\n\n\\[ B = \\int \\frac{r T^2 \\dot{T}}{(a^2 + T^2)(a^2 + (1+r^2) T^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\int \\frac{r T^2 \\dot{T}}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}(a^2 + T^2)\\left(\\frac{a^2}{1+r^2} + T^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} \\int \\left\\{ \\frac{\\dot{T}}{\\left(\\frac{a^2}{1+r^2} + T^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\frac{a^2 \\dot{T}}{(a^2 + T^2)\\left(\\frac{a^2}{1+r^2} + T^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nPut \\( T = a \\text{ tang. } \\varpi \\), then \\( \\dot{T} = a \\text{ sect. } \\varpi \\dot{\\varpi}, a^2 + T^2 = a^2 \\text{ sect. } \\varpi; \\) by this means the last term under the sign of the fluent is changed to \\( \\frac{\\dot{\\varpi}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{1+r^2} + \\text{tang. } \\varpi^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} = - \\frac{\\sqrt{1+r^2}}{r} \\times \\frac{r \\sin \\varpi}{(1+r^2 \\sin \\varpi^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}; \\)\n\nwherefore, observing that \\( \\text{tang. } \\varpi = \\frac{T}{a} \\), and consequently \\( \\sin \\varpi = \\frac{T}{\\sqrt{a^2 + T^2}}, \\) we find at last\n\n\\[ * \\text{This quantity can be put under another form, which may be better in some cases.} \\]\n\nIf we denote by \\( b' \\) the side \\( rv \\) of the triangle, \\( r = \\frac{b'}{b} \\), and\n\n\\[ A = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{b}{b'} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b'^2 + b^2}}{a} \\text{)} - \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{b}{b'} \\text{)}. \\]\nas are terminated by Planes, &c.\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} L \\left( \\frac{b}{a} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1+r^2} + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}} \\right) - L \\left\\{ \\frac{rb}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{r^2b^2}{a^2+b^2}} \\right\\} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} L \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}}. \\]\n\nWe have yet to find the value of C; and at first we get\n\n\\[ C = \\int \\frac{\\dot{T}}{(a^2+T^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\int \\frac{\\dot{T}}{(a^2+(1+r)T^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\int \\frac{\\dot{T}}{\\left(1+\\frac{T^2}{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\frac{\\dot{T}}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{\\dot{T}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{1+r^2} + \\frac{T^2}{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}},} \\]\n\nwhich again integrated, becomes\n\n\\[ C = L \\left( \\frac{b}{a} + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} L \\left( \\frac{b}{a} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1+r^2} + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} L \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}}. \\]\n\nThe expressions we have thus arrived at, for the action of a right angled triangle, are of such continual use in the following propositions, that it will be convenient to represent them by some concise symbol; and as they are functions of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(r\\) we may put\n\n\\[ A = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1+r^2}{a^2} b^2}) - \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r}) = \\phi(a, b, r) - \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r}). \\]\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} L \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1+r^2} b}{a} + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1+r^2}{a^2} b^2} \\right) - L \\left( \\frac{rb+\\sqrt{a^2+(1+r^2)b^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\chi(a, b, r). \\]\n\n\\[ C = L \\left( \\frac{b}{a} + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}} \\right) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} L \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1+r^2} b}{a} + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1+r^2}{a^2} b^2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\psi(a, b, r). \\]\n\nCor. 1. If, whilst \\(r\\) remains constant, \\(b\\) and \\(a\\) are supposed to vary, but so as to preserve the same ratio to each other, the\npartial forces A, B, C will remain unchanged, as, consequently, will the total force, both in quantity and direction.\n\nFor, if we put \\( m \\times a \\) for \\( b \\), the expressions of the forces become \\( \\phi(1, m, r) = \\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r}) \\), \\( \\chi(1, m, r) \\), \\( \\psi(1, m, r) \\); which are independent of the absolute values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). It is scarcely necessary to observe, that \\( \\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r}) \\) is the arc, to the radius unity, corresponding to the angle \\( rvn \\).\n\nCor. 2. When \\( r \\) becomes infinite, the triangle \\( rvn \\) is changed into a parallelogram, infinitely extended in the direction \\( rv \\); in which case, the expressions of the forces become very simple, viz. \\( A = \\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{b}{a}) \\), \\( B = L \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} \\), \\( C = L \\cdot \\frac{b + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} \\).\n\nProp. 2.\n\nLet \\( vmu \\), fig. 2, be any triangle whatever, \\( pm \\) a line perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, at the angular point \\( m \\): from whence, let fall the perpendicular \\( mr \\) on the opposite side \\( uv \\); moreover, let \\( pg \\), \\( po \\), be respectively parallel to \\( mr \\), \\( vu \\).\n\nIt is required to find the actions of the triangle \\( vmu \\) on the point \\( p \\), in the directions \\( pm \\), \\( pg \\), \\( po \\).\n\nIf we keep the same denominations as before, and put, besides, \\( r' = \\text{tang. umr} \\), it is plain from the last proposition, and because the action of the whole must necessarily equal the sum of the actions of its parts, that\n\n\\[\nA = \\phi(a, b, r) + \\phi(a, b, r') - \\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r}) - \\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r'});\n\\]\n\n\\[\nB = \\chi(a, b, r) + \\chi(a, b, r'); \\quad C = \\psi(a, b, r) - (a, b, r').\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( umv \\) is a right angle, we shall evidently have arc\n\\[(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r}) + \\text{arc} (\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r'}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi \\text{ being the number } 3.1415, \\&c.: \\text{ this makes the expression for } A \\text{ somewhat simpler, in that case.}\\]\n\nIf it is the triangle vmu' whose attraction we seek, we have, putting \\( r' = \\text{tang. } u'mr \\),\n\n\\[A = \\phi(a, b, r) - \\phi(a, b, r') - \\text{arc} (\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r}) + \\text{arc} (\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r'});\\]\n\n\\[B = \\chi(a, b, r) - \\chi(a, b, r'); \\quad C = \\psi(a, b, r) - \\psi(a, b, r').\\]\n\nCor. 1. As a rhombus may be divided, from its centre, into four equal triangles, like that in fig. 2, but right angled at m, the angle lying at the centre; if \\( b \\) represent a perpendicular from the centre of a rhombus on one of its sides, and \\( r \\) and \\( r' \\) the tangents of the angles, that this perpendicular makes, at the centre, with the semi-diameters of the figure, we shall have for the action of the rhombus, on a point situated perpendicularly over its centre, at the distance \\( a \\),\n\n\\[A = 4\\phi(a, b, r) + 4\\phi(a, b, r') - 2\\pi.\\]\n\nCor. 2. As any plane, terminated by right lines, may be divided into triangles from a point within it, we may find, by means of this proposition, the attraction of such a plane, on a point above it, both in quantity and direction. Let, for example, uvu'v'u, fig. 6, be the plane, \\( p \\) the attracted point; let fall the perpendicular \\( pm \\) on the plane, and from \\( m \\) draw right lines to the angles \\( u, v, u', v' \\); the plane will thus be divided into triangles, situated, with respect to the point \\( p \\), like that in the proposition.\n\nThe attraction may still be found, if the perpendicular should fall without the figure; as in\nProp. 3.\n\nTo find the attraction of a triangle umv, fig. 3, on a point p any how situated.\n\nLet fall from p the perpendicular pm', on the plane of the triangle; join m'm, m'u, m'v. Find, by the last Prop. the attractions of the triangles m'uv, m'um, m'vm, on the point p; and resolve them into others in the directions of any three rectangular co-ordinates: and, when thus resolved, let the actions of\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\{m'uv\\} & \\text{ in the directions of these } \\\\\n\\{m'um\\} & \\text{ co-ordinates be } \\\\\n\\{m'vm\\} & \\{A, B, C\\} \\\\\n& \\{A', B', C'\\} \\\\\n& \\{A'', B'', C''\\}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt is plain, that the actions of the triangle umv, on p, in the directions of the same co-ordinates, will be\n\n\\[A - A' - A''; \\quad B - B' - B''; \\quad C - C' - C''.\\]\n\nThere may be other cases of this proposition, in which the triangle and point are placed differently, with respect to each other, from what I have represented in fig. 3; but the reader, who understands the case that has been considered, will have no difficulty in any other that may occur.\n\nThough the preceding propositions contain every thing that is necessary, for finding the attraction, both in quantity and direction, of any plane bounded by right lines; yet there are some cases worthy of a particular notice: as\n\nProp. 4.\n\nTo find the attraction of a rectangle mrvr', fig. 4, on a point p situated perpendicularly over one of its corners as m.\n\nDraw pg, po, parallel to mr, mr', the sides of the rectangle; put \\(b = rm, b' = r'm, r = \\text{tang. } rmv, r' = \\text{tang. } r'mv\\): then, if\nA, B, C represent the actions of the rectangle, in the directions pm, pg, po, we find, by means of Proposition 1,\n\n\\[ A = \\phi(a, b, r) + \\phi(a, b', r') - \\frac{\\pi}{2}; \\]\n\n\\[ B = \\chi(a, b, r) + \\psi(a, b', r'); \\quad C = \\psi(a, b, r) + \\chi(a, b', r'). \\]\n\nWe may eliminate \\( r \\) and \\( r' \\), from these expressions, by means of their values \\( \\frac{b'}{b} \\) and \\( \\frac{b}{b'} \\); and thus we may put A under a very simple form. It becomes, at first,\n\n\\[ A = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{b}{b'} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + b'^2}}{a}) + \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{b'}{b} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + b'^2}}{a}) - \\frac{\\pi}{2}. \\]\n\nBut, by trigonometry, \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) representing any angles whatever, \\( \\tan(\\alpha + \\beta) = \\frac{\\tan \\alpha + \\tan \\beta}{1 - \\tan \\alpha \\times \\tan \\beta} \\): the application of which formula gives us, instead of the foregoing expression,\n\n\\[ A = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{-a}{bb'} \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + b'^2}) - \\frac{\\pi}{2}; \\]\n\nand this again is easily changed into the following form,\n\n\\[ A = \\text{arc tan. } = \\frac{bb'}{a \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + b'^2}}, \\]\n\nwhich is easily perceived to be the same as Mr. PLAYFAIR's expression.\n\nIn a similar manner, might the expressions for B and C be simplified: but it is perhaps easier to find new forms, ab initio. Thus we may get B immediately, from the double integral\n\n\\[ B = \\iint \\frac{T \\dot{i} i}{(a^2 + t^2 + T^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\nif the fluent, with respect to \\( t \\), be taken from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = b' \\); and, with respect to \\( T \\), from \\( T = 0 \\) to \\( T = b \\). The first integration gives\n\n\\[ B = \\int \\frac{b'T \\dot{T}}{(a^2 + T^2)(a^2 + b'^2 + T^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}, \\]\n\nand, by the second,\n\n\\[ B = L \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + b'}}{a} - L \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + b'^2 + b'}}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}. \\]\nIt is plain that, to find $C$, we need only change $b$ into $b'$, and the reverse, in the last expression, whence\n\n$$C = L \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + b}{a} - L \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b'^2} + b'}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b'^2}}.$$  \n\n**Prop. 5.**\n\nTo find the attraction of a regular polygon, on a point situated perpendicularly over its centre.\n\nAs this figure is composed of isosceles triangles, if we put $b$ for the perpendicular from the centre on one of the sides, and $r$ for the tangent of half the angle at the centre, subtended by one of those sides, we have, by Prop. 1, for a polygon of $n$ sides,\n\n$$A = 2n \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1+r^2}{a^2} b^2}) - 2n \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r}),$$\n\nwhich, because the last term $= (n-2) \\pi$, by Euclid 1.32.\n\n**Cor. 1,** is\n\n$$A = 2n \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1+r^2}{a^2} b^2}) - (n-2) \\pi.$$  \n\n**Prop. 6.**\n\nTo find the attraction of a circle, on a point situated perpendicularly over its centre.\n\nThis is only a particular case of the last proposition, when $n$ is infinitely great and $r$ infinitely small.\n\nIt is easy to see, that the arc whose tangent is $\\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1+r^2}{a^2} b^2}$ will have for its cosine $\\frac{ra}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$, if we keep only the first power of $r$; consequently we may put it under the form $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\text{ arc (sine } = \\frac{ra}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{ra}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}},$ very nearly; this multi-\nplied by $2n$ is $n\\pi - \\frac{2\\pi ra}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = n\\pi - \\frac{2\\pi a}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$ by putting $\\pi$ for $nr$. If we substitute this value in the expression for a regular polygon, it becomes $A = 2\\pi \\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\right\\}$, the well known expression of Newton.\n\n§ II.\n\nOf the Attraction of Pyramids, and generally of any Solids whatever that are bounded by Planes.\n\nThe simplest case of the attraction of such bodies as we are to consider, is that of a pyramid with the attracted point at the vertex: and it fortunately happens, that on this simple case the action of any body whatever may be made to depend; which is the reason of my placing the general problem in this section, though I afterwards treat separately of prisms.\n\nThis facility, in the case of pyramids, results from what was shewn in Cor. 1. Prop. 1, viz. that if we put $x$ for $a$ and $mx$ for $b$, in the functions $\\phi(a, b, r), \\chi(a, b, r), \\psi(a, b, r)$, they will become $\\phi(1, m, r), \\chi(1, m, r) \\psi(1, m, r)$, into which $x$ does not enter.\n\nProp. 7.\n\nLet figure 5 represent a pyramid with a triangular base umv, the vertex p of the solid being in a line pm, perpendicular to the triangle at the angular point m. It is required to find the action of the pyramid on a point at that vertex.\n\nDraw the perpendicular mr, also pg, po parallel to mr, rv. Join pr, and let $r'm'$ be parallel to rm. Call pm', $x$; $r'm'$, $y$; then $y = mx$, $m$ being the tangent of the angle rpm. The attraction of a triangular section of the solid, made by a plane,\npassing through \\( r'm' \\), parallel to the base, will be found by Prop. 2, if we put \\( x \\) for \\( a \\), and \\( mx \\) for \\( b \\); and is in the respective directions \\( pm \\), \\( pg \\), \\( po \\).\n\n\\[\nA = \\phi(1, m, r) + \\psi(1, m, r') - \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\text{)} - \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r'} \\text{)};\n\\]\n\n\\[\nB = \\chi(1, m, r) + \\chi(1, m, r'); C = \\psi(1, m, r) - \\psi(1, m, r').\n\\]\n\nIf we multiply these by \\( x \\) and take the fluents, the actions of the pyramid are found to be\n\n\\[\nA = x\\phi(1, m, r) + x\\phi(1, m, r') - x \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\text{)} - x \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r'} \\text{)};\n\\]\n\n\\[\nB = x\\chi(1, m, r) + x\\chi(1, m, r'); C = x\\psi(1, m, r) - x\\psi(1, m, r').\n\\]\n\nIf the pyramid, whose action we were seeking, had been that whose is \\( u'mv \\), we must have used the other values of \\( A, B, C \\) given in Prop. 2.\n\n**Prop. 8.**\n\nLet fig. 6 represent any pyramid whatever, whose base \\( uvu'v'u \\) is terminated by right lines; to find its attraction, on a point at the vertex \\( p \\), both in quantity and direction.\n\nLet a perpendicular from \\( p \\) meet the base at \\( m \\), and draw lines from this point to all the angles \\( u, v, \\&c. \\) of the base. It is plain, that the solid will thus be divided into such pyramids as were considered in the last proposition; so that the problem is already solved.\n\n**Cor.** We may apply this to the pyramid whose base is a rhombus, and the vertex placed perpendicularly over its centre. By proceeding as in the proposition, it will be divided\ninto four equal triangular pyramids; and, using for each of them the notation of Prop. 7, we have for the action of the whole rhomboidal pyramid, on a point at its vertex,\n\n\\[ A = 4x\\phi(1, m, r) + 4x\\phi(1, m, r') - 2\\pi x. \\]\n\nThe other attractions evidently destroy each other.\n\nIt is not necessary, in the above proposition, that the perpendicular pm should fall within the base; if it falls without, we shall however have occasion for the following problem.\n\n**Prop. 9.**\n\nLet umv, fig. 3, be any triangle whatever, p a point anyhow situated with respect to it; join pm, pu, pv.* It is required to find the attraction of the oblique pyramid pumv, whose base is the triangle umv, on a point at the vertex p.\n\nLet fall, from p, the perpendicular pm' on the plane of the base umv, draw the lines m'm, m'u, m'v.

It is required to determine its attraction on a point at p, in the directions pm, pr', po; po being parallel to r'v'.\n\nIf we wish to obtain a solution by means of what has been already done, we may conceive the solid under consideration to be divided into two pyramids; viz. the pyramid pmrv with the triangular base mrv; and the other pyramid pr'v'vr, whose base is the rectangle r'v'vr; the point p being at the common vertex of both.\n\nPut pm = x, mr = pr' = x'; conceive the diagonal vr' to be drawn, and put tang. rmv = tang. r'pv' = r; tang. v'rr = r'; tang. vr'v' = r''; tang. rpm = m; tang. rpr' = m'.\n\nWe get immediately, from propositions 7 and 10 (putting A, B, C for the respective actions in the directions pm, pr', po)\n\n\\[ A = x\\phi(1, m, r) - x \\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r}) + x'\\chi(1, m', r') + x'\\psi(1, r, r''); \\]\n\n\\[ B = x\\chi(1, m, r) + x'\\phi(1, m', r') + x'\\phi(1, r, r'') - x'\\frac{\\pi}{2}; \\]\n\n\\[ C = x\\psi(1, m, r) + x'\\psi(1, m', r') + x'\\chi(1, r, r''). \\]\n\nIn finding these values, the first expressions of Prop. 10 were made use of; if we take the others, there will result the simpler forms\n\n\\[ A = x\\phi(1, m, r) - x \\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{1}{r}) + x'\\left\\{ L.\\left(\\sqrt{1+r^2}+r\\right) - L.\\frac{\\sqrt{1+r^2+m'^2}+r}{\\sqrt{1+m'^2}} \\right\\}; \\]\n\n\\[ B = x\\chi(1, m, r) + x'\\text{arc}(\\text{tang.} = \\frac{rm'}{\\sqrt{1+r^2+m'^2}}); \\]\n\\[ C = x \\psi (1, m, r) + x' \\left\\{ L \\cdot \\left( \\sqrt{1 + m'^2} + m' \\right) - L \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + m'^2 + r^2} + m'}{\\sqrt{1 + r^2}} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nThese are, perhaps, as simple expressions as can be had in this case; we may however find others; nor is it necessary to conceive the solid divided into pyramids.\n\nThus we may obtain the value of the force \\( A \\), by the method of the preceding propositions: a triangular section of the prism, parallel to the end \\( r'pv' \\), and at a distance \\( x \\) from that end, will have its action on \\( p \\) expressed by \\( \\phi (x, x', r) = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r}) \\), using the same notation as before; therefore, the action of the pyramid, in the direction \\( pm \\), is\n\n\\[ A = \\int x \\phi (x, x', r) - x \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r}) = F(x', r, x) - x \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r}) + \\text{ corr.} \\]\n\nAnother Way of finding the force \\( B \\).\n\nDraw \\( ks \\) parallel to \\( r'v' \\); call \\( pk, x' \\); then \\( ks = r \\times x' \\).

It is in the first place evident, that by means of this proposition, we may find, by parts, the force, both in quantity and direction, with which a point q, any where on the edge pm of the scalene prism represented by fig. 9, is attracted.\n\nThe same may be said of the action on p' any where in the produced axis; this will be the difference of the actions of two prisms, like that in the figure.\n\nCor. 2. Moreover, if, instead of the prism in fig. 9, the point q was placed any where on the edge of a prism whose base is the triangle quv, fig. 10, the action may still be found; for it will now depend on the difference of the action of such prisms as were treated of in the Proposition; that is to say, the action of the prism whose base is quv as the difference of the actions of those whose bases are qvr, qur, qr being a perpendicular on vu produced.\nProp. 21.\n\nTo find the quantity and direction of the attraction of a right prism, whose base is any triangle whatever, on a point anywhere on its surface.\n\nLet the triangle uvu', fig. 11, be a section of the prism, parallel to its base, and through the attracted point p. Let fall the perpendiculars pr, pr', on the opposite sides: and the solid may be divided into four prisms, whose bases are the right angled triangles pur, prv, pvr', pr'u', and the attraction of each of these, both in quantity and direction, is given by Prop. 20.\n\nIt is plain that there may be other cases of this problem, besides the one here considered; for instance, one of the perpendiculars may fall beyond the base; but it would be endless, in a subject of this kind, to consider every particular case, and in none can the intelligent reader find the smallest difficulty.\n\nProp. 22.\n\nTo find the attraction of any prism, fig. 12, whose base is a convex polygon uvu'v', on a point q anywhere within it.\n\nAs such a solid may be divided into triangular prisms, like those in Prop. 20 and its corollaries, with the attracted point on the common edge pm, the problem is already solved.\n\nIf the point be at p', in the line mp produced, the action on it may still be found, being the difference of the actions of two prisms, like that in the figure.\n\nProp. 23.\n\nLet vuv', fig. 13, be the section of an isosceles prism; pv a line passing through the vertex v perpendicularly on the\nmiddle of the base. It is required to find the action of the prism on any point p in the line pv.\n\nThis action is equal to the action of the prism whose base is the triangle v'pu (given by Prop. 20), less the actions of the prisms whose bases, or sections, are the triangles v'vp, uvp, which are found by Cor. 2, Prop. 20.\n\nScholium.\n\nI considered here only an isosceles prism; but the solution is just the same, if the section of the prism is any triangle whatever, as v'uv, fig. 14, and the action on a point p, (situated in the line uv produced) is required. For the attraction wanted will be the difference of attractions of the two prisms whose bases are the triangles v'up, v'vp, and these are given by Cor. 2, Prop. 20.\n\nSuppose the base of the prism, whose attraction is required, to be the trapezium v'uαβ, fig. 14, the action of this on p, being the difference of the actions of the triangular prisms, whose bases are v'uv, βαv, is found by the case just now considered.\n\nIn this manner, might cases be multiplied without end; but I think it is sufficiently plain, that by means of the preceding propositions and scholium, we may find the action of any prism whatever, on a point either within or without it.\n\n§. IV.\n\nOf the Attraction of certain Solids not terminated by Planes.\n\nThe expressions, arrived at in the first section, are useful in finding the attraction, not only of such solids as are bounded by planes, but of a great variety of others; viz. of such as\nhave their sections in one direction continuous curves, whilst, being cut in a different way, there results, from their intersection with a plane, a polygon, or rectangle, or some other right lined figure.\n\nAs no one, that I know of, has considered the actions of such bodies, I shall offer no apology for giving a few examples.\n\nLet $uvv'u'$, fig. 15, represent any regular polygon, whose plane is perpendicular to the line $pm$, and its centre in that line: moreover, let this polygon be variable in magnitude, and move parallel to itself in the direction $pm$, in such a manner, that the middle point $r$ of each of its sides $uv$, may describe a given curve $pr$.\n\n**Prop. 24.**\n\nLet it be required to find the attraction of the solid thus generated by the polygon, when the curve $pr$ is a circle,* and the attracted point at the vertex $p$ of the solid.\n\nThe attraction of a regular polygon was found in Prop. 5, and it will be adapted to our present purpose, by putting $x^a$ for $a^*$, and $2kx - x^a$ for $b^*$, where $k$ is the radius of the circle $pr$: and we have, for the attraction of the solid,\n\n$$A = 2nfx \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1+r^2}{x^2}(2kx-x^2)} \\text{) } - (n-2)\\pi x$$\n\nor $$A = 2nfx \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{rx} \\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)x-r^2x^2} \\text{) } - (n-2)\\pi x.$$  \n\nThat part of $A$, under the sign of integration, equals\n\n$$2nx \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{rx} \\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)x-r^2x^2} \\text{) } - 2nfx \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{rx} \\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)x-r^2x^2},$$\n\n* We may, not improperly, term this solid a *polygonal sphere*.\nand, if we put $zz = x$, the last term becomes\n\n$$-2n \\int_{\\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)-r^2z^2}}^{z^2} \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{rz} \\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)-r^2z^2})$$\n\n$$= 2n \\int_{\\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)-r^2z^2}}^{z^2} \\frac{rz^2}{\\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)-r^2z^2}}; \\text{ this fluent is}$$\n\n$$2n \\left\\{ k \\frac{(1+r^2)}{r^2} \\text{arc (sine } = \\frac{rz}{\\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)}} \\right\\} - \\frac{1}{2} z \\sqrt{\\frac{2k(1+r^2)}{r^2} - z^2} \\right\\}$$\n\nor by putting its value for $z$,\n\n$$\\frac{znk(1+r^2)}{r^2} \\text{arc (sine } = \\frac{r\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)}}) - n \\sqrt{\\frac{2k(1+r^2)}{r^2} x - x^2}.$$ \n\nCollecting all the parts of $A$, we have at length\n\n$$A = 2nx \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{rx} \\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)x - r^2x^2}) - \\frac{n}{r}$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)x - r^2x^2} + \\frac{znk(1+r^2)}{r^2} \\text{arc (sine } = \\frac{r\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)}}) - (n-2)\\pi x + \\text{corr.}$$\n\nBut it is easy to see that each of the arcs in this expression is the complement of the other; put then $A = \\text{arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{rx} \\sqrt{2k(1+r^2)x - r^2x^2})$ and the expression becomes\n\n$$A = \\left\\{ \\frac{nk}{r^2} + n(k-x) \\right\\} (\\pi - 2A) + 2x\\pi - nx \\cdot \\text{tang.

Let \\( r' \\) be infinite, then \\( r = 0 \\), and the solid becomes an infinitely long circular cylinder; and it is easy to see that the value of \\( A \\) is reduced to \\( 2k\\pi \\), as we found before in a different manner.\n\nThe foregoing problems, which I have chosen from a great\nvariety that occurred to me, are sufficient to shew the use that may be made of the expressions given in the first section.\n\nThe attractions of certain infinitely long cylinders, which were derived, as corollaries, from some of the preceding propositions, present us with several curious relations; with these I shall terminate the present division of my subject.\n\nLet pout, fig. 18, represent the base, or section, of a circular cylinder, infinitely extended both above and below the plane of the figure. Let p be an attracted point in the circumference of the section. Draw the diameter pu, and, at right angles to it, the diameter ot.\n\nBy Cor. 1, Prop. 27, the action of the whole cylinder on the point p is $2k\\pi$ ($k$ being the radius of the circular section); the action of that half of the cylinder, whose base is the semicircle opto, is $2k(\\pi - 1)$; the action of the other half of the cylinder, which is furthest from p, is $2k$: therefore,\n\n1. The attraction of a sphere is to that of an infinite circular cylinder of the same diameter (on a point at the surface of each) as $\\frac{3}{4}$ to 1, which is the ratio of the solidity of a sphere to that of its circumscribing cylinder.\n\n2. The attraction of the whole infinite cylinder, on p, is to the attraction of that half which is furthest from that point, as the circumference of a circle is to its diameter.\n\n3. Consequently, the attraction of the nearest half, is to that of the furthest half, as the difference between the circumference and diameter of a circle is to the diameter; or nearly as 2 to 1.\n\n4. In the circle optu, fig. 18, inscribe the parabola owpvt, whose equation is $kx = y^2$, so that its vertex may be at p, and its axis coincide with pu: this parabola will plainly cut the\ncircle at the quadrantal points o and t; and, I say, that the action, on the point p, of the infinitely long cylinder, whose base is the parabolic area owpvtco, is to the attraction of the furthest half of the infinite circular cylinder, exactly as 2 to 1. For the latter action has been shewn to be $2k$; and if in the expression, obtained in Cor. 2, Prop. 27, we make $a$ and $x$ both $= k$, it is reduced to $A = 4k$.\n\n5. In fig. 18, draw fug perpendicular to pu at u; and from p, through o and t, the lines pof, ptg. The attraction, on the point p, of the infinitely long prism whose base is the triangle pfg, is equal to the attraction of the infinitely long circular cylinder. For the action of the prism is $4 \\times pu \\times \\text{arc. fpu}$ (by Prop. 20) $= 8k \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 2k\\pi$; and this has been already shewn to be the attraction of the circular solid.\n\n§ V.\n\nOf Solids of greatest Attraction.\n\nThe subject of this section has occupied the attention of Mr. PLAYFAIR,* in the same paper I have before noticed; it had previously been treated of by SILVABELLE. FRISI also, in the third volume of his works, gives a solution of the same problem as that which is first considered by Mr. PLAYFAIR, but his result is an erroneous one. None of these writers have pursued the matter any further than what relates to the figure of a homogeneous solid of revolution. My manner of treat-\n\n* The problems which I investigate are similar to the first of Mr. PLAYFAIR's, where the equation of a curve is sought; nor do I at all meddle with that other class of problems which he treats of in the subsequent part of the paper.\ning the subject connects it intimately with the preceding parts of this paper; otherwise I should not have given the following problems a place here.\n\n**Prop. 31.**\n\nSuppose that a given quantity of matter is to be formed into a right cylinder of the length $2d$; what must be the figure of its base, so that it shall attract, with the greatest force possible, a point in its surface, and in the middle with respect to its two ends?\n\nLet fig. 19 represent a section of the cylinder, at the attracted point $p$, parallel to its base. It is plain enough, that, whatever is the nature of the curve $pab$, we may draw a line $pb$ from $p$, which shall divide the area into two equal and similar portions $pabp$, $pcbp$.\n\nPut the absciss $pd = x$, the ordinate $ad = y$: the mass of the cylinder is $4dfy\\dot{x}$; and, by Prop. 4, its attraction on $p$ is\n\n$$4f\\dot{x} \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{dy}{x \\sqrt{d^2 + x^2 + y^2}}).$$\n\nLet $C$ be a constant quantity, and we have only to make the fluxion of the following expression, with respect to $y$, equal to nothing,* viz.\n\n$$\\text{Arc (tang. } = \\frac{dy}{x \\sqrt{d^2 + x^2 + y^2}}) + Cdy:$$\n\nthis gives\n\n$$\\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2) \\sqrt{d^2+x^2+y^2}} + C = 0,$$\n\nor $(x^2 - C^2)x^2 + y^2)(d^2 + x^2 + y^2) = 0,$\n\nfor the equation of the curve $pab$. Make $y = 0$, and let $a$ be the corresponding value of $x$; the equation becomes\n\n$$1 - C^2a^2(d^2 + a^2) = 0,$$\n\nwhence $C^2 = \\frac{1}{a(d^2 + a^2)}$; by substituting\n\n* Euler \"Methodus, &c.\" p. 42 and 185-6-7.\nwhich value in the equation of the curve, it is ultimately\n\n\\[ a^2 (d^2 + a^2) x - (x^2 + y^2)^2 (d^2 + x^2 + y^2) = 0. \\]\n\nIt is proper to remark, that though, in the enunciation, I spoke of the point as being in the surface of the cylinder, yet there is nothing in the above method of investigation that supposes it to be in contact with the solid: if there is to be a given distance between them, the nature of the curve will be the same.\n\nCor. 1. If we make \\( d \\) infinitely small, there results\n\n\\[ a^2 x^2 - (x^2 + y^2)^3 = 0 \\]\n\nfor the equation of the curve bounding the plane of greatest attraction; and it is evident, that, by the revolution of this curve about its axis, will be generated the solid of greatest attraction, when it is sought for without any such conditions or restrictions as entered into the preceding problem.\n\nThis exactly agrees with the conclusion arrived at by Silvabelle and Mr. Playfair.\n\nCor. 2. If, on the other hand, we make \\( d \\) infinitely great, the equation is reduced to \\( y^2 = ax - x^2 \\), which is that of a circle whose diameter is \\( a \\), the attracted point being in the circumference. Therefore,—of all infinitely long cylinders, having the areas of their bases, or transverse sections, equal, that which has a circle for the circumference of the said base, shall exert the greatest action on a point at its surface.\n\nProp. 32.\n\nLet a given quantity of matter be fashioned into such a solid as was treated of at the beginning of the last section (in Propositions 24, 25, 26), viz. having its section perpendicular to the axis a regular polygon. The polygon being given in MDCCXII.\nspecies, it is required to determine the nature of the curve pr, fig. 15, so that the solid may have the greatest possible action on a point at its vertex p.\n\nIf we put \\( x \\) for the distance of the generating polygon from the vertex, and \\( y \\) for the perpendicular let fall from the centre of the polygon on one of its sides, the action of the solid is\n\n\\[\n2nfx \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1+r^2}{x^2} y^2} \\bigg) - f(n-2) \\pi \\dot{x}\n\\]\n\nby Prop. 5, and the mass of the solid is \\( nrfy^2 \\dot{x} \\); so that the quantity whose fluxion, with respect to \\( y \\), must \\( = 0 \\), is\n\n\\[\n2n \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{1}{r} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1+r^2}{x^2} y^2} \\bigg) + Cnry^a, \\text{ and we get}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2) \\sqrt{x^2+(1+r^2)y^2}} + C = 0, \\text{ or } x^2 - C^2 (x^2+y^2)^2 (x^2+(1+r^2)y^2) = 0.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( a \\) be the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 0 \\), then \\( C = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), and the equation of the curve becomes\n\n\\[\na^4x^2 - (x^2+y^2)^2 \\left\\{ x^2 + (1+r^2)y^2 \\right\\} = 0.\n\\]\n\nWhen the polygon is a circle, \\( r = 0 \\), and the equation is reduced to \\( a^4x^4 - (x^2+y^2)^3 = 0 \\), the same as we found in Cor. 1, Prop. 31.\n\nLemma 1.\n\nTo find the attraction of the right prism whose base is the triangle mrv, fig. 1, and height \\( a \\), on the point \\( p \\), in the direction pm; on the supposition, that the density at the ordinate ks is as any function of the absciss \\( mk \\), and distance pm.\n\nIf we use the same notation as in Prop. 1, and put \\( f(a,T) \\) for the density of a particle anywhere at the line ks, we shall find, by proceeding, as we did there,\n\n\\[\nA = a \\int \\frac{\\arctan(a,T) T \\dot{T}}{(a^2+T^2)(a^2+(1+r^2)T^2)}.\n\\]\nHence the attraction of a prism, whose height is \\(a\\), and base a regular polygon of \\(n\\) sides, composed of triangles having such a law of density as was supposed above, will be, on a point placed perpendicularly over its centre,\n\n\\[ A = 2na \\int \\frac{arf(a,T) T \\dot{T}}{(a^2 + T^2)(a^2 + (1+r^2)T^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\nThis expression would be easily integrable on various suppositions. Thus we might conceive the density at the ordinate ks to vary as the line ps, drawn from the attracted point to its extremity s; this would be to make \\(f(a,T) = \\sqrt{a^2 + (1+r^2)T^2}\\); whence\n\n\\[ A = 2na \\int \\frac{arT \\dot{T}}{a^2 + T^2} = rna \\dot{a} \\left\\{ L \\cdot (a^2 + T^2) - L \\cdot a^2 \\right\\} \\]\n\nAgain, we might suppose \\(f(a,T) = a^2 + T^2 = (pk)^2\\); this would give\n\n\\[ A = 2na \\int \\frac{arT \\dot{T}}{\\sqrt{a^2 + (1+r^2)T^2}} = \\frac{2nra \\dot{a}}{1+r^2} \\left\\{ \\sqrt{a^2 + (1+r^2)T^2} - a \\right\\} \\]\n\nBut the kind of problems we are engaged about does not require us to know the value of \\(A\\) itself; its fluxional coefficient with respect to \\(T\\) being alone wanted, and this is always\n\n\\[ \\frac{2narf(a,T) T}{(a^2 + T^2) \\sqrt{a^2 + (1+r^2)T^2}} \\times \\dot{a} \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (1) \\]\n\nFor suppose we had actually found the fluent; when we make use of it in such a problem as the last, we must change \\(T\\) into \\(y\\), and take the fluxion with respect to \\(y\\), and the result must necessarily be\n\n\\[ \\frac{2narf(a,y) y}{(a^2 + y^2) \\sqrt{a^2 + (1+r^2)y^2}} \\times \\dot{a} \\]\n\nwhich we might have arrived at simply by changing \\(T\\) into \\(y\\) in the expression marked (1).\n\n**Lemma 2.**\n\nTo find the quantity of matter in a right prism, whose base is the triangle \\(rmv\\), fig. 1, and height \\(a\\); supposing the density at any ordinate ks to be \\(f(a,T)\\).\nThe magnitude of the element of the prism is \\(aTrT\\), and the mass of this element is \\(ra \\times f(a,T) TT\\); whence the mass of the whole prism is \\(raf(a,T) TT\\).\n\nThe mass of a prism whose height is \\(a\\) and base a regular polygon of \\(n\\) sides, formed of triangles having this law of density, is \\(2nrarf(a,T) TT\\) and its fluxional coefficient, with respect to \\(T\\), is \\(2nr f(a,T) T \\times a\\).\n\n**Prop. 33.**\n\nLet the last proposition be again proposed, but with this difference, that the solid, instead of being homogeneous, is to be formed of polygonal prismatic elements, having such a law of density as in the preceding lemmas.\n\nBy proceeding as before, we shall have for the equation of the curve \\(pr\\), fig. 15,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2nxrf(x,y)y}{(x^2+y^2)\\sqrt{x^2+(1+r^2)y^2}} + C2nr f(x,y) y = 0,\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)\\sqrt{x^2+(1+r^2)y^2}} + C = 0; \\text{ which is exactly the same equation as when the solid was supposed to be homogeneous.}\n\\]\n\nWhen \\(r = 0\\), we have, as before, \\(a^4x^2 = (x^2+y^2)^2\\); which shews that the result of Mr. PLAYFAIR extends to an infinity of cases besides that of homogeneity.\n\nWhen, as in our last supposition, \\(r = 0\\), and the mass is a solid of revolution, the function \\(f(a,T)\\) expressing the density, is a function of the perpendicular let fall from any particle on the axis of the solid, and of the distance between the foot of that perpendicular and the attracted point.\nScholium.\n\nIf the preceding lemmas had been treated on the supposition that the density was variable along the line ks, fig. 1, (which is the same as making the density $f(t)$, or more generally $f(a, T, t)$ a function of $a$, $T$, and $t$) their application to the problem we have been considering, would give an indefinite number of different equations, for the curve pr, fig. 15, according to the nature of the assumed function $f(a, T, t)$: every one of which equations will, however, have this peculiarity, that if we make $r = 0$, it will become $a^2x^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2$. For when $r = 0$, $t = 0$, and $f(a, T, t)$ becomes a function of $a$ and $T$ only, and the case enters into Prop. 33 just now considered.\n\nIt may be worth while to see an example of this; we should have had, in general, for the action of the polygonal prismatic element of the solid, by Prop. 1,\n\n$$A = 2na \\int \\int \\frac{af(a, T, t)}{(a^2 + T^2 + t^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\dot{T} \\dot{t};$$\n\nand the mass of the same element would have been\n\n$$2na \\int \\int f(a, T, t) \\dot{T} \\dot{t}.$$\n\nThese must be integrated, with respect to $t$, from $t = 0$ to $t = rT$: which cannot be done till we assign a form for the function $f(a, T, t)$. Let this be $a^2 + T^2 + t^2$, that is to say, let the density at any point q, in the triangle vrm, be as the square of its distance pq from the attracted point p. This will give\n\n$$A = 2na \\int \\int \\frac{af(a, T, t)}{(a^2 + T^2 + t^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = 2na \\int \\left\\{ L(rT + \\sqrt{a^2 + (1 + r^2)T^2}) - L \\sqrt{a^2 + T^2} \\right\\} \\dot{T};$$\n\nand for the mass\nIf therefore we solve Prop. 32, on this supposition of density, we have for the equation of the curve pr, fig. 15, when the solid has the greatest attraction,\n\n\\[ xL \\left( ry \\sqrt{x^2 + (1 + r^2) y^2} \\right) - xL \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + C \\left( x^2 ry + ry^3 + \\frac{r^3 y^3}{3} \\right) = 0. \\]\n\nNow, when \\( r \\) is infinitely small, we shall have, by neglecting all the higher powers thereof,\n\n\\[ L \\left( ry + \\sqrt{x^2 + (1 + r^2) y^2} \\right) = L \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \\frac{ry}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}; \\]\n\nby substituting which our equation becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} + C \\left( x^2 + y^2 \\right), \\text{ or } a^4 x^4 - (x^2 + y^2)^3 = 0, \\text{ as we shewed } a \\text{ priori must necessarily happen.} \\]\n\nI shall just remark here, that, as the results of Prop. 32, are not altered by conceiving the density any function of \\( a \\) and \\( T \\), such is also the case with respect to Problem 31, if \\( T \\) there represent the distance of any particle from a plane passing through the attracted point and the axis of the cylinder. This the reader may easily convince himself of.\n\nThe proposition just mentioned (31) is only a particular case of the following very general one.\n\n**Prop. 34.**\n\nLet \\( uvv'u' \\), fig. 15, be a rectangle, whose plane is perpendicular to the line \\( pm \\), and its centre in that line. Let this rectangle move parallel to itself, in the direction \\( pm \\), and vary in such a manner, that the middle points \\( r \\) and \\( r' \\) of its sides may continually touch two different curves.\nThe quantity of matter in the solid so generated being given, and the nature of one of the curves as pr', to find what must be the other curve pr, so that the action of the solid, on a point at its vertex p, may be the greatest possible.\n\nPut \\( x \\) for the absciss pm, \\( y' \\) and \\( y \\) for the ordinates mr', mr; then by Prop. 4, the action of the solid will be\n\n\\[\n4\\int x \\text{ arc (tang. } = \\frac{yy'}{x \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+y'^2}}); \\text{ and its mass is } 4\\int yy'x.\n\\]\n\nBut \\( y' \\) is a given function of \\( x \\), suppose \\( f(x) \\).

Let \\( f(x) = ax \\), or pr' be a straight line, the equation of pr must be \\( x^2 - C^2(x^2+y^2)^2(1+a^2)x^2+y^2 = 0 \\).\n\nEx. 2. Let pr' be a circle, or \\( f(x)^2 = 2kx - x^2 \\), \\( k \\) being the radius, then \\( x^2 - C^2(x^2+y^2)^2(2kx+y^2) = 0 \\), is the equation of the other curve.\n\nEx. 3. If pr' is a parabola, or \\( f(x)^2 = ax \\), the equation of pr is \\( x^2 - C^2(x^2+y^2)^2(ax+x^2+y^2) = 0 \\).\n\nScholium.\n\nIn Prop. 27, after having found the action of the solid there treated of, we derived, as corollaries, the action of parabolic and circular cylinders of infinite length, by separately making infinite the diameter of the circle and the parameter of the parabola. Perhaps it might therefore be supposed, that if we made \\( k \\) infinite in the second of the preceding examples, or \\( a \\)\ninfinite in the third, the result would be the equation of the base of the infinitely long cylinder of greatest attraction; which however is by no means the case; for that was found to be a circle, whereas the equation we get here is\n\n\\[ x - C' (x^a + y^a) = 0, \\]\n\nand if we make \\( a \\) infinitely great in the first example, the equation becomes \\( C' = x^a + y^a \\), or the line pr is a circle with its centre at the attracted point.\n\nWe might resolve this problem, on a variety of hypotheses respecting the density; or we might add other conditions of a different kind; for instance, not only the mass of the solid, but the area of the section, passing through the required curve pr and axis pm, might be supposed constant. But I pass on to other suppositions respecting the force of attraction; which will be treated with as much brevity as possible.\n\n**Lemma 3.**\n\nTo find the attraction of the triangle vrm, fig. 1, on the point p, in the direction pm, supposing the force to be inversely as the \\( m \\)th power of the distance.\n\nKeeping the same notation as in Prop. 1, we have, for the attraction of an element at q,\n\n\\[ \\frac{Tt}{(a^2 + T^2 + t^2)^{m+1}}; \\]\n\nwhich being resolved, gives, for the force of the whole triangle, in the direction pm,\n\n\\[ A = \\int \\int \\frac{arTt}{(a^2 + T^2 + (1+r^2)T^2)^{m+1}}; \\]\n\nthe fluent is to be taken from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = rT \\), and we have\n\n\\[ A = \\int \\frac{arTt}{(a^2 + T^2)(a^2 + (1+r^2)T^2)^{m+1}} \\left\\{ 1 - (2-m) \\frac{r^2T^2}{3(a^2 + T^2)} + (2-m) \\right. \\]\n\n\\[ \\left.

If we multiply this by $2n$, it will be the attraction of a regular polygon of $n$ sides; and making $n$ infinitely great and $r$ infinitely small, the attraction of a circle to the radius $T$ is found to be\n\n$$A = \\int_{a^2 + T^2}^{2\\pi raTT'} \\frac{-2\\pi ra}{(m-1)(a^2 + T^2)^{m-1}} + \\frac{2\\pi ra}{(m-1)a^{m-1}}$$\n\nwhich, by putting $\\pi$ for $nr$, is\n\n$$A = 2\\pi \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{(m-1)a^{m-2}} - \\frac{a}{(m-1)(a^2 + T^2)^{m-1}} \\right\\}$$\n\nthe same as is found differently by other writers.\n\nCor. 2. When $r$ becomes infinite, the triangle $vrm$ is changed into a parallelogram, infinitely extended in the direction $rv$; and we have\n\n$$A = \\int_{a^2 + T^2}^{aT} \\frac{aT'}{(a^2 + T^2)(rT)^{m-2}} \\left\\{ 1 - (2-m) \\frac{r^2T^2}{3(a^2 + T^2)} + (2-m)(4-m) \\frac{r^4T^4}{3\\cdot5(a^2 + T^2)^2} - \\&c. \\right\\}$$\n\nwhich, when $m$ is an even positive whole number greater than 2, is reduced to $A = \\frac{2\\cdot4\\cdot6\\ldots(m-2)}{3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\ldots(m-1)} \\int_{a^2 + T^2}^{aT} \\frac{aT'}{(a^2 + T^2)^{m-1}}$.\n\nCor. 3. If instead of the action of the triangle $vrm$, that of a rectangle, whose sides are $rm(y)$ and $rv(y')$, had been required, we must have proceeded exactly in the same manner, but the fluent, with respect to $t$, must have been taken from $t = o$, to $t = y'$; so that we have only to substitute $y'$ for $rT$, in the value found by the lemma, and there results\n\n$$A = \\int_{a^2 + T^2}^{ayT'} \\frac{ayT'}{(a^2 + T^2)(a^2 + T^2 + y'^2)^{m-1}} \\left\\{ 1 - (2-m) \\frac{y'^2}{3(a^2 + T^2)} + (2-m)(4-m) \\frac{y'^4}{3\\cdot5(a^2 + T^2)^2} - \\&c. \\right\\}$$\nAnother Method of finding the Action of the Triangle vrm.\n\nThe expressions we have found will terminate only when \\( m \\) is one of the series of numbers 2, 4, 6, &c.

Prolong the sides of the polygon till they meet \\( pq \\) at the points \\( s, s', s'', s''' \\), &c.\n\nPut \\( u = ps, u' = ps', u'' = ps'', u''' = ps''' \\), &c.; and \\( x = sm, \\{ x' = s'm' \\}, \\{ x'' = s''m'' \\}, \\{ x''' = s'''m''' \\}, \\&c. \\)\n\nAlso, let \\( r = \\text{tang. } rsm, r' = \\text{tang. } r's'm', r'' = \\text{tang. } r''s''m'' \\), \\( r''' = \\text{tang. } r'''s'''m''' \\), &c. then it appears from the last proposition, that the attraction, of the upper half of the solid, is\nas are terminated by Planes, &c.\n\nexpressed by\n\n\\[ \\varphi(r, x, u) - \\varphi(r, o, u) + \\varphi(r', x', u') - \\varphi(r', X', u') + \\varphi(r'', x'', u'') - \\varphi(r'', X'', u'') + \\varphi(r''', -x''', u''') - \\varphi(r''', -X''', u''') + \\&c. = \\&c. \\]\n\nAnd in the same manner is found the attraction of the lower portion. If any part of the polygon, as \\( pp' \\), is parallel to \\( pq \\), the attraction of that portion of the solid may be found by Prop. A.\n\n---\n\n**Scholium to Prop. 25, page 273.**\n\nThe following expression includes the attraction (on a point at the pole or vertex) of all this class of solids, where the generating plane is a regular polygon, and guiding curve a conic section: or where \\( y^2 = ax^2 (\\beta x + \\gamma x^2) \\).\n\n\\[ A = 2n \\left( x + \\frac{\\beta a^2}{1 + \\gamma a^2} \\right) \\text{arc} \\left( \\tan^{-1} \\frac{1}{rx} \\sqrt{\\mu x + \\nu x^2} \\right) - \\left\\{ (n - 2) x + \\frac{n \\beta a^2}{1 + \\gamma a^2} \\right\\} \\pi + \\varphi \\]\n\nin which \\( \\mu = \\beta x^2 (1 + r^2) \\), \\( \\nu = 1 + \\gamma x^2 (1 + r^2) \\), and\n\n\\[ \\varphi = \\frac{2nr\\beta a^2}{\\sqrt{\\nu}(1 + \\gamma a^2)} L \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu x}}{\\sqrt{\\mu}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{\\mu}} + 1 \\right), \\text{or} = \\frac{2nr\\beta a^2}{\\sqrt{-\\nu}(1 + \\gamma a^2)} \\text{arc} \\left( \\sin^{-1} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu x}}{\\sqrt{\\mu}} \\right), \\text{accordingly as } \\nu \\text{ is positive or negative.} \\]\n\n**Ex. 1.** Let \\( \\gamma = 0 \\), \\( \\alpha = 1 \\), \\( y = \\beta x \\); in which case the solid is the polygonal parabolic conoid treated of in the proposition; and we have \\( \\mu = \\beta (1 + r^2) \\), \\( \\nu = 1 \\), whence\n\\[ A = 2n (x + \\beta) \\text{arc} (\\tan = \\frac{1}{rx} \\sqrt{\\beta (1 + r^2)x + x^2}) - \\left\\{ (n-2) x + n\\beta \\right\\} \\pi + 2nr\\beta L \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{\\beta (1+r^2)}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{\\beta (1+r^2)}} + 1 \\right), \\]\n\nthe same as was found before.\n\n**Ex. 2.** Let \\( a^2 = \\frac{b^2}{a^2}, \\beta = a, \\gamma = -1, y^2 = \\frac{b^2}{a^2} (ax - x^2): \\)\n\nhere the curve pr, fig. 15, is an ellipsis whose diameters are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( a \\) being that which coincides with the axis pm.
