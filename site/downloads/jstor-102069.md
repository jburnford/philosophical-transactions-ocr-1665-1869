at Ephesus; much more vivid than those 4 tall square Pillars at Tadmor (in its middle age Palmyra) which are each of them but of, I think, one piece; whilst all the rest, exceeding many, of another sort of stone, are of several pieces and round: If you'll attribute the clearness of their Complexion, in part to the Air; which corrodes them especially upon the N. and East; I impose not upon the liberty of your Reason.

If the Ichnography of them (which I desire you to reserve for me) won't excuse me from any farther description, I beg your pardon that I have said thus much, and hazarded my judgment to demonstrate my Affection, how much I am, and endeavour to be,

Your faithful Friend

And humble Servant,

R. H.
