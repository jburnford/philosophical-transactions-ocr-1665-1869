  "text": "Addend. to the Note at p. 319.\n\nI thought it proper to add the following Passage taken out of the Journal-Book of the Royal Society, supposing it to be what Mr. Oldenburgh hints at in his Letter.\n\n\"Nov. 16, 1671. [Sir Robert Moray] exhibited a certain Plant, (which was by Mr. Wray called Lichen terrestris cinereus) said by Sir Robert Moray to be very good to cure Dogs bitten by mad Dogs: His Royal Highness having caused it to be given to a whole Kennel of Dogs, bitten by a mad one, which were all cured, except one of them, to whom none of it was given.\"\n\nThe Specimen was kept in the Repository.\n\nThe same Virtue is likewise ascribed to this Plant, in the Third Part of Morison's Plantar. Hist. Oxon. published at Oxford Anno 1699. in Folio, p. 632. where the Author, speaking of the Lichen terrestris cinereus, Raii Hist. & Synopsis says, Adversus morbum canis rabidi egregium est Medicamentum.\n\nDampier, and the College of Physicians, in their Pulv. Antilyssus, prescribe equal Quantities of the Lichen and Pepper: But Dr. Mead, in a single Quarto Leaf published by him Anno 1735. hath alter'd the Proportions of the Composition, prescribing double the Quantity of Lichen to that of the Pepper. This difference in the Proportions must be left to the Judgment of Practitioners; but upon the Authority of another Minute in the Society's Journal-Books, it may not be improper to make an Addition to the above-mention'd Dampier's Powder.\n\n\"March 7, 1671-2. Sir Robert Moray mention'd, that a whole Kennel of Dogs, belonging to his Royal Highness, were bitten by a mad Dog, and had been lately cured by a certain Herb called Stellaria, or Star of the Earth.\"\n\nThis Plant is the Lychnis viscosa, flore muscofo Casp. Bauhin. in English, Spanish Catch-fly. See these Transactions, No 187. where is a Receipt to cure mad Dogs, &c. wherein this Plant is a principal Ingredient; which Receipt, communicated by Sir Robert Gourdon, was there published by his MAJESTY's [special] Command, Anno 1687.\n\nWherefore, suppose the Composition were to be thus:\n\nTake Ash-colour'd Ground-Liver-wort, black Pepper, and the Herb Spanish Catch-fly, all finely powder'd, of each two Drachms, for four Doses, to be taken as Dampier prescribes in his Letter in these Transactions, No 237.\n\nERRATUM.\n\nP. 336. & alibi, for Ilion, r. Ilium.",
