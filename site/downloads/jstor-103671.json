Since I began this Abstract, I was with the ingen-\nious Author, who by some Experiments try'd since the\nwriting of his Book, was become certain of some\nthings which he spoke doubtfully of before, viz, 1.\nThat the Diaphragm-Instrument (see Page 263, of\nhis Book) wou'd serve to breathe 8 ½ Minutes when\nit was entirely dry, and the Diaphragms impregnated\nwith Salt of Tartar. 2. That Leaves imbibe Air,\nas he has since tried in Mint in the manner that he\nmention'd (in Page 329.) 3. That this year the\nHeat of the Weather has been at 84 Degrees,\nmark'd on his Thermometers.\n\nFINIS.\n\nAdvertisement.\n\nWhereas I publish'd a Paper concerning the Figure of the\nEarth, in the Philosophical Transactions, Numb. 388, and a\nParagraph which I cancell'd, was, by the mistake of my Amanu-\nensis, printed whilst I was sick: I desire such Readers as have\nthat Transaction by them, to cancel from the Words, Lastly, Let us\nsuppose, Page 280.
