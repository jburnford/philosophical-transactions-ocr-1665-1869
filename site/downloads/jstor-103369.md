being then set. Some People observed tall Cones to arise in the East, and to be carryed to the West pretty swiftly in an erect Position, but I saw them not. It has been represented here in all sorts of Appearances, Armies, Battles, &c. and has put abundance of People in dismal Frights: But I had not an Imagination strong enough for it, &c.

VI. A further relation of the same Appearance as seen at Dublin, communicated to the Publisher by an unknown Hand.

It is with pleasure that I now give you the trouble of reading the ensuing Account of the surprizing Lights which on Tuesday the tenth of November we saw in the Northern Semicircle of our Horizon.

The Afternoon was very Calm and Serene; about six in the Evening the Sky was ting'd with a strange kind of Light, and some Streams began to project from the North and North East. One of them arose about N by E. and was nearly a Subtense of an Arc between that and S.W. by West; it was a little curvated toward the Sun, and what I saw of it (for the North part of the Horizon was conceal'd by Houses) very much resembled the tail of a Comet: About the same time there was one or two which arose in the East, ascending obliquely so as to leave the Zenith several Degrees to the Northward.

These Striae continu'd to appear and disappear alternately till toward Eight in the Evening; they were Pyramidal, and their Vertices frequently projected several Degrees to the South of our Zenith.
Between nine and ten I was agreeably surpriz'd with a kind of Coruscation, or Flashing, that shew'd itself between twenty and sixty Degrees from the Zenith, in the South or South by West; and which from four or five, sometimes from more places at once, darted with a Velocity not much inferior to that of Lightning; and by interfering with each other produc'd a beautiful Tremour or Undulation in that subtile Vapour, which I cannot better illustrate, than by comparing it to the Beams of the Sun, reflected on a Ceiling, from the Surfaces of two or three Batons of Water: These Waves of Light were only visible at the instant of Coruscation, and were of a pale whitish Colour, somewhat resembling the flashes produced by the violent agitation of Quicksilver in an Exhausted Receiver; but so strong that a Gentleman who about that time was in a Room by himself, without a Candle, assur'd me he took it for common Lightning: Thus it continued incessantly for more than an Hour, during which time several lucid Areas, like little Clouds, discover'd themselves in the pure Sky, and after they had continu'd about five or six second Minutes, as near as I could guess would instantaneously disappear; most of them pretty much resembled a very thin white Smoke or Vapour illuminated by the Full Moon.

About three quarters past Ten, this Vapour was almost spent, or by a brisk Gale at South by West dispers'd and driven to the Northward; at which time, between the West and North, a vast body of it, like a very bright Flame-colour'd Crepusculum, seem'd to be fix'd: From this Basis several Beams or Striae of shining matter were at uncertain intervals, emitted; and tho' it was not so sensible to the Eastward of the North, yet several mighty Pillars were also ejected from thence; One, which if I mistake not, arose directly under the
the Pole, was, above all others that had preceded it, both as to its Magnitude and Density so surprizing, that I'm persuaded the smallest Print might have been read by the Light thereof, had not that of the Moon, which shone very bright, pretty much effac'd it: 'twas ting'd with a kind of Yellow and Violet Colour. In about two or three Minutes it died away, and was succeeded by others of an inferior Order: It was now about a quarter past Eleven of the Clock, and nothing but repeated Phases of the same Spectacle offering themselves to View; the Vibrating Motion had ceased; the Vapour shewed itself no longer in lucid Areas; the streams of Light were not so frequent, and those more languid than before; and the bright Aurora having settled nearer the Horizon, I concluded the Scene was at an End, and accordingly gave over the quest of new Phenomena, with only observing that about N. E. there appear'd some Clouds that reflected an unusual kind of reddish Light. Others, who thro' a Principle of Fear sat up longer than I did, represent the End with very surprizing Circumstances; but as it escap'd the Eyes of those who were best qualified to oblige the World with an History of it, so I despair of adding anything that may be satisfactory: and there were no doubt many Circumstances of Weight that I did not observe; for the wonderful Variety this Phenomenon afforded, and the frequency and suddenness of its Alterations, made it impossible for the Eye of any single Person to trace it.

On Tuesday the 24th of November we had the same Phenomena repeated, tho' not with the same Variety: About a quarter past ten at Night, a vast Body of shining matter was collected between N. W. by West, and N. by E. in the form of the Segment of a Circle, whose Center was about 25 or 30 Degrees below the Horizon;
Horizon; from its Periphery a few short Pyramidal Streams, of the same luminous Vapour, ascended by a slow and nearly uniform Motion, and were exceeding rare so as not to efface the smallest of the fix'd stars; and in a Minute or two vanish'd: It was very remarkable that the Light which that Collection of Vapour emitted was so great, that in the otherwise very dark Night, I cou'd thereby (at three quarters past Ten) read the Title of the last Philos. Transact. which then happen'd to lye on my Desk; and at four or five Yards distance see the smallest Books in my Study.

VII. An Account of another very considerable Aurora Borealis observed at Streatham in Surrey, by Mr. Thomas Hearne; and Communicated by Coll. Francis Nicholson, R. S. S.

Having seen Dr. Halley's Account of the Coruscations in the Morning and Evening of Novemb. 10th. (and the Letter annexed to it from Devonshire) I had the Pleasure to find the Observations made upon that Appearance very agreeable to what I had myself observed the Evening of that Day; and to what I did not at that time observe, but had an opportunity of observing in the Night of Dec. 11. I believe much more plainly than Dr. Halley had in the Night of November 10.

Dec. 11th. About one a Clock at Night (or rather in the Morning of Dec. 12th) I was called to observe Coruscations which appeared of a much different Colour, and in a very different manner from any I had before seen.
