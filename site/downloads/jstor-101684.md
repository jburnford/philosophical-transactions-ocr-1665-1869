III. The ROYAL ALMANACK, &c. by N. Stevenson, one of his Majesties Gunners.

As I was exceeding glad, to see this ingenious and truly useful Almanack begun to be publish't the last year; so I could not but give notice to the world of its continuation: Being chiefly a Diary of the true Places of the Sun, Moon, and the other Planets, their Rising, Southing, and Setting; High water at London bridge, with Rules to serve other places after the New Theory of Tides, and Directions of Sir Jonas Moor: To which are added the Eclipses, Tables of the Suns Rising, Moons Southing, Moons Rising and Setting; as also a Table of the Suns Right Ascension in Time for every Day at Noon, and of Thirty one of the most notable Fixed Stars: With the Moon and other the Planets Appulses to the Fixed Stars, for the Meridian of London, A. 1676. And lastly, instead of giving the impertinent guesses of the Weather hap-hazard, the Author gives notice of that useful Instrument the Baroscope, telling the changes of weather before-hand, even to admiration. All done with great pains and accurateness, according to the Rules of Art, for his Majesties Use, and at his Command, by N. Stevenson, one of his Majesties Gunners. Printed in London for the Company of Stationers, 1676. in 12°.
