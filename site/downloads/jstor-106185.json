The instrument was set in the middle of a room up one pair of stairs; but being apprehensive that the iron-grate, fender, poker, and tongs, might, in some measure, affect the needle, I determined to make a trial in the open air, and in a place free from such obstacles.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE DIPPING NEEDLE.\n\nOn the Holms in the entrance of Stromness Harbour,\nJune 23, 1774. Variation per azimuth 24° Westerly.\nLong. from London 3° 30' West, lat. 58° 59' North.\n\n76°\n75° 40'\n75° 45'\n\nThe index placed West.\n\n76° 55'\n76° 10'\n76° 30'\n\nThe index placed East.\n\n74° 45'\n75° 30'\n75°\n\nThe poles changed, and index East.\n\n76°\n74° 45'\n75°\n\nThe index placed West.\n\nThe needle in all these observations was left to vibrate\nfrom an horizontal position. The instrument was set\non the top of the case (in which it was packed) and stood\nin the open air, in a fine sunny day.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE DIPPING NEEDLE.\n\nIn Hudson's Straits, July 23, 1774, lat. 62° 3' North, long. 69° West from London, variation 43° Westerly.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n82 & \\quad 50 \\\\\n82 & \\quad 30 \\\\\n82 & \\quad 40 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\] The Index placed East.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n81 & \\quad 50 \\\\\n82 & \\quad 45 \\\\\n83 & \\quad 45 \\\\\n82 & \\quad 40 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\] The index placed West.\n\nThe needle vibrated from an horizontal situation. These observations were made on a large piece of ice, to which the three ships were grappled. I imagine the first four experiments may be depended on, as it was calm weather; but afterwards, a breeze springing up gave the ice a circular motion, which made it impossible to keep the instrument exactly in the magnetic meridian, as may be seen in the fifth and sixth experiments. I re-adjusted the instrument for the last observation; but finding the ice still continued in motion, I judged it unnecessary to make any farther experiments at this time, as it could not be done with that exactness I could wish, or give satisfaction to the learned Society to whom I have the honour of transmitting these remarks.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE DIPPING NEEDLE.\n\nIn Hudson's Straits, July 27, 1774, lat. 62° 23' North,\nlong. 71° 30' West from London, variation 42° 50'\nWesterly per azimuth.\n\n81 45\n83 12\n82 12\n\nThe index placed East.\n\n83 0\n82 45\n83 45\n\nThe index placed West.\n\n83 30\n84 0\n83 35\n\nThe poles changed, and index West.\n\n85 0\n83 25\n83 45\n\nThe index placed East.\n\nI met with the same impediment as in the last trial of\nthe instrument, the field of ice turning round, so as to\nremove the needle constantly out of the magnetic meri-\ndian; however, I endeavoured to be exact, and re-adjust-\ned the position of the instrument twice during the ob-\nservations.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE DIPPING NEEDLE.\n\nIn Hudson's Straits, July 28, 1774, lat. 62° 25' North, long. 71° 30' West from London, variation per azimuth 44° West.\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\n83^\\circ & \\quad \\text{The index pointing West.} \\\\\n83^\\circ & \\\\\n83^\\circ 30' & \\quad \\text{The index pointing East.} \\\\\n83^\\circ & \\\\\n81^\\circ 30' & \\quad \\text{The poles changed, and index East.} \\\\\n81^\\circ 40' & \\\\\n82^\\circ 8' & \\quad \\text{The index pointing West.} \\\\\n82^\\circ & \n\\end{align*} \\]\n\nThese observations were made with the assistance of Captain Richards, on a table in the cabin of the Prince Rupert. We used all imaginary care to render them exact; yet, at the conclusion, I found the ship, though fast to a field of ice, had altered the position of her head: for by placing the index to the North line of the instrument, the needle stood at 88° 10' West, instead of being perpendicular at 90°.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE DIPPING NEEDLE.\n\nIn Hudson's Bay, August 14, 1774, lat. 56° 53' North, long. 85° 22' West from London, variation per azimuth 24° West.\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\n82^\\circ & \\quad \\text{The index placed East.} \\\\\n82^\\circ & \\\\\n82^\\circ & \\\\\n82^\\circ 15 & \\quad \\text{The index placed West.} \\\\\n82^\\circ 20 & \\\\\n82^\\circ 50 & \\quad \\text{The poles changed, and index East} \\\\\n82^\\circ 35 & \\\\\n82^\\circ 30 & \\quad \\text{The index placed East.} \\\\\n82^\\circ 15 &\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\nThese experiments were made in conjunction with Captain Richards, in the cabin of the Prince Rupert, whilst she lay amongst ice. The ship frequently varied the position of her head a point of the compass; but by replacing the instrument as often as we found occasion, I have the greatest reason to think these observations (which took up above three hours) are pretty accurate.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE DIPPING NEEDLE.\n\nAt Moose Fort in Hudson's Bay, September 8, 1774, lat. \n51° 26' North, long. 82° 30' West from London, \nvariation 17° West.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n80^\\circ 25' & \\\\\n80^\\circ 15' & \\text{The index placed West.} \\\\\n80^\\circ 35' & \\\\\n79^\\circ 0 & \\\\\n80^\\circ 30' & \\\\\n81^\\circ 25' & \\text{The Index placed East.} \\\\\n80^\\circ 13' & \\\\\n81^\\circ 13' & \\\\\n79^\\circ 10' & \\\\\n80^\\circ 45' & \\text{The poles reversed, index East.} \\\\\n79^\\circ 50' & \\\\\n79^\\circ 10' & \\\\\n79^\\circ 10' & \\\\\n80^\\circ 25' & \\text{The index placed West.} \\\\\n79^\\circ 45' & \\\\\n80^\\circ 5 &\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe observations were made on shore. So remarkable difference between them, when I was expecting quite the reverse, surprized me as much as the increased inclination of the needle from observations made nearly in the same parallel of latitude in London. I endeavoured, by drawing a magnetical meridional line with chalk, and paying the greatest attention to keeping the instrument perfectly steady and horizontal, to render these experiments accurate, and fulfil the intention of the Royal Society.\nEXPERIMENTS ON THE DIPPING NEEDLE.\n\nAt Albany Fort in Hudson's Bay, September 14, 1774,\nlong. $82^\\circ 30'$ West, lat. $52^\\circ 22'$ North, variation $17^\\circ$\nWest.\n\n$80^\\circ 13'$\n$80^\\circ 25'$\n$79^\\circ 37'$\n$79^\\circ 55'$\n\nI made a trial of the instrument at this place, but\nhaving lost the slip of paper on which I had noted the\nexperiments, I was dubious whether I should insert the\nabove or not. I can only recollect these four, and am\nnot positive which way the index stood; however, I re-\nmember that the mean of all the observations I made\nwas something less than $80^\\circ$. Time will not permit me\nto repeat the operation during the ship's stay in these\nparts; I must therefore defer it to a future period. Du-\nring the winter, I shall have frequent opportunities of\namusing myself this way; and the respect I bear the\nRoyal Society, makes every service I render to that il-\nlustrious body an additional happiness to\n\nTheir devoted servant,\n\nTHOMAS HUTCHINS\n\nAlbany Fort,\nSeptember 17, 1774.\nOBSERVATIONS ON HOY, 1774.\n\n| Month | Hour | Barometer | Thermometer | Weather | Circumstances |\n|-------|------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|\n| 1774- | June | 11       |             |         |               |\n|       | 0    | 15       | 28.63       | 59      | Clear.        | On the top of the hill. |\n|       | 0    | 30       | 28.60       | 56½     | Foggy.        | Ditto. |\n|       | 4    | 15       | 30.22       | 63      | Clear.        | At low water mark. |\n\nHoy is a remarkable high hill near Stromness, in the Orkneys, and is placed by Mr. Mackenzie in lat. 58° 58' North, and long. 3° 30' West from London. The two first observations were made on the highest part of the hill. Soon after the first, a fog was seen below arising from the water, at length it reached the summit of the hill; the air seemed very raw and cold to the touch, and the instruments shewed as in the second observation. The barometer continued at 28.60 inches after the fog was gone off, but the thermometer rose two or three degrees. The last observation was made at low water mark, about half a mile from the bottom of the hill. Thomas Hutchins.\n\n\"The height of Hoy above low-water mark, according to these observations should be 249.93 fathoms, or as near as may be 500 yards, neglecting the correction for the difference that may be supposed in the temperature of the quicksilver at the two stations, the quantity of which is uncertain.\" S.
