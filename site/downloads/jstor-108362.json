  "text": "VIII. On a General Method in Analysis. By George Boole, Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S. &c.\n\nReceived January 12th.—Read January 18th.\n\nMuch attention has of late been paid to a method in analysis known as the calculus of operations, or as the method of the separation of symbols. Mr. Gregory, in his Examples of the Differential and Integral Calculus, and in various papers published in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, vols. i. and ii., has both clearly stated the principles on which the method is founded, and shown its utility by many ingenious and valuable applications. The names of M. Servois (Annales des Mathématiques, vol. v. p. 93), Mr. R. Murphy (Philosophical Transactions for 1837), Professor De Morgan, &c., should also be noticed in connection with the history of this branch of analysis. As I shall assume for granted the principles of the method, and shall have occasion to refer to various theorems established by their aid, it may be proper to make some general remarks on the subject by way of introduction.\n\nMr. Gregory lays down the fundamental principle of the method in these words: \"There are a number of theorems in ordinary algebra, which, though apparently proved to be true only for symbols representing numbers, admit of a much more extended application. Such theorems depend only on the laws of combination to which the symbols are subject, and are therefore true for all symbols, whatever their nature may be, which are subject to the same laws of combination.\" The laws of combination which have hitherto been recognised are the following, $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ being symbols of operation, $u$ and $v$ subjects.\n\n1. The commutative law, whose expression is\n\n$$\\pi \\varepsilon u = \\varepsilon \\pi u.$$\n\n2. The distributive law,\n\n$$\\pi (u + v) = \\pi u + \\pi v.$$\n\n3. The index law,\n\n$$\\pi^m \\pi^n u = \\pi^{m+n} u.$$\n\nPerhaps it might be worth while to consider whether the third law does not rather express a necessity of notation, arising from the use of general indices, than any property of the symbol $\\pi$.\n\nThe above laws are obviously satisfied when $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ are symbols of quantity. They are also satisfied when $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ represent such symbols as $\\frac{d}{dx}$, $\\Delta$, &c., in combination with each other, or with constant quantities. Thus,\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}(au) = a \\frac{du}{dx},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}(u+v) = \\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{dv}{dx}.\n\\]\n\nThese properties of the symbol \\( \\frac{d}{dx} \\), taken in connection with the principle above enunciated, lead to the most important results that have been yet established by the calculus of operations. We have an early example of their application in the symbolical form of Taylor's theorem, viz.\n\n\\[ f(x+h) = e^{\\frac{d}{dx}}f(x). \\]\n\nA result to which we shall often refer is the following. If we have a linear equation with constant coefficients of the form\n\n\\[ \\pi^n u + A_1 \\pi^{n-1} u + A_2 \\pi^{n-2} u \\ldots + A_n u = X, \\]\n\nwherein \\( \\pi \\) operates solely on \\( u \\), and is therefore commutative with respect to \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots \\), then\n\n\\[ u = \\{ \\pi^n + A_1 \\pi^{n-1} + A_2 \\pi^{n-2} \\ldots + A_n \\}^{-1} X \\]\n\\[ = N_1 (\\pi - a_1)^{-1} X + N_2 (\\pi - a_2)^{-1} X + \\ldots + \\text{&c.}, \\]\n\n\\( N_1, N_2, \\ldots, a_1, a_2, \\ldots \\) having the same values as in the resolution of the rational fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\xi^n + A_1 \\xi^{n-1} \\ldots + A_n} \\]\n\ninto a similar series of terms*.\n\nIt is obvious that the above method is of necessity limited in its application. It is only in linear equations with constant coefficients that the operative symbols combine in subjection to the law we have supposed. Accordingly it has been remarked, that the calculus of operations has tended rather to simplify the processes of analysis than to extend its power.\n\nThe object of this paper is to develope a method in analysis, which, while it operates with symbols apart from their subjects, and may thus be considered as a branch of the calculus of operations, is nevertheless free from the restrictions to which we have alluded. The linear equation with variable coefficients, whether in differentials or in finite differences, will be treated under the form\n\n\\[ f_0(\\pi) u + f_1(\\pi) \\xi u + f_2(\\pi) \\xi^2 u + \\ldots + \\text{&c.} = U, \\]\n\n\\( U \\) being a function of the independent variable \\( x \\), and \\( \\pi \\) and \\( \\xi \\) operative symbols, which combine in subjection to the law\n\n\\[ f(\\pi) \\xi^m u = \\xi^m f(\\pi + m) u, \\]\n\nand which, when the subject function \\( u \\) is unity, further satisfy the relation\n\n\\[ f(\\pi) \\xi^m = f(m) \\xi^m. \\]\n\nIt might be expected, à priori, that a theory of linear equations founded on such a\n\n---\n\n* Cambridge Mathematical Journal, vol. ii. p. 114, vol. iii. p. 289.\nbasis, would be of peculiar character. Its actual advantages I conceive to be the following:\n\n1. The necessary reductions, transformations and developments are effected, for the most part, by theorems, the expression of which is independent of the forms of $f_0(x)$, $f_1(x)$, &c.\n\n2. We are thus able to establish a perfectly general method for the solution of linear differential equations total and partial in series, and for the calculus of generating functions.\n\n3. The form of the analysis affords facilities, which are believed to be peculiar to itself, for the finite integration of linear equations, and for the classification of integrable forms.\n\nThe received theory of the solution of linear differential equations in series is given by Euler*. It consists in assuming $u = \\sum a_m x^m$, and determining by substitution the relation connecting the successive values of $a_m$, or as it is called, the scale of the equation. This method fails when, in seeking the first index of a development, we arrive at equal or imaginary values. I am not aware that any mathematician has shown how this failure is to be remedied. Now the method developed in this paper has no such cases of exception.\n\nThe theory of series and of generating functions has been successively discussed by Euler and Laplace. A full account of their researches is given in Lacroix's larger treatise on the Calculus, tom. iii., in the chapters Théorie des Suites and Théorie des Fonctions Génératrices. I class these investigations together, because, although their objects are distinct, their mathematical theories are virtually the same. Euler proposes to determine the generating function of a series, $\\sum u_m t^m$, when the coefficients are formed according to such a law as the following:\n\n$$u_m = \\frac{(am + b)(a_1 m + b_1) \\cdots}{(cm + e)(c_1 m + e_1) \\cdots} u_{m-1}.$$  \n\nHe shows that by successive differentiations and integrations, the factors $am + b$, $cm + e$... may be eliminated, and the problem finally reduced to the solution of a differential equation. Laplace†, considering the unknown quantity $u_x$ in an equation of differences as the general coefficient of the expansion of a function $u$, proposes to determine $u$, and then by expansion to obtain $u_x$. It is not necessary for us to consider here whether the theory of generating functions is of any importance to the solution of equations of differences. The discovery of the generating function of a series is in itself a problem both interesting and important. Those who have paid attention to the subject will, I think, admit that the theories by which Euler and Laplace have endeavoured to accomplish this object, labour under two defects, one arising from the tedious character of the process by which the differential equation is formed, the other from the difficulty of its integration. This does by no means derogate from the genius or the claims of those wonderful men;\n\n* Calc. Integ. vol. ii.  \n† Théorie des Probabilités.\nfor the value of every discovery is in some measure relative, and is to be measured by the state of contemporary science as well as by its abstract merit.\n\nThe advantages which the method of this paper is believed to possess as respects the theory of series, are the following:\n\n1. The law of the series being known, or the equation of differences given, the differential equation is known by inspection. The rule is absolutely general, whatever may be the forms of the coefficients.\n\n2. The form under which the differential equation is presented offers great facilities for its integration. Those facilities are chiefly owing to the circumstance, that the form of the equation permits us, as before remarked, to effect the requisite transformations by general theorems. That this form has a peculiar fitness for the processes of integration, is further shown by the circumstance, that the method of resolution which in the common theory leads to the solution of differential equations with constant coefficients, conducts us here to the solution of a large class of equations with variable coefficients.\n\nThe arrangement of the subjects treated in this paper will lead us to consider,—1st, linear differential equations; 2nd, the theory of series; 3rd, the theory of generating functions; 4th, the theory of equations of finite differences.\n\nA. Preliminary Theorems.\n\nProp. 1. Let $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ be distributive symbols which combine in subjection to the law\n\n$$\\varepsilon f(\\pi)u = \\lambda f(\\pi)\\varepsilon u, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (1.)$$\n\n$\\lambda$ being a functional symbol operating on $\\pi$, in such manner that $\\lambda f(\\pi) = f(\\phi(\\pi))$, it is required to expand $f(\\pi + \\varepsilon)$ in ascending powers of $\\varepsilon$.\n\nWe have\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\varepsilon f(\\pi)u &= \\lambda f(\\pi)\\varepsilon u, \\\\\n\\varepsilon^2 f(\\pi)u &= \\lambda^2 f(\\pi)\\varepsilon^2 u, \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n\\varepsilon^m f(\\pi)u &= \\lambda^m f(\\pi)\\varepsilon^m u\n\\end{align*} \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (2.)$$\n\nLet $\\pi + \\varepsilon = \\eta$, then $f(\\pi + \\varepsilon)u = f(\\eta)u$. Now, as $\\eta$ operates solely on $u$, it is commutative with respect to the constants in $f(\\eta)$, wherefore\n\n$$\\eta f(\\eta)u = f(\\eta)\\eta u.$$\n\nOr dropping the subject $u$, and writing $\\pi + \\varepsilon$ for $\\eta$,\n\n$$(\\pi + \\varepsilon)f(\\pi + \\varepsilon) = f(\\pi + \\varepsilon)(\\pi + \\varepsilon).$$\n\nLet $f(\\pi + \\varepsilon)u = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} f_m(\\pi)\\varepsilon^m u$, then, still supposing $u$ to be understood,\n\n$$(\\pi + \\varepsilon)f(\\pi + \\varepsilon) = \\pi \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} f_m(\\pi)\\varepsilon^m + \\varepsilon \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} f_m(\\pi)\\varepsilon^m,$$\n\n$$= \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\pi f_m(\\pi)\\varepsilon^m + \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\varepsilon f_m(\\pi)\\varepsilon^m,$$\n\n$$= \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\pi f_m(\\pi)\\varepsilon^m + \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda f_m(\\pi)\\varepsilon^{m+1} \\text{ by (2).}$$\nUnder the first $\\Sigma$ in the second member the coefficient of $\\xi^m$ is $\\pi f_m(\\pi)$, and under the second $\\Sigma$ the coefficient of $\\xi^m$ is $\\lambda f_{m-1}(\\pi)$, wherefore the aggregate coefficient of $\\xi^m$ in the expansion of $(\\pi + \\xi)f(\\pi + \\xi)$ is\n\n$$\\pi f_m(\\pi) + \\lambda f_{m-1}(\\pi). \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (3.)$$\n\nAgain, we have\n\n$$f(\\pi + \\xi)(\\pi + \\xi) = \\Sigma f_m(\\pi)\\xi^m(\\pi + \\xi),$$\n\n$$= \\Sigma f_m(\\pi)\\xi^m\\pi + \\Sigma f_m(\\pi)\\xi^{m+1},$$\n\n$$= \\Sigma f_m(\\pi)\\lambda^m\\pi\\xi^m + \\Sigma f_m(\\pi)\\xi^{m+1} \\text{ by } (2.),$$\n\nwherein the aggregate coefficient of $\\xi^m$ is\n\n$$f_m(\\pi)\\lambda^m\\pi + f_{m-1}(\\pi).$$\n\nEquating this expression with (3.), we have\n\n$$f_m(\\pi)\\lambda^m\\pi + f_{m-1}(\\pi) = \\pi f_m(\\pi) + \\lambda f_{m-1}(\\pi);$$\n\n$$\\therefore \\quad f_m(\\pi) = \\frac{\\lambda f_{m-1}(\\pi) - f_{m-1}(\\pi)}{\\lambda^m\\pi - \\pi};$$\n\nor separating the symbols,\n\n$$f_m(\\pi) = \\frac{(\\lambda - 1)f_{m-1}(\\pi)}{(\\lambda^m - 1)\\pi}, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (4.)$$\n\nwhich expresses the law of formation of the coefficients.\n\nThe first term $f_0(\\pi)$ is equal to $f(\\pi)$: this may be proved by induction from the particular cases of $(\\pi + \\xi)^2$, $(\\pi + \\xi)^3$, &c., but perhaps more rigidly thus. Let $k$ be a symbol such that $kf(\\pi) = f_0(\\pi)$. Then the first term of the expansion of $(\\pi + \\xi)f(\\pi + \\xi)$ is $k\\pi f(\\pi)$; but by (3.) this term is $\\pi kf(\\pi)$, therefore\n\n$$k\\pi f(\\pi) = \\pi kf(\\pi);$$\n\nwherefore $\\pi$ and $k$ are commutative. It is hence evident that $k$ can only operate as a constant multiplier, the value of which is independent of the form of $f(\\pi)$. Let $f(\\pi) = \\pi$, then, since $f(\\pi + \\xi) = \\pi + \\xi$, it is evident that $k = 1$, wherefore\n\n$$f_0(\\pi) = f(\\pi),$$\n\nand the expansion is completely determined.\n\nCor. If the symbols $\\pi$ and $\\xi$ combine according to the law\n\n$$\\xi f(\\pi)u = f(\\pi + \\Delta \\pi)\\xi u,$$\n\n$\\Delta \\pi$ being any constant increment, then\n\n$$f(\\pi + \\xi) = f(\\pi) + \\Delta f(\\pi)\\xi + \\Delta^2 f(\\pi)\\xi^2 + \\Delta^3 f(\\pi)\\xi^3, \\ldots \\ldots (I.)$$\n\nthe interpretation of $\\Delta \\pi$ being\n\n$$\\Delta \\pi f(\\pi) = \\frac{f(\\pi + \\Delta \\pi) - f(\\pi)}{\\Delta \\pi};$$\n\nFor $\\lambda f(\\pi) = f(\\pi + \\Delta \\pi)$. Hence $\\lambda^m\\pi = \\pi + m\\Delta \\pi$ and (4.) gives\n$$f_m(\\pi) = \\frac{f_{m-1}(\\pi + \\Delta \\pi) - f_{m-1}(\\pi)}{\\Delta \\pi},$$\n\nwhence the theorem is manifest.\n\nIf $\\Delta \\pi = -1$, we find\n\n$$f(\\pi + \\varepsilon) = f_0(\\pi) + f_1(\\pi) \\varepsilon + \\frac{1}{1!2!} f_2(\\pi) \\varepsilon^2 + \\&c.,$$\n\nwhere $f_0(\\pi) = f(\\pi)$, and in general $f_m(\\pi) = f_{m-1}(\\pi) - f_{m-1}(\\pi - 1)$.\n\nIf $\\Delta \\pi$ vanishes the symbols $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ are commutative, $\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta \\pi}$ becomes $\\frac{d}{dx}$, and (I.) is reduced to Taylor's theorem.\n\nProp. 2. If $\\varepsilon = \\phi(x) \\varepsilon_r \\frac{d}{dx}$ then $x$ and $\\varepsilon$ combine according to the law\n\n$$\\varepsilon f(x) u = f(x + r) \\varepsilon_u.$$\n\nFor writing $u_x$ in the place of $u$, we have\n\n$$\\varepsilon f(x) u_x = \\phi(x) \\varepsilon_r \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) u_x,$$\n\n$$= \\phi(x) f(x + r) u_x + r,$$\n\n$$= f(x + r) \\phi(x) \\varepsilon_r \\frac{d}{dx} u_x,$$\n\n$$= f(x + r) \\varepsilon_u.$$\n\nProp. 3. If $\\pi = \\frac{n \\phi(x) \\varepsilon_r \\frac{d}{dx} - x}{r}$ and $\\varepsilon = \\phi(x) \\varepsilon_r \\frac{d}{dx}$, then $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ combine according to the law\n\n$$\\varepsilon f(\\pi) u = f(\\pi - 1) \\varepsilon_u,$$\n\nwe have $f(\\pi) = f\\left(\\frac{nq - x}{r}\\right)$. Now $\\varepsilon$ combines with $x$ according to the law\n\n$$\\varepsilon f(x) u = f(x + r) \\varepsilon_u, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (5.)$$\n\nand $\\varepsilon$ combines with $\\varepsilon$ as if it were a mere symbol of quantity; hence\n\n$$\\varepsilon f\\left(\\frac{nq - x}{r}\\right) u = f\\left(\\frac{nq - (x + r)}{r}\\right) \\varepsilon_u \\text{ by Prop. 2},$$\n\n$$= f\\left(\\frac{nq - x}{r} - 1\\right) \\varepsilon_u,$$\n\n$$= f(\\pi - 1) \\varepsilon_u.$$\n\nThis result may also be proved by expanding $f\\left(\\frac{nq - x}{r}\\right)$ in ascending powers of $\\varepsilon$ by Prop. 1, and operating with $\\varepsilon$ on each term of the series.\n\nProp. 4. If $\\pi = \\frac{x \\varepsilon_r \\frac{d}{dx} - x}{r}$ and $\\varepsilon = x \\varepsilon_r \\frac{d}{dx}$, then $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ satisfy the following relations,\n\\[ f(\\pi) \\varepsilon^m u = \\varepsilon^m f(\\pi + m) u, \\quad \\ldots \\quad (II.) \\]\n\\[ f(\\pi) \\varepsilon^m = f(m) \\varepsilon^m, \\quad \\ldots \\quad (III.) \\]\n\nthe subject \\( u \\) becoming unity in the second of the above equations.\n\nFor in the last Prop. let \\( \\phi(x) = x \\), and \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( \\pi = \\frac{x e^{\\frac{d}{dx}} - x}{r} \\), \\( \\varepsilon = xe^{\\frac{d}{dx}} \\), and\n\n\\[ \\varepsilon f(\\pi) u = f(\\pi - 1) \\varepsilon u. \\]\n\nBy induction, \\( \\varepsilon^m f(\\pi) u = f(\\pi - m) \\varepsilon^m u; \\)\n\n\\[ \\therefore \\quad f(\\pi) \\varepsilon^m u = \\varepsilon^m f(\\pi + m) u, \\]\n\nwhich is the first of the proposed relations. Now \\( m \\) being a constant is commutative with \\( \\pi \\), wherefore expanding \\( f(\\pi + m) \\) in the second member by Taylor's theorem, in ascending powers of \\( \\pi \\), we have\n\n\\[ f(\\pi) \\varepsilon^m u = \\varepsilon^m \\{ f(m) u + f'(m) \\pi u + f''(m) \\frac{\\pi^2}{1!2!} u + &c. \\}. \\]\n\nFor \\( u \\) write \\( u_x \\), then\n\n\\[ \\pi u_x = \\frac{x e^{\\frac{d}{dx}} - x}{r} u_x, \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{x u_{x+r} - x u_x}{r}, \\]\n\nwhich vanishes if \\( u_x = 1 \\). In like manner \\( \\pi^2 u_x, \\pi^3 u_x, &c. \\) vanish under similar circumstances, wherefore\n\n\\[ f(\\pi) \\varepsilon^m (1) = \\varepsilon^m f(m)(1), \\]\n\\[ f(\\pi) \\varepsilon^m = f(m) \\varepsilon^m, \\]\n\nwhich is the second of the relations in question.\n\nProp. 5. The same values being attributed to \\( \\pi \\) and \\( \\varepsilon \\), we shall have\n\n\\[ \\pi (\\pi - 1) \\ldots (\\pi - n + 1) u = x(x + r) \\ldots (x + (n - 1)r) \\left( \\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta x} \\right)^n u, \\quad \\ldots \\quad (IV.) \\]\n\nwherein \\( \\Delta x = r \\).\n\nWe have\n\n\\[ \\pi = \\frac{\\ell - x}{r}, \\]\n\\[ \\therefore \\quad \\varepsilon^{-1} \\pi u = \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon^{-1} x}{r} u. \\]\n\nNow\n\n\\[ \\varepsilon^{-1} xu = \\left( xe^{\\frac{d}{dx}} \\right)^{-1} xu = \\varepsilon^{-r} \\frac{d}{dx} x^{-1} xu = \\varepsilon^{-r} \\frac{d}{dx} u, \\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[ \\varepsilon^{-1} \\pi u = \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon^{-r} \\frac{d}{dx}}{r} u, \\]\n\\[ \\therefore \\quad (\\varepsilon^{-1} \\pi)^n u = \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon^{-r} \\frac{d}{dx}}{r} \\right]^n u. \\]\n\nNow\n\n\\[ (\\varepsilon^{-1} \\pi)^2 u = \\varepsilon^{-1} \\pi \\varepsilon^{-1} \\pi u = \\varepsilon^{-2} (\\pi - 1) \\pi u = \\varepsilon^{-2} \\pi (\\pi - 1) u, \\]\nand by induction,\n\n\\[ (g^{-1}x)^n u = g^{-n}x(x-1)\\ldots(x-n+1)u, \\]\n\n\\[ \\therefore \\quad g^{-n}x(x-1)\\ldots(x-n+1)u = \\left\\{ \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon^r}{r} \\right\\}^n u, \\]\n\nwhence\n\n\\[ x(x-1)\\ldots(x-n+1)u = g^n \\left\\{ \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon^r}{r} \\right\\}^n u. \\]\n\nBut\n\n\\[ g^n = x(x+r)\\ldots(x+(n-1)r) \\varepsilon^{nr} \\frac{d}{dx}, \\]\n\nwherefore\n\n\\[ x(x-1)\\ldots(x-n+1)u = x(x+r)\\ldots(x+(n-1)r) \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon^r}{\\Delta x} - 1 \\right)^n u, \\]\n\n\\[ = x(x+r)\\ldots(x+(n-1)r) \\left( \\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta x} \\right)^n u. \\]\n\nScholium. In the values of \\( x \\) and \\( g \\) employed in the two last propositions, if we expand the exponential \\( \\varepsilon^r \\frac{d}{dx} \\), we find\n\n\\[ x = x \\left( \\frac{d}{dx} + \\frac{1}{1!2!} r \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{1!2!3!} r^2 \\frac{d^3}{dx^3} + \\&c. \\right), \\]\n\n\\[ g = x \\left( 1 + r \\frac{d}{dx} + \\frac{r^2}{1!2!} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\&c. \\right). \\]\n\nLet \\( r = 0 \\), then \\( x = x \\frac{d}{dx} \\), \\( g = x \\). Put \\( x = \\varepsilon^t \\), then \\( x = \\frac{d}{dt} \\), \\( g = \\varepsilon^t \\). For simplicity, let us represent \\( \\frac{d}{dt} \\) by \\( D \\), then by (II.), (III.), (IV.) the symbols \\( D \\) and \\( \\varepsilon^t \\) satisfy the following relations:\n\n\\[ f(D) \\varepsilon^m u = \\varepsilon^m f(D+m)u. \\quad \\text{(V.)} \\]\n\n\\[ f(D) \\varepsilon^m = f(m) \\varepsilon^m. \\quad \\text{(VI.)} \\]\n\n\\[ D(D-1)\\ldots(D-n+1)u = x^n \\left( \\frac{d}{dx} \\right)^n u. \\quad \\text{(VII.)} \\]\n\nThese are known relations. With a view to the maintenance of an unbroken analogy, it has, however, been thought better to deduce them from the properties of the more general system in \\( x \\) and \\( g \\), than to assume them as already proved.\n\nB. § 1. Theory of Linear Differential Equations.\n\nProp. 1. Every linear differential equation which can, with or without expansion of its coefficients, be placed in the form\n\n\\[ (a + bx + cx^2\\ldots) \\frac{d^n u}{dx^n} + (a' + b'x + c'x^2\\ldots) \\frac{d^{n-1} u}{dx^{n-1}} + \\&c. = X, \\]\n\nmay be reduced to the symbolical form\n\n\\[ f_0(D)u + f_1(D)\\varepsilon^t u + f_2(D)\\varepsilon^{2t} u + \\ldots = U, \\quad \\text{(VIII.)} \\]\n\nwherein \\( f_0, f_1, f_2\\ldots \\) are functional symbols, and \\( U \\) is a function of \\( \\varepsilon^t \\).\nFor multiplying by $x^n$, and considering first the expression $(a+bx+cx^2..)x^n\\frac{d^n u}{dx^n}$, let $x=\\varepsilon^\\delta$, we have\n\n$$(a+b\\varepsilon^\\delta+c\\varepsilon^{2\\delta}..)D(D-1)..(D-n+1)u,$$\n\n$$=aD(D-1)..(D-n+1)u,$$\n\n$$+b(D-1)(D-2)..(D-n)\\varepsilon^\\delta u,$$\n\n$$+c(D-2)(D-3)..(D-n-1)\\varepsilon^{2\\delta} u.$$\n\nIn like manner may every term in the first member of the original equation be reduced; also the second member, which is a function of $x$, will become a function of $\\varepsilon^\\delta$; the aggregate of these results will produce an equation of the form (VIII.).\n\nMore generally, let it be supposed that we have a system of linear differential equations, total or partial, the dependent variables being $u_1v_1..$ the independent variables $x_1x_2..$ whereof the second members of the equations are functions; if we assume $x_1=\\varepsilon^{\\delta_1}, x_2=\\varepsilon^{\\delta_2}..$ the transformed equations may be so written as to satisfy the following conditions.\n\n1st. Every term involving $u$ shall be of the form $\\varphi(D_1, D_2..)\\varepsilon^{\\delta_1+r_1\\delta_2}u$, and similarly for every term involving $v$.\n\n2nd.

This analogy extends to the fundamental theorem, which may be defined as a general relation connecting any linear differential equation, or system of linear differential equations, with a corresponding equation or system of equations in finite differences.\nB. § 2.

In the present instance, as \\( P \\) does not involve any arbitrary constants, and as the direct operation \\( (D)^i \\) cannot introduce any, it is evident that \\( L, M, N \\) are simply numerical coefficients.\n\nThe above expression for \\( (D)^iP \\) applying to every term of the second member of (10'), it is obvious that \\( f_n(D) \\varepsilon^{nd}AP \\) will be a linear function of \\( P, Q, R... \\), whose coefficients are of the general type \\( \\phi_n(D) \\varepsilon^{nd}A, \\phi_n(D) \\) denoting a rational and integral combination of \\( (D) \\). In like manner, \\( f_n(D) \\varepsilon^{nd}BQ \\) will be a linear function of \\( P, Q, R \\), the coefficients whereof will assume the form \\( \\psi_n(D) \\varepsilon^{nd}B \\). Wherefore the equation (10') will become\n\n\\[ A'P + B'Q + C'R... = 0, \\ldots \\] (11.)\n\nevery coefficient \\( A', B', &c. \\) being of the type\n\n\\[ \\Sigma \\{ \\phi_n(D) \\varepsilon^{nd}A \\} + \\Sigma \\{ \\psi_n(D) \\varepsilon^{nd}B \\} + &c.; \\]\n\nand it is to be remarked, that the terms in this expression which correspond to a particular value of \\( n \\), are derived from the term which answers to the same value of \\( n \\) in the primitive equation (8.).\n\nIn order to satisfy (11.) independently of the particular values of \\( P, Q, R \\), let us assume\n\n\\[ A' = 0, B' = 0, C' = 0. \\ldots \\] (12.)\n\nEach of these equations being of the general form above given, we shall have by the fundamental theorem,\n\n\\[ A = \\Sigma(a_m \\varepsilon^{md}), \\quad B = \\Sigma(b_m \\varepsilon^{md}), \\quad C = \\Sigma(c_m \\varepsilon^{md}), \\quad &c. \\]\n\nthe successive values of \\( a_m, b_m \\) being connected by a system of relations of the general form,\n\n\\[ \\Sigma(\\phi_n(m)a_{m-n}) + \\Sigma(\\psi_n(m)b_{m-n})... = 0. \\]\n\nTo find the lowest value or values of \\( m \\) in \\( a_m, b_m, &c. \\), we must assume \\( a_{m-1}, b_{m-1}, &c. \\) to vanish, whence the last equation gives\n\n\\[ \\phi_0(m)a_m + \\psi_0(m)b_m... = 0. \\]\nNow this is the type of the system of relations derived from the term $f_0(D)u$. But the equation $f_0(D)u = 0$ is satisfied by the assumption $u = AP + BQ...$, in which A, B., are constants, that is, by the assumption $u = a_0P + b_0Q..$, whence the lowest value of $m$ in $a_m b_m..$ is 0, and the system (12.) is universally satisfied.\n\nEx. 1. Let the primitive equation be $x^2 \\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} - ((a + b - 1)x + qx^2) \\frac{du}{dx} + (ab + cqx)u = 0$,\n\nPutting $x = e^t$, we have\n\n$$D(D - 1)u - (a + b - 1)Du - qe^tDu + (ab + cq)e^tu = 0.$$  \n\nNow $qe^tDu = q(D - 1)e^tu$ by (V.), hence we have\n\n$$\\{D(D - 1) - (a + b - 1)D + ab\\}u - (q(D - 1) - cq)e^tu = 0,$$\n\nor\n\n$$(D - a)(D - b)u - q(D - c - 1)e^tu = 0,$$\n\nwhich is the symbolical form of the equation, whence $u = \\Sigma u_m e^{mt}$, with the relation\n\n$$(m - a)(m - b)u_m - q(m - c - 1)u_{m-1} = 0,$$\n\nwhence\n\n$$u_m = \\frac{(m - c - 1)u_{m-1}}{(m - a)(m - b)}.$$\n\nThe equation $(m - a)(m - b) = 0$ gives $m = a$ or $b$, which are consequently the lowest indices of the development. If, therefore, we represent the arbitrary constants $u_a, u_b$ by A and B, we have\n\n$$u = A(x^a + q \\frac{a - c}{1(a - b + 1)} x^{a+1} + q^2 \\frac{(a - c)(a - c + 1)}{1.2(a - b + 1)(a - b + 2)} x^{a+2} + &c.)$$\n\n$$+ B(x^b + q \\frac{b - c}{1(b - a + 1)} x^{b+1} + q^2 \\frac{(b - c)(b - c + 1)}{1.2(b - a + 1)(b - a + 2)} x^{b+2} + &c.).$$\n\nEx. 2.

In some such instances they may be evaded by a linear transformation, and in all cases the difficulty will be placed in the true point of view,—no slight advantage of the method.\n\nThe theory of equations involving a second member is, mutatis mutandis, the same as explained in the preceding section.\n\nEx. 1. Let the equation be such, that, on assuming $x=\\varepsilon^{\\theta}$, we have\n\n$$ (D-a)(D-b)u + \\varphi(y, \\frac{d}{dy}, D)\\varepsilon^{\\theta}u = 0. $$\n\nHere, by the fundamental theorem,\n\n$$ u = \\sum u_m \\varepsilon^{mb} = \\sum u_m x^m, $$\n\n$$ (m-a)(m-b)u_m + \\varphi(y, \\frac{d}{dy}, m)u_{m-1} = 0. $$\n\nThe equation $(m-a)(m-b)=0$ gives $m=a, m=b$; and as arbitrary functions are to be written in the place of constants, we shall have\n\n$$ u = F_a(y)x^a + F_{a+1}(y)x^{a+1} + F_{(a+2)}(y)x^{a+2} \\ldots $$\n\n$$ + F_b(y)x^b + F_{b+1}(y)x^{b+1} + F_{b+2}(y)x^{b+2} \\ldots $$\n\nwhere $F_a(y), F_b(y)$ are arbitrary, and in general for the rest\n\n$$ F_m(y) = \\frac{\\varphi(y, \\frac{d}{dy}, m)}{(m-a)(m-b)}F_{m-1}(y). $$\n\nAs a particular example, let $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = f(y)\\frac{d^2u}{dy^2}$. Multiply by $x^2$, and putting $x=\\varepsilon^{\\theta}$,\n\n$$ D(D-1)u - f(y)\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}\\varepsilon^{2\\theta}u = 0. $$\n\n$$ \\therefore \\quad u = F_0(y) + \\frac{f(y)\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}F_0(y)}{1.2}x^2 + \\left\\{ \\frac{f(y)\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}}{1.2.3.4} \\right\\}^2 F_0(y)x^4 $$\n\n$$ + F_1(y)x + \\frac{f(y)\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}F_1(y)}{1.2.3}x^3 + \\left\\{ \\frac{f(y)\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}}{1.2.3.4.5} \\right\\}^2 F_1(y)x^5, $$\n\n$F_0(y)F_1(y)$ being arbitrary. As the operation, implied by the symbol $f(y)\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}$, can always be performed, the above solution is universally interpretable.\n\nIf $f(y)=a^2$, we get\n\n$$ u = F_0(y) + \\frac{a^2}{1.2}\\frac{d^2F_0(y)}{dy^2}x^2 + \\frac{a^4}{1.2.3.4}\\frac{d^4F_0(y)}{dy^4}x^4 $$\n\n$$ + F_1(y)x + \\frac{a^2}{1.2.3}\\frac{d^2F_1(y)}{dy^2}x^3 + \\frac{a^4}{1.2.3.4.5}\\frac{d^4F_1(y)}{dy^4}x^5 \\ldots $$\n\nPut $F_0(y)=\\varphi(y)+\\psi(y), F_1(y)=u(\\varphi'(y)-\\psi'(y))$, and substituting, we get\n\n$$ u = \\varphi(y+ax) + \\psi(y-ax), $$\n\nwhich verifies the solution.\nEx. 2. To integrate the equation \\( x^2 \\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + x \\frac{du}{dx} - f(y) \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = 0 \\).\n\nPutting \\( x = \\varepsilon^\\theta \\), we have\n\n\\[\nD^2 u - f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} \\varepsilon^{2\\theta} = 0. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (18.)\n\\]\n\nThe equation \\( D^2 u = 0 \\) gives \\( u = a + B\\theta \\), which we shall substitute in (18.), regarding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) as functions of \\( \\theta \\) and \\( y \\). This gives\n\n\\[\nD^2 A + \\theta D^2 B + 2DB - f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} (\\varepsilon^{2\\theta} A + \\theta \\varepsilon^{2\\theta} B) = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhence by the rule\n\n\\[\nD^2 A + 2DB - f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} \\varepsilon^{2\\theta} A = 0,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nD^2 B - f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} \\varepsilon^{2\\theta} B = 0,\n\\]\n\napplied to which, the fundamental theorem gives\n\n\\[\nA = \\sum a_m \\varepsilon^{m\\theta}, \\quad B = \\sum b_m \\varepsilon^{m\\theta},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nm^2 a_m + 2m b_m - f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} a_{m-2} = 0,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nm^2 b_m - f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} b_{m-2} = 0;\n\\]\n\nwhence writing \\( x \\) for \\( \\varepsilon^\\theta \\), and determining \\( a_m, b_m \\); observing also that \\( a_0, b_0 \\) will be arbitrary functions of \\( y \\), we have\n\n\\[\nu = \\varphi_0(y) + \\varphi_1(y)x + \\varphi_2(y)x^2 + &c.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ \\log x(\\psi_0(y) + \\psi_1(y)x + \\psi_2(y)x^2 + &c.),\n\\]\n\n\\( \\varphi_0(y), \\varphi_1(y) \\) being arbitrary, and the succeeding forms of \\( \\varphi_m(y), \\psi_m(y) \\) determined by the equations\n\n\\[\n\\varphi_m(y) = f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} m\\varphi_{m-2}(y) - 2\\psi_{m-2}(y)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\psi_m(y) = f(y) \\frac{d^2}{dy^2} \\psi_{m-2}(y).\n\\]\n\nEuler has exhibited in a series the integral of the equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 u}{dx dy} + \\frac{a}{x+y} \\left( \\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{du}{dy} \\right) + \\frac{b}{(x+y)^2} u = 0,\n\\]\n\nand on that result are founded many of the solutions of partial differential equations in Dr. Peacock's 'Examples.' We proceed to consider a somewhat more general equation, of which we shall give two distinct solutions.\n\nEx. 3. Given \\( \\frac{d^2 u}{dx dy} + f_1(x+y) \\frac{du}{dx} + f_2(x+y) \\frac{du}{dy} + f_3(x+y)u = 0 \\),\n\n\\( f_1, f_2, f_3 \\) denoting any functions whatever, to find \\( u \\).\n\nPut \\( x = s, x+y = t \\), then \\( \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{d}{ds} + \\frac{d}{dt}, \\frac{d}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\), and transforming, we have\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2u}{dsdt} + \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + f_1(t) \\frac{du}{ds} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{du}{dt} + f_3(t) u = 0.\n\\]\n\nMultiply by \\( s \\), and put \\( s = \\varepsilon t \\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{d}{dt} + f_1(t) \\right) Du + \\left( \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{d}{dt} + f_3(t) \\right) \\varepsilon^t u = 0;\n\\]\n\nwhence, by the fundamental theorem,\n\n\\[\nu = \\sum u_m \\varepsilon^{m\\varepsilon} = \\sum u_m x^m,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{d}{dt} + f_1(t) \\right) mu_m + \\left( \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{d}{dt} + f_3(t) \\right) u_{m-1} = 0.\n\\]\n\nHence, if for \\( u_m \\) we write \\( F_m(t) \\), the solution will assume the following form,\n\n\\[\nu = F_0(t) + F_1(t)x + F_2(t)x^2, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (19.)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( F_0(t) \\) is arbitrary, and in general\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} F_m(t) + f_1(t) F_m(t) = - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{d}{dt} + f_3(t) \\right) F_{m-1}(t)}{m},\n\\]\n\nwhence we have, as the law of derivation,\n\n\\[\nF_m(t) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\int f_1(t) dt \\int f_2(t) dt \\left( \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{d}{dt} + f_3(t) \\right) F_{m-1}(t) dt.\n\\]\n\nTo this we may add a precisely similar solution in ascending powers of \\( y \\), the two together constituting the complete integral.\n\nWe cannot, from the above, deduce Euler’s solution, because that solution is expressed in ascending powers of \\( t \\), and not of \\( x \\) or \\( y \\). If, however, for \\( f_1(t) \\), \\( f_2(t) \\), \\( f_3(t) \\) we substitute Euler’s forms of those functions, and make \\( t = \\varepsilon t \\), we shall obtain the result in question.\n\nThe general solution (19.) has been given in order to illustrate the fact before adverted to, that when \\( T_0 \\) of (17.) is not simply a function of \\( D \\), the derivation of the coefficients of the final series may involve operations which it is difficult to perform.\n\nWe shall now show how, by a linear transformation, the difficulty may be evaded.\n\nAssume \\( x - y = s \\), \\( x + y = t \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{d}{ds} \\frac{ds}{dx} + \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{dt}{dx} = \\frac{d}{ds} + \\frac{d}{dt},\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dy} = \\frac{d}{ds} \\frac{ds}{dy} + \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{dt}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dt} - \\frac{d}{ds},\n\\]\n\nand transforming the original equation, we find\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2u}{ds^2} - \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} - (f_1(t) - f_2(t)) \\frac{du}{ds} - (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{du}{dt} - f_3(t) u = 0.\n\\]\n\nMultiply by \\( s^2 \\) and make \\( s = \\varepsilon t \\), we have, on reduction,\n\n\\[\nD(D-1)u - (f_1(t) - f_2(t))(D-1)\\varepsilon^t u - \\left( \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{d}{dt} + f_3(t) \\right) \\varepsilon^t u = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhence, by the fundamental theorem,\n\\[ u = \\sum u_m \\varepsilon^m = \\sum u_m s^m, \\]\n\n\\[ m(m-1)u_m - (f_1(t) - f_2(t))(m-1)u_{m-1} - \\left( \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{d}{dt} + f_3(t) \\right) u_{m-2} = 0. \\quad (20.) \\]\n\nThe equation \\( m(m-1) = 0 \\) gives \\( m = 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\), whence \\( u_0 \\) and \\( u_1 \\) are arbitrary functions of \\( t \\), which we shall represent by \\( F_0(t), F_1(t) \\). The value of \\( u_m \\), which we shall similarly represent by \\( F_m(t) \\), is given by (20.), whence the complete integral will be\n\n\\[ u = F_0(t) - F_1(t)s + F_2(t)s^2 + F_3(t)s^3 \\ldots \\text{ad inf.}, \\]\n\nwherein \\( s = x - y, t = x + y, F_0(t), F_1(t) \\) are arbitrary, and in general\n\n\\[ F_m(t) = \\frac{(m-1)(f_1(t) - f_2(t))F_{m-1}(t) + \\left( \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + (f_1(t) + f_2(t)) \\frac{d}{dt} + f_3(t) \\right) F_{m-2}(t)}{m(m-1)}. \\]\n\nThe derivation of the coefficients is thus always possible.\n\nB. § 4.

Hence (27.) becomes\n\n\\[\nv + \\psi(D)\\varepsilon^rv = V,\n\\]\n\nwith the relations\n\n\\[\nu = P_r\\frac{\\varphi(D)}{\\psi(D)}v, \\quad \\dot{U} = P_r\\frac{\\varphi(D)}{\\psi(D)}V.\n\\]\n\nAs the above Proposition is of great importance in the solution of differential equations, we shall devote some attention to the circumstances which attend its application.\n\nThat the expression of \\(P_r\\frac{\\varphi(D)}{\\psi(D)}\\) may be finite, it is sufficient that for every elementary factor \\(\\chi(D)\\) occurring in the numerator, there should correspond a similar factor \\(\\chi(D \\pm ir)\\) in the denominator, \\(i\\) being an integer, and vice versa; for\n\n\\[\nP_r\\frac{\\chi(D)}{\\chi(D+ir)} = \\frac{\\chi(D)\\chi(D-r)\\chi(D-2r)\\ldots}{\\chi(D+ir)\\chi(D+(i-1)r)\\ldots}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{\\chi(D+ir)\\chi(D+(i-1)r)\\ldots\\chi(D+r)},\n\\]\n\nwhich is a finite expression. Again,\n\n\\[\nP_r\\frac{\\chi(D)}{\\chi(D-ir)} = \\frac{\\chi(D)\\chi(D-r)\\ldots}{\\chi(D-ir)\\chi(D-(i+1)r)\\ldots}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\chi(D)\\chi(D-r)\\ldots\\chi(D-(i-1)r),\n\\]\n\nwhich is also finite; the product of any number of such expressions is finite also.\n\nIf \\(\\chi(D)\\) is any elementary factor of \\(\\varphi(D)\\), it may be converted into \\(\\chi(D \\pm ir)\\); for let \\(\\varphi(D) = \\chi(D)\\chi'(D)\\), and let \\(\\psi(D) = \\chi(D \\pm ir)\\chi'(D)\\), wherein \\(\\chi'(D)\\) denotes the product of the remaining factors, then\n\n\\[\nP_r\\frac{\\varphi(D)}{\\psi(D)} = P_r\\frac{\\chi(D)}{\\chi(D \\pm ir)},\n\\]\n\nwhich is finite.\nIf $\\varphi(D)$ involves any factor of the form $\\frac{\\chi(D)}{\\chi(D \\pm ir)}$, it may be made to disappear; for let $\\varphi(D) = \\frac{\\chi(D)}{\\chi(D \\pm ir)}\\chi'(D)$, and let $\\psi(D) = \\chi'(D)$, then\n\n$$P_r^{\\varphi(D)} = P_r^{\\chi(D)}$$\n\nwhich is finite.\n\nFrom inspection of the above it is evident that if $\\varphi(D)$ is in the form of a rational fraction, and it is proposed to diminish (so to speak) $D$ in any factor of the numerator, or to augment $D$ in a factor of the denominator, by a multiple of $r$, the process by which $u$ will be finally deduced from $v$ will depend upon differentiation; but if it is proposed to augment $D$ in a factor of the numerator, or to diminish $D$ in a factor of the denominator, the process will involve integration. The former is obviously the preferable condition.\n\nThe general proposition (XIV.) amounts in reality to this, that the equation\n\n$$u + \\varphi(D)\\varepsilon^ru = U$$\n\nmay be resolved into the system of equations,\n\n$$u = P_r^{\\varphi(D)}v, \\quad U = P_r^{\\varphi(D)}V,$$\n\n$$v + \\psi(D)\\varepsilon^rv = V,$$\n\nwhence $V, v, u$ are to be successively determined. Of these equations we shall call the two first the auxiliary ones, and (31.) the transformed one. This premised, the following are the canons which regulate the determination of the constants.\n\n1. If no factor of $\\varphi(D)$ disappears in $\\psi(D)$, no arbitrary constants are to be introduced into the solutions of the auxiliary equations; those derived from the transformed equation being necessary and sufficient.\n\n2. Disappearing factors are in general of the form $\\frac{D+a}{D+b}$, $a-b$ being a multiple of $r$.\n\nEvery such factor will give a system of $\\frac{a-b}{r}$ constants in the solution of one of the auxiliary equations; if in that of the equation determining $V$, those constants will be arbitrary, but one only will need to be retained; if however in that of the equation determining $u$, one only will be arbitrary, and the rest will be therewith connected by the relation $u_m + \\varphi(m)u_{m-r} = 0$, derived from the primitive equation.\n\nThe reason why the constants connected with the disappearing factor are arbitrary in $V$ alone, is, that $V$ enters into no other equation than the one in whose solution those constants are found. If however the entire series of constants in $V$ are retained, they will be reduced to one by the subsequent differentiations in passing to the value of $u$.\n\nEx. 1. To determine the general characteristic of those differential equations of the $n$th degree, the solution of which depends on that of the equation $\\frac{d^n v}{dx^n} \\pm q^n v = X$.\nThe symbolical form of this equation is\n\n\\[ v \\pm \\frac{q^n}{D(D-1) \\ldots (D-n+1)} \\varepsilon^n v = V, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (32.) \\]\n\nwherein \\( V \\) is the symbolical form of \\( \\left( \\frac{d}{dx} \\right)^{-n} X \\), i.e. the result obtained by writing \\( \\varepsilon^n \\) for \\( x \\) in the \\( n \\)th integral of \\( X dx^n \\), no constants being added in the integration. From inspection of (32.), it is evident that the class of equations sought, must, on assuming \\( x = \\varepsilon^n \\), be reducible to the form\n\n\\[ u \\pm \\frac{q^n}{(D+a_1)(D+a_2) \\ldots (D+a_n)} \\varepsilon^n u = U, \\]\n\nin which we shall suppose the quantities \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n \\) to be ranged in the order of their magnitudes. Put \\( u = \\varepsilon^{-a_1} u \\), then by Prop. 2,\n\n\\[ u_1 \\pm \\frac{q^n}{D(D+a_2-a_1) \\ldots (D+a_n-a_1)} \\varepsilon^n u_1 = \\varepsilon^{a_1} U. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (33.) \\]\n\nThe first factor of the denominator of \\( \\varphi(D) \\) in (32.) now corresponds with the first factor of the denominator of \\( \\psi(D) \\) in (33.). In any of the remaining factors we may by Prop. 2 convert \\( D \\) into \\( D \\pm ir \\), \\( i \\) being any integer,—hence that they may all correspond with the factors of \\( \\psi(D) \\), we must have the quantities\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_2-a_1+1}{n}, \\quad \\frac{a_3-a_1+2}{n}, \\quad \\frac{a_4-a_1+3}{n}, \\ldots \\frac{a_n-a_1+n-1}{n}, \\]\n\nall negative integers, which are therefore the conditions sought.\n\nFrom (32.) and (33.), by (XIV.), \\( u_1 = P_n \\varphi(D) v \\),\n\nwherein \\( \\varphi(D) = \\pm \\frac{q^n}{D(D+a_2-a_1) \\ldots (D+a_n-a_1)} \\), \\( \\psi(D) = \\pm \\frac{q^n}{D(D-1) \\ldots (D-n+1)} \\);\n\nbut \\( u = \\varepsilon^{-a_1} u_1 \\), wherefore\n\n\\[ u = \\varepsilon^{-a_1} P_n \\frac{(D-1) \\ldots (D-n+1)}{(D+a_2-a_1) \\ldots (D+a_n-a_1)} v, \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (34.) \\]\n\nwhence the value of \\( u \\) will be deduced from that of \\( v \\) by differentiation; for since \\( a_2-a_1 < -1 \\),\n\n\\[ P_n \\frac{(D-1)}{(D+a_2-a_1)} = (D-1)(D-n-1) \\ldots (D+a_2-a_1+n), \\]\n\nand so on for the remaining factors to which \\( P_n \\) is to be applied.\n\nThe two following examples will sufficiently illustrate the preceding case.\n\nEx. 2.

Some Illustrations of a more General Method of Resolution.**\n\nWe have, in Propositions 2 and 3 of the last section, fully considered the theory of the differential equation \\( u + \\varphi(D) \\varepsilon^{\\alpha} u = U \\), and have exhibited in Prop. 1 a method of resolution by which a more extensive class of equations may be reduced to the preceding form. In what follows I purpose to exemplify a more general method of resolution, founded on the expansion of \\( f(\\pi + \\varepsilon) \\) in (I.). This method is deserving of particular attention for two reasons; first, because, in connexion with Propositions 2 and 3 already referred to, it enables us to integrate almost every class of linear differential equations that admits of integration in finite terms; and, secondly, because a strictly analogous method is applicable to equations of finite differences.\n\nI shall suppose the differential equation to be placed under the form\n\n\\[ f_0(D)u + f_1(D)\\varphi(D)\\varepsilon^{\\alpha} u + f_2(D)\\varphi(D)\\varphi(D-1)\\varepsilon^{2\\alpha} u \\ldots = U, \\]\n\nwhere \\( f_0(D), f_1(D), \\ldots \\) are any rational and entire functions of \\( D \\), and \\( \\varphi(D) \\) any function whatever of that symbol.\n\nLet \\( D - n\\varphi(D)\\varepsilon = \\pi \\) and \\( \\varphi(D)\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon \\), then by reasoning precisely similar to that of A, Prop. 3, it is seen that \\( \\pi \\) and \\( \\varepsilon \\) combine according to the law,\n\n\\[ \\varepsilon f(\\pi)u = f(\\pi-1)\\varepsilon u. \\]\n\nNow \\( \\varphi(D)\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon, \\varphi(D)\\varphi(D-1)\\varepsilon^{2\\alpha} = \\varepsilon^2, \\) and so on. Wherefore the proposed equation will assume the form\n\n\\[ f_0(D)u + f_1(D)\\varepsilon u + f_2(D)\\varepsilon^{2\\alpha} u + \\ldots = U. \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad (52.) \\]\n\nBut \\( D = \\pi + n\\varepsilon \\), wherefore, expanding the coefficients of the above equation by (I.), we have\n\n\\[ f_0(D) = f_0(\\pi) + n\\Delta_{\\pi} f_0(\\pi)\\varepsilon + \\frac{n^2}{1!2} \\Delta_{\\pi}^2 f_0(\\pi)\\varepsilon^2 + \\ldots \\]\n\nAnd similarly for the rest, the interpretation of \\( \\Delta_{\\pi} \\) being\n\n\\[ \\Delta_{\\pi} f(\\pi) = f(\\pi) - f(\\pi-1). \\]\nSubstituting the expanded forms of $f_0(D) f_1(D)$ &c. in (52.), we have a result which may be thus represented:\n\n$$\\varphi_0(\\pi)u + \\varphi_1(\\pi)\\varepsilon u + \\varphi_2(\\pi)\\varepsilon^2 u + \\&c. = U, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (XVI.)$$\n\n$\\varphi_0(\\pi), \\varphi_1(\\pi), \\&c.$ being rational and entire functions of $\\pi$. Several distinct cases may here occur, rendering the above equation either integrable, or reducible to a simple form.\n\n1st. It may happen that by a particular determination of $n$ the equation (XVI.) may be reduced to a single term. Suppose that it should give\n\n$$\\varphi_0(\\pi)u = U;$$\n\nthen if $\\pi - q_1, \\pi - q_2, \\&c.$ are the factors of $\\varphi_0(\\pi)$, we shall, by resolution, have\n\n$$u = N_1u_1 + N_2u_2 + N_3u_3 + \\&c.$$  \n\n$$(\\pi - q_1)u_1 = U$$  \n$$(\\pi - q_2)u_2 = U.$$  \n\nOn replacing $\\pi$ by its value, $D - n\\varphi(D)\\varepsilon^t$, the above system will assume the form\n\n$$u + \\varphi_1(D)\\varepsilon u = U,$$\n\nwhich has already been considered.\n\n2nd. The coefficients $\\varphi_0(\\pi), \\varphi_1(\\pi), \\&c.$ may be constant. The equation then becomes\n\n$$u + a_1\\varepsilon u + a_2\\varepsilon^2 u + \\&c. = U,$$\n\nwhich has been already considered.\n\n3rd. The equation (XVI.) may, perhaps, be reduced to consist of a pair of terms. Suppose that it should give\n\n$$\\varphi_0(\\pi)u + \\varphi_1(\\pi)\\varepsilon u = U;$$\n\nthis may be reduced to the general form\n\n$$u + \\varphi(\\pi)\\varepsilon u = U.$$\n\nAs $\\pi$ and $\\varepsilon$ combine according to the laws of $D$ and $\\varepsilon^t$, the above equation may be treated by Prop. 2 and 3, C. § 1, and its integrable cases determined accordingly.\n\nIn illustration of the above theory, we shall investigate the principal integrable cases of the equation\n\n$$(lx^2 + mx^3 + nx^4)\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + (l'x + m'x^2 + n'x^3)\\frac{du}{dx} + (l'' + m''x + n''x^2)u = 0.$$\n\nThe symbolical form of the above equation is\n\n$$\\{lD(D-1) + l'D + l''\\}u + \\{m(D-1)(D-2) + m'(D-1) + m''\\}\\varepsilon u$$\n\n$$+ \\{n(D-2)(D-3) + n'(D-2) + n''\\}\\varepsilon^2 u = 0;$$\n\nor, as it may be written,\n\n$$l(D+\\alpha)(D+\\beta)u + m(D+\\alpha')(D+\\beta')\\varepsilon u + n(D+\\alpha'')(D+\\beta'')\\varepsilon^2 u = 0, \\ldots \\quad (53.)$$\nwherein\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{v - l + \\sqrt{(v - l)^2 - 4ll'}}{2l}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{v - l - \\sqrt{(v - l)^2 - 4ll'}}{2l}, \\]\n\n\\[ \\alpha' = \\frac{m' - 3m + \\sqrt{(m' - m)^2 - 4mm'}}{2m}, \\quad \\beta' = \\frac{m' - 3m - \\sqrt{(m' - m)^2 - 4mm'}}{2m}, \\]\n\n\\[ \\alpha'' = \\frac{n' - 5n + \\sqrt{(n' - n)^2 - 4nn'}}{2n}, \\quad \\beta'' = \\frac{n' - 5n - \\sqrt{(n' - n)^2 - 4nn'}}{2n}. \\]\n\nIt may happen that some of the factors, \\(D + \\alpha\\), \\(D + \\beta\\), &c., are wanting.

Developing by this theorem the coefficients, and writing for \\( \\varepsilon^m u_x \\) its value \\( x(x-1)\\ldots(x-m+1)u_{x-m} \\), the required reversion will be effected.\n\n**F. § 2. On the Solution of Equations of Finite Differences in Series.**\n\nIn the equation\n\n\\[ f_0(\\pi)u_x + f_1(\\pi)\\varepsilon u_x + \\ldots + f_r(\\pi)\\varepsilon^r u_x = 0, \\]\n\nassume \\( u_x = \\sum u_m \\varepsilon^m \\) then precisely as in the case of differential equations,\n\n\\[ f_0(m)u_m + f_1(m)u_{m-1} + \\ldots + f_r(m)u_{m-r} = 0. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (\\text{XXIII}). \\]\n\nThe initial values of \\( m \\) are determined by the equation \\( f_0(m) = 0 \\). For every such value \\( u_m \\) is an arbitrary constant, for all other values it is successively determined by (XXIII.)\n\n**Ex. 1.** Given \\( (x-a)u_x - (2x-a-1)u_{x-1} + (1-q^2)(x-1)u_{x-2} = 0 \\).\n\nThe operation at length stands thus:\n\nMultiply by \\( x \\), we have\n\n\\[ x(x-a)u_x - (2x-a-1)xu_{x-1} + (1-q^2)x(x-1)u_{x-2} = 0. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (99). \\]\n\nOr\n\n\\[ x(x-a)u_x - (2x-a-1)\\varepsilon u_x + (1-q^2)\\varepsilon^2 u_x = 0. \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\quad (100). \\]\n\nNow developing the coefficients by (98.), we find\n\n\\[ x(x-a) = \\pi(\\pi-a) + (2\\pi-a-1)\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon^2, \\]\n\n\\[ 2x-a-1 = 2\\pi-a-1 + 2\\varepsilon, \\]\n\nwhence substituting in (100.)\n\n\\[ \\pi(\\pi-a)u_x - q^2\\varepsilon^2 u_x = 0, \\]\n\nwherefore \\( u = \\sum a_m \\varepsilon^m \\), with the relation\n\n\\[ m(m-a)a_m - q^2a_{m-2} = 0, \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ a_m = \\frac{q^2a_{m-2}}{m(m-a)}. \\]\n\nThe equation \\( m(m-a) = 0 \\) gives 0 and \\( a \\) for the lowest values of \\( m \\), wherefore, finally,\n\n\\[ u_x = C\\left(1 + \\frac{q^2x(x-1)}{2.2-a} + \\frac{q^4x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}{2.4(2-a)(4-a)} + \\ldots \\right), \\]\n\n\\[ + C_1\\left(x(x-1)\\ldots(x-a+1) + \\frac{q^2x(x-1)\\ldots(x-a-1)}{2(2+a)} + \\frac{q^4x(x-1)\\ldots(x-a-3)}{2.4(2+a)(4+a)} + \\ldots \\right). \\]\nWe have here two distinct series. Either of these is an integral of the equation (99.), but I apprehend that the second series only can be regarded as an integral of the original equation. The first series appears to have reference only to the irrelevant factor \\( x \\). As I am not aware that this distinction has been before observed, and as it appears to affect the validity of the canon which assigns to the integral of an equation of differences just so many arbitrary constants as there are units in the index of its order, I shall make no apology for adducing another illustration.\n\nLet us take the equation\n\n\\[\nxu_x = 0. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (101.)\n\\]\n\nWe find as the symbolical form,\n\n\\[\n(\\pi + \\xi)u_x = 0;\n\\]\n\nwhence \\( u_x = \\sum a_m x^m \\) with the relation \\( ma_m + a_{m-1} = 0 \\), or \\( a_m = -\\frac{a_{m-1}}{m} \\), the lowest value of \\( m \\) being 0, whence\n\n\\[\nu_x = C \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x(x-1)}{1.2} - \\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)}{1.2.3} + &c. \\right),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= C(1 - 1)^x,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= C0^x.\n\\]\n\nThis is obviously a true integral of (101.) for all values of \\( x \\) from 0 to \\( \\infty \\); for when \\( x = 0 \\) it gives \\( u_x = C \\), and when \\( x \\) is any positive quantity, \\( u_x = 0 \\), precisely as it ought to do. Moreover it involves an arbitrary constant \\( C \\); but (101.) being of the 0th order, there should, according to the received canon, be no arbitrary constant in its integral.\n\nFor the solution of the equation \\( x(x-1)u_x = 0 \\), we similarly find\n\n\\[\nu_x = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x(x-1) + a_3 x(x-1)(x-2) + &c.,\n\\]\n\nwherein \\( a_0, a_1 \\) are arbitrary constants, and in general\n\n\\[\na_m = -\\frac{2(m-1)a_{m-1} + a_{m-3}}{m(m-1)},\n\\]\n\nthis gives\n\n\\[\nu_x = a_0 + a_1 x - \\frac{2a_1 + a_0}{2} x(x-1) + \\frac{3a_1 - 2a_0}{6} x(x-1)(x-2) - &c.\n\\]\n\nFor the values \\( x = 0, x = 1 \\), the above series is reduced to an arbitrary constant; for all other positive values of \\( x \\) it vanishes. Here then we obtain for an equation of the 0th degree, a solution involving two arbitrary constants, and derived from the two irrelevant factors \\( x \\) and \\( x - 1 \\).\n\nIt would be interesting to inquire whether an equation of differences admits of integration by series when \\( f_0(m) \\) has equal or imaginary factors. After paying some attention to this question, I am disposed to think that such cases are not comprehended in any theory analogous to that which I have given for the corresponding class of differential equations.\n\nOn the subject of this section the reader may consult a paper by Mr. Bronwin in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, vol. iii.\nF. § 3. On the Solution of Equations of Differences in Finite Terms.\n\nWe have in the preceding section supposed \\( \\pi = x - xe^{-\\frac{d}{dx}} \\), \\( \\varepsilon = xe^{-\\frac{d}{dx}} \\), and have thus satisfied the relations (93.), (94.). We shall, in the following section, with greater generality assume (A. Prop. 3.),\n\n\\[ \\pi = x - n\\phi(x)\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{d}{dx}}, \\quad \\varepsilon = \\phi(x)\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{d}{dx}}. \\]\n\nThe condition (93.) will still be satisfied, and the expansion of \\( f(\\pi + \\varepsilon) \\) will remain unchanged.\n\nWe shall suppose the equation to be placed, as in all ordinary cases it may, under the form\n\n\\[ f_0(x)u_x + f_1(x)\\phi(x)u_{x-1} + f_2(x)\\phi(x)\\phi(x-1)u_{x-2} + \\&c. = U, \\ldots \\]  \n\n(102)\n\n\\( f_0(x), f_1(x), \\&c. \\) being rational and integral functions of \\( x \\), or at least susceptible of expansion in ascending powers of \\( x \\), and \\( \\phi(x) \\) any function whatever.\n\nSince \\( \\phi(x)\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{d}{dx}} = \\varepsilon \\), we have \\( \\phi(x)\\phi(x-1)\\varepsilon^{-2\\frac{d}{dx}} = \\varepsilon^2 \\), and so on; wherefore, writing \\( u \\) for \\( u_x \\), we have\n\n\\[ f_0(x)u + f_1(x)\\varepsilon u + f_2(x)\\varepsilon^2 u + \\&c. = U. \\]\n\nNow since \\( \\pi = x - ng \\), we have \\( x = \\pi + ng \\), and expanding the coefficients \\( f_0(x)f_1(x), \\&c. \\) by (I.), the equation will assume the form\n\n\\[ \\phi_0(\\pi)u + \\phi_1(\\pi)\\varepsilon u + \\phi_2(\\pi)\\varepsilon^2 u + \\&c. = U. \\ldots \\]  \n\n(XXIV.)\n\nThis equation is integrable in several cases:\n\n1st. If by any determination of \\( n \\) the equation should be reducible to a single term. Suppose that it should give\n\n\\[ \\phi_0(\\pi)u = U, \\ldots \\]  \n\n(103.)\n\nthen resolving \\( \\phi_0(\\pi) \\) into its factors, we shall have a system of equations each being of the form\n\n\\[ (\\pi - a)u = U; \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ (x - a)u_x - n\\phi(x)u_{x-1} = U, \\]\n\nwhich is completely integrable.\n\nThis method enables us to integrate all equations of the form (102.), in which\n\n\\[ f_m(x) = \\frac{h}{m}(f_{m-1}(x) - f_{m-1}(x-1)), \\ldots \\]  \n\n(104.)\n\n\\( h \\) being any constant. We should find \\( n = -h \\), \\( \\pi = x + h\\phi(x)\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{d}{dx}} \\), and \\( f_0(\\pi)u = U \\). I am not aware that this general class of equations has been considered before. A method of integrating equations of the form\n\n\\[ x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n+1)\\Delta^n u_{x-n} + a_1x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n+2)\\Delta^{n-1}u_{x-n+1} + \\&c. = 0, \\]\n\nwas communicated to me by Mr. Gregory*. In reality however they constitute a particular case of the above, the value of \\( \\pi \\) being \\( x - xe^{-\\frac{d}{dx}} \\).\n\n* Late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and author of the well-known \"Examples.\" Few in so short a life have done so much for science.

If the coefficients $\\varphi_0(\\pi), \\varphi_1(\\pi), \\&c.$ are constant quantities. This happens in the well-known class of equations\n\n$$u_x + a_1\\varphi(x)u_{x-1} + a_2\\varphi(x)\\varphi(x-1)u_{x-2} + \\&c. = U,$$\n\nwhich becomes\n\n$$(1 + a_1\\varphi + a_2\\varphi^2 + \\&c.)u_x = U,$$\n\nand is integrable by resolution of the operating factor, as in equations with constant coefficients. It may be worth while to note that this class of equations, when of the $n$th degree, involves one arbitrary function $\\varphi(x)$, and $n$ arbitrary constants, $a_1\\ldots a_n$; but the preceding class under the same circumstances involves one arbitrary function with $n+1$ arbitrary constants, viz. $h$ with $n$ constants in $f_0(x)$. It is therefore the more general of the two.\n\n3rd. If the equation should consist of only two terms.

If \\( f_0(D) \\) involves a pair of factors such as \\( \\phi(D), \\phi(D+r) \\), \\( r \\) being a multiple of the common difference of the values of \\( m \\), we must in the equation of \\( f_0(D)u = 0 \\) write \\( \\{\\phi(D)\\}^2 \\) in place of \\( \\phi(D)\\phi(D+r) \\), and similarly when there are more such factors. Thus, in the equation \\( D(D+2)u - q^2z^2u = 0 \\), the form of the assumption for \\( u \\) will be determined by the equation \\( D^2u = 0 \\), and not by \\( D(D+r)u = 0 \\). A slight change of expression would make the rule as general as the principle on which it is founded, and reduce to its dominion every case in which a linear differential equation can be integrated by ascending or descending developments. The theory of series infinite in both directions still remains to be examined.\n\nFearful of extending this paper beyond its due limits, I have abstained from introducing any researches not essential to the development of that general method in analysis which it was proposed to exhibit. It may however be remarked that the principles on which the method is founded have a much wider range. They may be applied to the solution of functional equations, to the theory of expansions, and, to a certain extent, to the integration of non-linear differential equations. The position which I am most anxious to establish is, that any great advance in the higher analysis must be sought for by an increased attention to the laws of the combinations of symbols. The value of this principle can scarcely be overrated; and I only regret that in the absence of books, and under circumstances unfavourable for mathematical investigation, I have not been able to do that justice to it in this essay which its importance demands.\n\nLincoln, August 31, 1844.",
