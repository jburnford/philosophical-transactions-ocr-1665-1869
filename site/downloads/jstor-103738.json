No. 382.\n\nF.1 Friday Oct. 11th at 7 in the Evening.\n\nF.2 Sunday Oct. 13th at 6 ditti\n\nF.3 Tuesday Oct. 15th at 6 ditti\n\nSupposing the Moon to be of this Diameter, the Comet Seem'd to me to be in proportion to this Circle; as above delineated.\n\nFig. 4\n\nFig. 5\n\nFig. 6\nII. Extract of a Letter from the Right Honourable\nthe Lord Paisley, F. R. S. to Mr. George\nGraham, F. R. S. With some curious Figures\nof the same Comet.\n\nHis Lordship being at Witham in Essex, where\nhe had the Advantage of a very clear Sky,\nfirst discover'd this Comet on Friday the 11th of Octob.\nlast about 7 in the Evening; it then appeared not\nmuch unlike a Star of between the 4th and 5th Mag-\nnitudes, but a Haziness round the Head, and some\nLight streaming from it on that Side that was oppo-\nsite to the Sun, induced him immediately to look\nupon it as a small Comet; which his Observation\nthe next Evening abundantly satisfy'd him of. His\nLordship was very particular in the Notice he took\nof its Appearance, and was pleased to communicate\nthe three curious annexed Figures [Fig. 1, 2, 3.] of it,\nrepresenting it on three several Nights, viz. the 11th,\n13th and 15th of the same Month; some time after\nwhich the Tail became so inconsiderable as hardly\nto deserve any farther Description; as will be readily\njudged from the Decrease of it between the 11th and\n15th Days of the Month. The Tail was visible on\nthe 11th to near a Degrees Distance from the Body,\nas his Lordship found by comparing it with some\nknown Distances in the Heavens; it was of a dusky\nLight not unlike a Cloud growing darker and darker to-\nwards its Extremity, as is express'd in the first Figure,\nwhere, as well as in the two following, the white\nSpeck in the Head is intended to express the Bright-\nness\nnefs of a small Star; from the Comparison of which with the Tail the Brightness of the latter may in some sort be collected: The Tail appear'd sharper, and not so much spread in the two following Observations, and in the last did not exceed one third Part of the first Length; it was then of a much darker Colour, which made the Difference between that and the Head more observable, the Head yet appearing sufficiently bright. For some following Nights his Lordship's Observations were interrupted by cloudy Weather, after which the Comet was so far diminish'd, as only to be known by its Motion, its Appearance being no ways distinguishable from that of a small nebulose Star.\n\nIII.

Rei novitate perscrutatus, eo Telescopium direxi, statimque Cometæ esse deprehendi; siquidem tenuissimæ nebulæ globus apparuit, ejusque in medio veluti lucidus nucleolus.
