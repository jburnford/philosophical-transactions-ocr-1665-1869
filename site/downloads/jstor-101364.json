And if this separation be made in the Spring or Summer, the Bees will like their new house the better that it hath been used before.\n\nWhat else is to be done, as to the right ordering and management of Bees, is to be learnt from the Authors that write of it, and from persons that are best experienced in it.\n\nAn Account of the Experiments promised at the end of the next precedent Transactions, concerning the wonderful Effects of the Blood-staunching liquor upon a Man and a Woman in St. Thomas's Hospital in South-wark London.\n\nThe King having in his presence caused some considerable Experiments to be made with the new Blood-stopping liquor upon Brutes, and there remaining yet some persons here doubting, whether it would as well succeed upon Men; his Majesty gave order to his Chirurgions to go and see in the Hospitals, whether there were not some wounded persons whose blood had need to be stopp'd. Hereupon there were found two very fit Patients in the Hospital of St. Thomas. The first was a Woman labouring under an inveterate Scurvy and the King's Evil, whose Leg was to be cut off, because of a malignant ulcer, not suffering her to sleep day or night. The other was a Seaman, whose Leg was also to be cut off, because of a wound accompanied with a fracture made by a cannon-bullet in the last Sea-fight.\n\nThe first Experiment then was made July 3, the King having sent some of his Physicians and Chirurgions to the said Hospital to be present at the operation, and faithfully to report to his Majesty what should pass there. The Leg therefore of the poor Woman being cut off, immediately the Arteries were dress'd with some linnen pledgets dipt in the Astringent liquor with a compress upon it, and a bandage keeping all close against the arteries. The success was, that the blood was staunch without any other dressing; and instead of complaining, as those are wont to do who have a limb cut off, and the mouths of whose arteries are burnt with an hot Iron or a caustique to stop the blood, this Patient look'd very cheerful, and was free from pain, and slept two hours after, and also the night following\nlowing; and from that time hath found herself still better and better, without any return of bleeding, or any ill accident.\n\nThe 4th of July the leg of the Seaman was cut off, and after the part was dressed as above with linen dipp'd in the Essence, the blood was stopp'd in less than half a quarter of an hour. There was made a bandage, that pressed the linen against the cut arteries; and without any other thing the Patient found himself so eas'd of the pains he felt before, that he slept two or three hours after, and all the night following.\n\nNext morning the dressings of the Woman as well as the Man were taken off in the presence of the same persons, and all the Physicians and Chirurgions there present did acknowledge, that no wounds could look more fair and ruddy; there appearing no escarr at all, nor any more blood than if there had never been any veins or arteries open'd in that part.\n\nThese two Patients have found themselves very well ever since the operation; and forasmuch as no ill accident hath befallen them since, they have served to convince the most incredulous of the goodness of this remedy.\n\nThe King easily concluding from these and the former Experiments, how useful this medicine would be in his Armies and Fleets, and understanding, that those who before opposed it, did now highly praise it, gave order, that Monsieur Denis should be desired to communicate the secret of it; which being done, his Majesty commanded a quantity of it to be made in his own Laboratory, of which tryals were made upon three Calves in Whitehall the 12th of July; a leg of each of them having been cut off, as high as was possible, and the blood of them stopp'd with this new liquor to the admiration of all the Spectators. For this Water having been prepar'd with more exactness than ever, the effect of it was so quick and effectual, that the blood was stopp'd in four minutes of time, the Calves by their motion making the pledgets to falloff, that had been put on the parts cut, and not a drop of blood appearing.\n\nThe King hereupon caused the quantities that had been thus prepared, which were very considerable, to be immediately dispatch't away to his Majesties Fleet; and 'tis not doubted, but that upon occasion all that shall happen to be wounded will receive great relief and benefit thereby.\n\nPARAL.",
