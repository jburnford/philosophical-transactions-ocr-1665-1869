S. and at Upminster in England, observed at the same time by Mr. W. Derham, F. R. S. as also the Rain at Pisa in Italy in 1707. and 1708. observed there by Dr. Michael Angelo Tilli, F. R. S. and at Zurich in 1708. and at Upminster in all that time: With Remarks on the same Tables, as also on the Winds, Heat and Cold, and divers other Matters occurring in those three different Parts of Europe. By Mr. W. Derham, Rector of Upminster.\n\nIT being the Pleasure of our most illustrious Society, to put into my hands (according to Dr. Scheuchzer's desire) his Observations of the Weather, &c. made at Zurich in the Year 1708. and having also myself received from Dr. Mich. Angelo Tilli the quantity of Rain which he observed to fall at Pisa; I have accordingly compared these Observations with mine made at the same time at Upminster. And to represent them the better at an easy view, I have put what I could of them into the annexed Tables. In the former of which, I have represented Dr. Scheuchzer's and my Barometrical Observations: In the latter, his Rain Observations, those of Dr. M. A. Tilli, and mine own; all reduced to the same, that is, our English measure, that they may the more easily be seen and compared together. But because I am not as yet cer-\ncertain of the true Proportion between the Tuscan and English weight, I have therefore given Dr. M. A. Tilli's Rain, both in the Tuscan Pounds and Ounces as he sent it me; as also reduced to our English Troy-pound and Centesimal of that Pound, according to Mr. Greaves's proportion, which is different from that assigned by Sir Jonas Moor.\n\nAs to Dr. Scheuchzer's other Observations of the Winds, the Weather, the Thermometer, and divers other very curious and remarkable Matters, I have not inserted them into particular Tables, because these following general Remarks may in some measure supply that defect.\n\nI. For the Thermometer. It would have been in vain to have compared his Observations with mine, by reason we have not yet a Standard for Thermometers, as we have for the Barometers; they being everywhere in all, or most respects different; some with large, some with small Bottles of Spirits; some accordingly with longer, some with shorter; some with wider, some with narrower Canes, or Shanks; some filled with more highly rectify'd, and consequently more expansive Spirits, some with more phlegmatick and duller Spirits.\n\nThe difference particularly between Dr. Scheuchzer's and my Thermometer is, his is about one Foot long; that I observed with all along (till it was broken this Year) about two Feet and a half; and that I now observe with, three Feet and a quarter; the bore of the Stalk is small, and the Ball is large, and consequently the Rang great, answering every the least alteration of Heat and Cold.\n\nBut yet thus much I have been able to observe by comparing Dr. Scheuchzer's and my Thermometrical Observations, viz. That notwithstanding the Alpine Snows have mighty Effects on the Weather in Switzerland, and other conterminous Places, yet there is much more agreement between the Heats and Cold at Zurich and Upenster, than\nthan before comparing them, I imagined. (I speak with relation to last Year only, having no other Observations.) For in Winter, although I imagine we have more warm days than they; and in Summer, that they have greater Heats than we; yet I observe that the Colds and Heats in both Places, begin and end nearly about the same time: Yea, that oftentimes any remarkable Weather (especially if of somewhat long continuance) affecteth one as well as the other place. Thus for instance, June, which was (some part of it at least, particularly the very day after the Solstitial-day, June 12.) remarkably Cold in England, seems to have been not very different at Zurich; Dr. Schenckzer's Thermometer divers times that Month (though not on the very same days perhaps) descending as low, or rather lower than in the Month before, yea as low as many days in the Winter Months. But one thing I farther observed was, that all this Month their cold Weather constantly preceded ours here about five or more Days. An Indication that (as shall be farther observed hereafter) the Weather in both Places was influenced by the same Causes, whether the Alpine Hills and Cold, or the Influx of the Moon and other heavenly Bodies, or any other Cause, I shall not enquire.\n\nAnd as in June there was a great agreement in the unusual Cold, so in August there was not much less agreement in Heat; the Heats in both places being great, and beginning to abate about the same time, only a little sooner here than there.\n\nIn Winter also, although, as I said, I imagine we have a greater number of warmer Days than they, yet I find that a warm Winter Month there is so here; and a cold one there is a cold one here likewise. Thus in February and March, October and November, a great agreement seems to have been between the Heats and Colds of both Places, some Days excepted. But January was at the beginning not so constantly Cold, for the Season, at Westminster, as\nit seems to have been at Zurich. And December last, which from the 8th Day to Christmas-day, was here moderate and open Weather, and after that more intensely Cold than even in the Long-Frost Anno 1683, by the fewer Thermometrical Observations which Dr. Scheuchzer made then, than in other Months, the greatest part, I say, of that Month seems to have been intensely cold at Zurich, as the later part thereof was with us remarkably in England.\n\nThus much for the Thermometrical Observations. The\n\nII. Remark I shall make, shall be of the Winds: Which also I did not enter into Tables, because it may be sufficient to observe in general, That although many Days they agree in both places, yet there are many more in which they differ. When they do agree, I find it is chiefly when the Winds are strong, and of long continuance; And more I think when Northerly and Easterly, than in the other Points. Also I have observed, That a strong Wind in one place hath been a weak one in the other.\n\nIII. As to the Barometrical Observations, I have thought it worth while to specify them. Mine own Observations I selected which were made at Noon; and Dr. Scheuchzer's as near Noon as might be. For which reason I commonly took his Morning Observations, because made for the most part about 10 or 11 of Clock. Also I took those made with his Bent Barometer; because they seemed to me (especially at the beginning of the Year) to be the most accurate.\n\nThe Altitudes of his Mercury he measureth by the Paris foot, which I have reduced to our English measure, that they may be at an easy view compared with mine:\nFor which reason I have also all along noted their Differences.\n\nIt is manifest from the Tables, That throughout the whole Year, the Mercury was lower at Zurich than at Upminster, by sometimes one, sometimes above two Inches English. The most remarkable difference was at the latter end of September and beginning of October, when the difference was for a good while above two Inches English. The reason of which, I guess, was because at Zurich I imagine the Air was more inclined to wet, at that time, than at Upminster; as also because the Winds then were Northerly and Easterly with us; which, 'tis well known, do make our Barometers rise, even in wet Weather. But the mean difference between Dr. Schenitzer's and my Barometers, I take to be about half an Inch English. From whence I conclude, That the Situation of Zurich is near a Quarter of an English Mile higher than that of Upminster above the surface of the Sea; or else that that part of the Terraqueous Globe, lying nearer the Line, is (according to the received Opinion) higher, or farther distant from the Center, than ours is, lying nearer the Pole.\n\nFarther. It may be observed from the annexed Barometrical Tables, That (as near the Equinoctial the Barometer is observed to stand nearly at a stay, but the more Northerly the Latitude, the greater the range of the Mercury, so) at Zurich the difference (last Year) was not so great between the highest and lowest stations of the y, as it was either at Paris or Upminster. For at Zurich the difference was only one Inch Paris-measure; at Paris Dr. Schenitzer says it was one Inch two Lines and an half; but at Upminster it was 1.8 Inch, (and some Years 'tis more) which is greater than either of them.\n\nThe last thing which I shall take notice of relating to our Barometrical Observations is, That I observe although there\nthere be some, and that a pretty deal of agreement between the rising and falling of our Barometers, one being very often high or low, when the other is so; and one oftentimes rising or falling when the other doth so; and one rising much or little, or falling much or little when the other doth: I say although the matter is often thus, yet it is not so certainly so, as it is nearer home. In our Philos. Trans. N. 286. I have given a Table of some Heights of the Mercury observed at Upminster, and at 200 Miles distance in Lancashire at the same time. And in the Hist. de l'Acad. Roy. des Scien. Anno 1699. Monsieur Meraldi, by comparing his Observations at the Paris Observatory with mine at Upminster, takes notice, \"That there is a great agreement between the variation of the Heights of the Barometers in both Places; that he finds almost always that when one riseth or falleth, the other doth so too, although not always alike: That the Days in each Month whereon the Mercury hath been highest or lowest, it hath been the same at Paris as at Upminster, but ordinarily somewhat more than 3 or 4 Lines lower at Paris than Upminster.\" But the Agreement between the Variations of Dr. Scheuchzer's Barometers and mine, although I say often great, yet is not so constantly, nor so certainly great as nearer home, viz. at London, Lancashire, Paris, and other places, with which I have made the comparison.\n\nIV. The next Remark I shall make, shall be on the Tables of Rain, observed at Pisa in Italy, by Dr. Mich. Angelo Tilli, Botannick Professor there; and at Zurich in Switzerland, by Dr. J. J. Scheuchzer; both very ingenious, curious, and diligent Members of this learned and honourable Society; and lastly, by myself at Upminster in Essex. The Italian Observations were procured\nfor me by the Society, as well as my illustrious Friend, Dr. Newton, Her Majesties very ingenious and learned Envoy at Florence, and a very useful Member of this Society.\n\n1. The first thing that in these Rain-Tables represents itself to our view, is, That the Rains for the most part are more frequent at Upminster than either at Zurich or Pisa; I mean We have more Rainy Days than They. But yet\n\n2. The Rains in both these Places are much greater in Quantity, in the whole Year, and in some Months, especially the Autumnal and Winter Months, than our Rains are at Upminster. May, June, and July, and a great part of August in 1707, seem to have been very dry, and I suppose searching Months at Pisa, as in some measure some of them were here: And in that time less Rain fell there than here. But the following Autumnal Months made, at Pisa, sufficient amends, either by the great quantity that fell at a time, I suppose in Thunder, and such like hasty large Showers; or else by the Quantity and Frequency both. What a prodigious Quantity was that, for instance, of above 32 pounds on August 19? (if it all fell on that, and not some on the preceding days.) But we find very large Quantities at a time to have fallen on divers Days, where it is manifest the Rain was weighed every Day, viz. 10 Pound, 9 Pound, and other large Quantities for several Days together, in the cooler autumnal Months. But as the Weather growth warmer, I imagine their Rains at Pisa are fewer; and what falleth, falleth in large quantities. For which reason the quantity of Rain in the Spring-months of March, April, and May 1708. (oftentimes dripping Months in England) is nearly the same both at Pisa and Upminster.\nAs to the Rain at Zurich, I observe, That although their Rains are less frequent than ours in Essex, yet they seem to be more frequent than theirs at Pisa: but the quantity at Zurich is greater than at Upminster, and less than at Pisa.\n\n'Tis Dr. Scheuchzer's Opinion, \"That more Rain falleth in Switzerland than in France, at Zurich than at Paris.\" To confirm which he giveth us this Table of eight Years Rain at Paris, to which I shall add mine for Upminster.\n\n| The Year | Depth in Lines of Paris measure | Depth in Inches of Paris measure | Depth in English Inches & Centel | At Upminster Depth in English Inches and Centesimal |\n|----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 1699     | 224                             | 18 8 1/4                         | 19 93                           | 15 11                                             |\n| 1700     | 240                             | 20 1/2                           | 21 37                           | 19 03                                             |\n| 1701     | 256                             | 21 4 1/4                         | 22 77                           | 18 63                                             |\n| 1702     | 196                             | 16 4 1/4                         | 17 45                           | 20 38                                             |\n| 1703     | 208                             | 17 4 1/4                         | 18 51                           | 23 99                                             |\n| 1704     | 238                             | 19 10 1/2                        | 21 20                           | 15 80                                             |\n| 1705     | 166                             | 13 10 1/4                        | 14 82                           | 16 93                                             |\n| 1706     | 183                             | 15 3 1/4                         | 16 31                           | 24 29                                             |\n| **Total Depth** | **142 10 1/2**                  | **152 36**                       |                                 | **154 22**                                       |\n\nIt is manifest from this Table, That the Zurich Rain last Year (although it amounted not to the Quantity which fell at Pisa in a whole Year, yet) exceeded both the Paris and Upminster annual Rains of 8 Years before. But whether it constantly doth so or not, if God spare them Life, the future Observations which Dr. Scheuchzer and Dr. Tilli promise us will demonstrate.\n\nBut before I quit my Remarks on this last Table, 'tis necessary that I take notice, That there is a greater difference\nrence between these last 8 Years Rain at Paris and Upminster, than I found in the 8 Years, in which I formerly compared the Rain of Towneley, Paris, Lisle, and Upminster together, in Philos. Trans. N. 297. For by that comparison it appeared, that less Rain fell at Upminster, than at either of the other three Places. But according to these later 8 Years in the Table, a small matter more falleth at Upminster than at Paris. For the mean Proportion for Paris (which according to former Years was above 20 Inches Paris measure, or 22 Inches English) is according to these last 8 Years no more than 17 Inches, 9 Lines, Paris-measure, or 19 Inches English: And Upminster-Rain, which I formerly computed at, Year for Year, about 20 Inches and an half English, is for these 8 Years much the same, or a little more than that at Paris.\n\nThe Proportions therefore which I shall now lay down for the yearly Rain of all Places, whose Rain I have had information of, are these; for Zurich (till farther Observations are made) 32 ½ Inches; for Pisa (till farther Observations also) 43 ¼ Inches; for Paris, 19 Inches; for Lisle, 4 Inches; for Towneley in Lancashire 42 ½ Inches; for Upminster 19 ¼ Inches; all the same, that is English-measure.\n\n3. The last Observation I shall make upon the Rain Tables is, The great use of Cold to the making of Rain. That Exhalations and Vapours are the matter of Rain, is not to be doubted. And how they are raised, whether according to the learned and ingenious Dr. Woodward's, or any other Hypothesis, I shall not enquire. It is sufficient for my present purpose to say, That when those Vapours are raised, they are constipated and condensed into Clouds and Rain, chiefly by the Cold of the Air to which they are elevated. And the greater the quantity of Vapours raised is, and withal the more intense the Cold of those airy Regions, the greater is the quantity of\nof Rain. This although probably a matter well known and scarce doubted, yet may deserve special Consideration, because it will lead me to divers observables. Now this is manifest from the annexed Tables compared with Dr. Scheuchzer's and my Weather, &c. Observations. Thus for instance January, which Dr. Scheuchzer frequently observed was sometimes warm, sometimes cold, and appeareth farther to have been so by his Thermometrical Column, and which was the same with us in South-Britain, that Month, I say, had plenty of Rain at Zurich, Upminster, yea, and Pisa too. The same might be said of February for Zurich, and probably Pisa too. So also for December in 1707. at Pisa and Upminster; and December last at Zurich and Upminster. But with us February was for the most part a cold Month, and the Rain the less, by reason the Vapours either could not be raised in plenty enough, or not be carried high enough, or suspended long enough to be united, but soon were precipitated back again to the earth.\n\nFrom these Causes assigned, the plenty of Exhalations and Cold of the airy Regions, I conceived it is, that at Upminster, about the Equinoxes, we have often more Rain than at other Seasons. But I cannot say this is certain and constant. Thus it was at the Autumnal Equinox in 1707, not only at Upminster, but at Pisa too: So at Zurich, Pisa and Upminster about the Vernal in 1708; and at Zurich and Upminster the last Autumnal Equinox. And this very 28th of March 1709. whilst I am writing this, I have a pregnant Proof of what I am saying. For not only the unusual Cold of the Winter hath been succeeded by as unusual quantities of Rain all this Month; but at this very time the Weather is open, but withal cool. Particularly March 26. many Vapours arose, so as to fill the Air with a warm stinking Fog. The Night following a smart shower of Hail fell, a manifest indication of the Cold of the middle, or top of the lower Region of the\nthe Air. And the day after, viz. March 27. proved so wet a day, that almost 5 pound of Rain fell through my Tunnel, a large quantity for the compass of 12 Inches Diameter in 14 or 15 hours time. The Wind and Clouds were all the while calm and still, and frequently changing from Point to Point, near round the whole Compass; and the Rain that fell, fell thick, in small drops. Which makes me think, that the warm foggy Vapours, raised in great plenty the day or two before, as soon as they were mounted aloft, met with sudden extreme Cold of the middle Region, and were thereby hastily condensed, and the Air being at the same time very light (the Barometer being then very low) they speedily tumbled down in small and thick Drops of Rain.\n\nAnd this I take to be the very case of the vernal and autumnal Rains already mentioned, viz. In Spring, when the Earth and Waters are loosed from the brumal Consti- pations, the Vapours arise in great plenty. So also in Autumn, when the Heats that distipated them in Summer, and also warmed the superior Regions, are abated, the Vapours raised then in great plenty are soon condensed by the Cold of the superior Regions, and so are forced down in more plentiful Rains than at other Seasons, when either the Vapours are fewer, or Cold of the superior Regions less.\n\nFor a farther proof, or at least illustration of what hath been said, let us again cast an Eye upon June last, a Month as unseasonably wet, as 'twas unusually Cold. The Cold thereof I have already taken notice of; and the wet Weather accompanying it was so unseasonable to us in South-Britain, that although we had great and welcome Crops of Hay after a great scarcity the preceding Year, yet we had scarcely any good Weather to make it in. So Dr. Scheuchzer faith it was with them in Switzerland, in his Remarks on that Month: Fuit hic mensis, ut ex pluvia mensurati constat, praeter modum humidus, & magno\nno quidem Vegetabilibus Hominibusque danno. Multum computruit Fænum; Gramina, que nondum fuere rescuta, ad minimum venire maturitatis gradum. Vites earumque Flosculi multa sustinerunt damna a Pluvie continuo fere lapsu; deciderunt tenella Petala, Foliis rubigo induita est, ut macra admodum sit Autumni venturi spes, &c.\n\nHaving thus considered the use of Cold to the production of Rain, I shall shut up these Remarks with one thing concerning the Alps; and that is, I cannot but think that those and all such like high Mountains, and the Snows they are covered with, are of great use to the neighbouring, yea more distant Countries, in generating their Rain, and performing other great Offices of Nature. From some Observations I have made in running over, and comparing Dr. Scheuchzer's and my own larger Tables, I have so frequently observed the Risings and Fallings of the Barometer, some of the most considerable Variations of the Wind, the most remarkable Alterations of Heat and Cold, and of wet and dry; I have, I say, so often observed many of these to precede in one place what hath follow'd in another, that I am apt to think that even England may sometimes partake of the effects of the Alpine Mountains upon the Air and Vapours. It is certain that their very cold Weather in December last, and the Relaxation thereof preceded ours: Which makes me inclined to think it might probably be derived from them to us. All the former part of that Month, especially from about the 8th day till the 24th, was here mild and open. But on Christmas-day it began to be colder, and the following days to freeze harder and harder; infomuch that on December 30. my Thermometer was a great deal lower than ever I had seen it before. And two curious Persons in London told me, that the Spirits in their Thermometers fell several degrees lower this last Winter, than they had done in the self-same Thermometers during all the long and remarkable Frost in the Year 1683. Whether\nther at Zurich the Cold was more excessive, than it used to be in other Years, Dr. Scheuchzer doth not say; but he noteth the Air to have been excessively Cold, and his Thermometrical Observations shew it to have been so some time before, in, and after Christmas. And Dr. Newton in a Letter he honoured me with lately from Florence, faith, \"The Cold was there so great, that for twenty Years past they had not been sensible of greater; it wanting on Twelfth-day but half a Degree of the Extremity. Their Twelfth-day I reckon fell on December 26. O.S. and consequently their so eminently Freezing-day preceded ours about four Days.\n\nAnd as their Cold, so by Dr. Scheuchzer's Observations, I find the Relaxation thereof preceded ours a short time. For about the later end of December the Weather appears to have been milder, at least less intensely Cold with them. And so was ours at the beginning of January, about as many days after theirs, as their Cold preceded ours.\n\nThus I have given one eminent Instance of what I found lesser Examples frequently, as I run over Dr. Scheuchzer's last Year's Observations. But whether there may be any farther Reasons for any such Conclusions about the Influences of the Alpine Eminences and Colds upon far distant places, future Observations will I hope determine. But as to their Influences nearer home, Dr. Scheuchzer faith, Alpes fecunda maier sunt, ut Fluminum & Nubium, ita quoque Nivis & Pluviae. Credibile omnino est, loca Mari, Alpibusque viciniora, plus etiam experiri Pluviae praemotoribus aliis.\n\nTo these Remarks I might add Dr. Scheuchzer's Observations of the Occurrences in each Month of what was curious as to Meteors, the State of Health and Diseases, &c. also the increase and decrease of their Zurich River, the Limat, which (like other Rivers that have their Source in the Alps) he puts beyond all doubt (in my Opinion) to receive\nreceive greater Increments from the melting of the Alpine Snows, than from all the wet proceeding from their Rains. But as I have been long already, these things would add more to the length of what I have said; and therefore I shall rather choose to refer to his Observations at large, than injure them by an Abridgment.\n\nHere I was putting an end to my Remarks, but in the same moment I received Letters from the before-commended Dr. Newton from Florence, and Dr. M. A. Tilli from Pisa. In the latter of which are some Observations that so directly relate to what I have before taken notice of, that I must beg Pardon for a small Addition to what I have said.\n\nDr. Tilli's half Year's Rain coming too late, I have put it alone in the additional Table. From which Table compared with the foregoing Tables it appears, that although, in the Year before, June and other Summer-Months were dry, yet last June was a wet Month at Pisa, as well as Zurich and Upminster, and so likewise was it about the Autumnal Equinox: and for the same Reasons, I imagine, which I have already mentioned.\n\nAs to the Excess of the Pisa-Rain above that of other Places (concerning which I wrote to Dr. Tilli) he attributeth it to the same cause (he saith) that I did that of Lancashire, namely, the Height of the Hills, and the Blowing of the Winds for a long time from some one Quarter. His Observation is this, Libenter admittero Pluviam nostram semper, vel ut plurimum vestram superare, ei sane ratione ut animadvertisti; & praecipue aspera Corsica junga, autumni tempore, nive citè cooperiantur: Tunc Australes venti diu vigent & Imbres. Aquilonares vero frequentius circa Florentinos colles, quìm circa Pisanam urbem spirare planè constat. Est enim hæc civitas a Boreè circumdata montibus, & pari intervallo circa milliaria quinque distat a mari.\n\nThe same Account of the Situation of Pisa, and the great quantity of Rain falling there, I remember I had some time\ntime since from a very ingenious Member of this Society. Mr. Afton, who hath been there; who withal added (if I mistake not) that Pisa was for that reason called, or might be called, The Piss-pot of Italy.\n\nBesides what is mentioned, there are in the Letters of those two curious Gentlemen divers other things, some of them relating particularly to this last Winter's remarkably severe Frost in Italy. But these with some other Accounts relating to the same subject, as they may be more seasonable, so I intend them for the Societies Diversion and Service (if God spare a little life and leisure) in a short time.\n\nJust as I was putting a finishing Hand to this, I received from Dublin, Mr. Molyneaux's Observations there of the Weather, Winds, Rain, &c. during the last Years Which I am sorry arrived no sooner, that they might have accompanied, and been seen together with the foregoing Observations. But it being now too late, I shall take some other, though less opportune time, to acquaint this most illustrious Society with them.\nA Table shewing at an easy View the Heights of the Mercury in the Barometer in English Inches and Centesimal parts of an Inch, both at Zurich in Switzerland, and at Upminster in South-Britain, together with the Differences of those Heights, throughout the Year 1708.\n\n| January | February |\n|---------|----------|\n| D.

An Account of an Experiment touching the Propagation of Sound through Water. By Mr. Fr. Hauksbee, F. R. S.\n\nAn Experiment that I made some time since, shewing that actual Sound could not be transmitted through a Vacuum, gave me an Inclination to try what would be the effect, to surround the Receiver that contain'd the sounding Body, with so dense a Medium as Water. Accordingly, as in the former Experiment, the Receiver which contain'd the Bell was screw'd down to a Brass-plate, with a Leather between; This Receiver with its Bell, was suspended in a large Glass-Vessel, by Four Twine-threads to the top, and as many to the bottom: whereby it remain'd in the middle between both. Concluding likewise, that these Threads would so absorb the Water when it should come to be put in, that there could be no Apprehension, that any Sound shou'd be convey'd by them from the sounding Body, any more than if they were entirely Water. Thus provided, the Clapper was made to strike the Bell, whose Sound was something less by the Interposition of the Glass, than it would be, had it been made in the open Air; however it was very audible, and might be heard at a considerable distance: It appear'd to the Ear to be very harsh, in respect to the Tone it afforded us. But now, when the Water came to be pour'd in, and the inward Receiver surrounded by it, at least an Inch and an half from the nearest part of the outward Glass, the Clapper again was made to give the Sound; which it did, seemingly, very little less,\n| Day of Mo. | July Rain at Zurich Lines | July Rain at Upm. l. dec. | August Rain at Zurich Lines | August Rain at Upm. l. dec. | September Rain at
