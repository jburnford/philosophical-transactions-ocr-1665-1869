Having dispatched this Medicinal use, he proceeds next to the use of Niter in Chemistry; where he observeth that by it may be made a pleasant and cooling Acid; or a hot and burning Corrosive: that sometimes it revives the Vomitive and Purgative vertue of Antimony, sometimes it kills the Vomitive, and reviveth only the Purgative; and sometimes it destroyes both, and quickens neither the Diuretick or Diaphoretick, &c. besides that it Calcineth, Sublimeth and Dissolveth Minerals and Metals.\n\nThirdly, he adds the Use of Niter in Artillery; where he discourses of the reason of the Composition and Force of Gun-powder, together with the Use and Office of every Ingredient of the same. Fourthly and lastly, he sets down the Uses of Niter for Refiners, Dyers and Cooks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\nThe Author of the Discourse concerning Mineral waters, in Numb. 60, beginning p. 1074, desireth, that these lines may be inserted p. 1081, after the word Dysenteries, l. 19. viz. Neither do I think this water any thing the worse because of the Alone, but much the better for it in Hypochondriack maladies: For by its adstringency it defends the Tone of the Liver and the other natural parts, which otherwise are apt to be debilitated by purging and penetrating medicines; it being, according to Galen's advice, ever necessary to intermix some Adstringents with Hepatick remedies; in Art. Med. c. 95. to which agree very good writers, antient and modern.\n\nErrat. p. 1096. l. 2. r. if he hit.\n\nLONDON,\n\nPrinted by T.R. for John Martyn, Printer to the Royal-Society. 1670.",
