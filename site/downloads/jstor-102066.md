Tuta, ac efficax Luis Venereæ, saxe absque Mercu-
curio, ac semper sine Salivatione mercuriali,
Curandæ methodus. Authore Davide Aber-
cromby, M.D. Lond, in Octav. 1684.

The Author describes the nature of the French Pox, which he asserts to consist in a cold moist Vapour, lodg'd chiefly in the Organs of Generation, and thence diffused throughout the whole Body: which assertion he endeavours to make good by several Arguments.

He explains the manner, how it first invades, and the several steps of its progress.

He enquires into the nature of Mercury, examines Untzer's Description of it, which he confutes as to some particulars, and at last affirms, that, Mercury is of a moist and cold nature. From the premises he concludes, that Mercury is not proper in this distemper.

He proposes a way of curing the Pox, without the use of Mercury.

A second way of curing the Pox, in which Mercury is used, but not in order to Salivation.
He puts down several topical Remedies, answering some of the severer Symptoms of the Lues.

He describes the Symptoms of it, at its first appearance.

He shews how far the Scurvy and French Pox agree, as to their Symptoms.

He gives the method of curing Virulent Gonorrhea's, and Venereal Bubos.

He relates some approv'd Topical Remedies against the more considerable symptoms attending a Virulent Gonorrhea.

He reckons up the difference between a simple and a Virulent Gonorrhea.

And at last, he considers how well his Remedies are adapted to his Hypothesis, of this Disease.
