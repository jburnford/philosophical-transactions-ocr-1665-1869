IV. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Scarburgh, dated Acomack, July 14. 1694. Giving a Relation of the Effects of a violent Storm of the 19th of October, on the Rivers of that Country. Communicated by the Honourable Sir Robert Southwell, F. R. S.

UPON the 19th Day of October last happened a most violent Storm, which stopped the Course of ancient Channels, and made some where never were any: So that betwixt the Bounds of Virginia and New-Castle (in Pennsylvania) on the Sea-bord side, are many Navigable Rivers for Sloops and small Vessels.

V. An Account of the Damage that hapned in the Isle of Portland the Third of February, 1696. Communicated by the Honourable Sir Robert Southwell, F. R. S.

THE Great Peer is quite demolished and filled up with Rubbish, and the Rocks that lay about 40 Yards off in the Sea at the Peer-head, are risen above Water; so that there is no hopes of making good that Peer again. And the ways leading to that Peer from the Quarry, are turned upside down, and
and sunk at several Places about Thirty Foot. Also the Way leading to the North-Peer, called the little Peer, is under the same Circumstances, and the Peer crackt in several Places; which Peer with some Charge may be repaired. The Earth is slid into the Sea between the Two Peers, near 100 Yards, and is yet working off into the Sea, whereby the Island is damned several Thousand Pounds, besides the Number of Poor People that depended upon their daily Labour in the Quarry, the Work ceasing till Reparation be made, and continues yet dreadful to behold. Which, as is conjectur'd, proceeded from a great Quantity of Rubbish, thrown over the Cliff, upon a Clayish Foundation, that the Violence of Rain made soft, and gave way, and not by Earthquake, as some Report.
