  "text": "Martin Clare Esq; F. R. S. to C. Mortimer M. D. & Secr. R. S. of the same.\n\nSIR,\n\nRead March 8.\n\nAs I was walking this Morning in my Garden at Kensington Gravel-Pits, about 40 Minutes after 5 by my Watch, I felt an exceeding great Shock, a Succussion of the Earth, attended with an Explosion that, I fancy, resembled the blowing up of a Mine, and with the same kind of Noise. It was follow'd by a Trembling, very brisk at first, which gradually abated; and in about 3 Seconds, as near as I can judge, totally ceased. The Tremor was attended with the Noise of a distant Thunder, which, with the Motion, gradually died away.\n\nI am not certain the Building near me moved; but I fancied it did. My Feet I am sure felt great Emotion; and a large Watering-pot, of 9 Inches Base, that stood near me, was thrown all along, the Moment the Trembling ceased.\n\nThis Communication I thought would be acceptable, from,\n\nSIR,\n\nMarch 8, 1749-50.\n\nYour obedient humble Servant,\n\nM. Clare.\n\nP.S. I have since discover'd that my Watering-pot was over-set by a Brick that was thrown off the House by the Shock.",
