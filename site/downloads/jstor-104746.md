The Postscript of a Letter from Mr. Nath. Downe to the Hon. Mr. Greenville, concerning an Earthquake felt at Bridport, on March 18. 1749-50.

SIR,

Bridport, March 19. 1749.

Yesterday Morning the Sun shone very bright; which, between 11 and 12, was with thick dark Clouds so obscured, as render'd it darker than common. Soon after, a violent Clap of Thunder, and a heavy Shower of Hail, succeeded: After which it grew again serene; and in the Evening about 6, a Shock of an Earthquake was felt in this Town, and the neighbouring Villages, with (thro' Mercy) no other Damage than a great Surprize to all who felt it. I am,

SIR,

Your most obedient, and

very humble Servant,

Nath. Downe.
