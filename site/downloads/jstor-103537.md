V. Some material Observations upon dissecting an Ostrich, made lately by Mr. Ranby, Surgeon to his Majesty's Household, and F. R. S.

About five Years ago, I laid before the Society some Observations made in an Ostrich dissected, by Order of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. to which Account I beg Leave to add two or three more Observations which escaped my Notice in my former Dissection. And First, the Eye, the Figure of which, when taken
taken out of the Orbit, I think particular, being almost triangular, with some little Variation in the Bony Scales, from that in Phil. Trans. No. 386. The Contents of the Stomach were of such a Kind, that they were hardly capable (without very great Alteration) of passing the lower Orifice, which is very small.

The Diameter of the Duodenum much smaller than any of the Intestines, and free from Valves, as are the Jejunum and Ileum, except the latter, which has a few Valves, as it approaches near the Colon. The Colon was uneven, with very regular Cells: These Cells were formed by Valves, which were on the Inside, and transversely situated, each making more than half a Circle.

The Parts in other Respects answer the Description given by the several curious Gentlemen that have dissected this Animal.
