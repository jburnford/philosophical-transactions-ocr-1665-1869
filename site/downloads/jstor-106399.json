  "text": "ADDENDA.\n\nAt the end of page 386 add,\n\nIn fig. 4, draw a circle through the points N, M, T; and at the maximum where TP² = PM × NP this circle will touch CA produced in T. From E the center of this circle draw EF perpendicular to NM, also the radii EN and EM; and FN is the sine of NEE, or half NEM, or of its equal MTN, to the radius EN. But EN = ET = FF = \\(\\frac{PN + PM}{2}\\), and FN = \\(\\frac{PN - PM}{2}\\). Therefore PN + PM is to PN - PM, or CD + CB is to CD - CB, or CA + CB is to CA - CB, as radius is to the sine of the greatest angle of deviation, which is therefore equal to \\(\\frac{CA - CB}{CA + CB}\\), radius being unity.\n\nERRATA to Vol. LXX.\n\nPage 6, line ante penult. read be nearly mathematically.\n\n6, l. penult. dele yet.\n\n7, l. 13, dele section ABC, or\n\n7, l. 18, at the end of the line add very nearly.\n\n394, l. 15, transposē general equation to the beginning of the line above.\n\n402, l. 6, 7, 8, for 9143 r. 9443.\n\n405, l. 7, for the last, \\(1 + \\sqrt{-3} r.\\) \\(1 - \\sqrt{-3}\\).\n\n405, l. 11, for the last \\(-\\frac{\\sqrt{-3}}{2} r.\\) \\(+\\frac{\\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\).\n\n443, end of the 1st line, for and x r. and X.\n\n548, l. 10, for circumstances r., and which are.\n\n* * * There are FIFTEEN Plates in this Volume.",
