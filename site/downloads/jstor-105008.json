S.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nRead Dec. 16. 1756.\n\nAs I have made a great many calculations, relative to Annuities on Lives, and have otherwise contributed, as much as was in my Power, to facilitate the performance of such, I thought it, almost, a duty incumbent on me, to compute the values of them according to your curious Table of the Decrements of Life, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions; accordingly I have inclosed a table of them, and if you find it will bear examination I desire you to communicate it to the Royal Society, in order (if approved of) to its being inserted, as an appendix to your letter to the President. I am,\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nYour most obedient and\n\nmost humble Servant,\n\nChrist's-Hospital,\nDec. 8, 1756.\n\nJames Dodson.\n\nA Table\nA Table of the Value of an Annuity of One Pound, payable yearly, during a Life of any Age, allowing compound Interest at 4l. per Cent. per Ann. computed from the Table of the Decrement of Life, constructed by the Reverend William Brakenridge, D.D.
