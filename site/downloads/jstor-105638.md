|------------|------------|
| June 19    | 33° 55' 41½" By Antares. |
| June 21    | 33° 55' 40½" Per Spica. |

| July 3     | 55° 37" |
| Sept. 22   | 55° 43" |
| July 2     | 55° 30" μ Scorpii. |
| July 1     | 55° 47" λ Scorpii. |
| July 2     | 55° 44" δ Sagittarii. |
| July 12    | 55° 29" σ Scorpii. |
| Aug. 8     | 55° 40" Antares. |
| Aug. 10    | 51° 57" α Aquilæ. |

Mean = 33° 55' 40½" Or, by leaving out the observation of α Aquilæ, and three of the least, it gives 33° 55' 42+ = Latitude South.
