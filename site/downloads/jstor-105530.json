S.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAmsterdam, 22d Feb. 1763.\n\nHAVING lately received from Mr. Hommel, governor of the hospital at Batavia, many uncommon fishes, well preserved, amongst them is one as curious for its shape, as for its extraordinary manner of obtaining its food. It is new to me, and, I believe, hath never been observed by any writer on natural history. [Vide Tab. X.]\n\nI request the favour, that you will present this rare fish to the Royal Society, as a small, but sincere proof of the gratitude and esteem, which I really have for that respectable, learned body.\n\nGovernor Hommel gives the following account of the Jaculator or shooting fish, a name alluding to its nature. It frequents the shores and sides of the sea and rivers, in search of food. When it spies a fly sitting on the plants, that grow in shallow water, it swims on to the distance of four, five, or six feet, and then, with a surprizing dexterity, it ejects out of its tubular-mouth a single drop of water, which never fails striking the fly into the sea, where it soon becomes its prey.\n\nVol. LIV.\nThe relation of this uncommon action of this cunning fish raised the governor's curiosity; though it came well attested, yet he was determined, if possible, to be convinced of the truth, by ocular demonstration.\n\nFor that purpose, he ordered a large wide tun to be filled with sea-water; then had some of these fish caught, and put into it, which was changed every other day. In a while, they seemed reconciled to their confinement; then he determined to try the experiment.\n\nA slender stick, with a fly pinned on at its end, was placed in such a direction, on the side of the vessel, as the fish could strike it.\n\nIt was with inexpressible delight, that he daily saw these fish exercising their skill in shooting at the fly, with an amazing velocity, and never missed the mark.\n\nIn looking over that noble work of the Museum of the king of Sweden, printed anno 1754, I met with this Jaculator, well engraven, and described, by the learned Baron Linnæus, under the title of Chætodon, pag. 61, plate 33.\n\nBaron Linnæus's Description.\n\nAcanthopterygii-chætodon.\nChætodon rostratum, pinna dorsali postice macula fusca.\n\nCorpus ovatum, compressum; fascia grisea perpendicularis fecat caput per oculos. Fascia grisea perpendicularis ab initio pinnæ dorsalis descendit ante pectorales ad ventrales. Fascia grisea perpendicularis in\nmedio pisce. Fascia fusca saturatior cingit caudam ante radios. Macula fusca orbicularis in medio pin-\nnæ dorsalis ubi mutica.\n\nCaput rostro elongato, fere ut in syngnathis, dentes in maxillis minimi. Narium foramina utrinque 2 ante oculos, membranæ branchiospegæ ossicula 5. Opercula branchiarum squamis tecta, ut in reliquis congeneribus. Pinnæ dorsi et ani æquales, valde transversæ, et lateribus squamis tectæ. Dorsalis radiis 9–31 primoribus mucronatis, posterioribus 31 mollibus, longioribus. Pectorales radiis 14. Ventrales radiis 6 mollibus, excepto primo spinoso; eorum secundus reliquis longior. Ani radiis 3–20 posterioribus 20 longioribus, mollibus; primis 3 spinosis, caudæ radiis 14, æqualibus; parva\n\nAccedit proxime ad LABRUM rostro reflexo fasciis lateralibus tribus fuscis, Amoen.
