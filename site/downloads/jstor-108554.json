And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever since steadily pursued.\n\nBut the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more numerous, it was thought advisable that a Committee of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752. And the grounds of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them; without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published, which must still rest on the credit or judgement of their respective authors.\n\nIt is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body,\nupon any subject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore\nthe thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors\nof such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through\nwhose hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a\nmatter of civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communica-\ntions. The like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions,\nand curiosities of various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society; the authors\nwhereof, or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report and even to\ncertify in the public newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and\napprobation. And therefore it is hoped that no regard will hereafter be paid to such\nreports and public notices; which in some instances have been too lightly credited,\nto the dishonour of the Society.\n\nThe Meteorological Journal hitherto kept by the Assistant Secretary at the Apart-\nments of the Royal Society, by order of the President and Council, and published in\nthe Philosophical Transactions, has been discontinued. The Government, on the\nrecommendation of the President and Council, has established at the Royal Obser-\nvatory at Greenwich, under the superintendence of the Astronomer Royal, a Magneti-\ncal and Meteorological Observatory, where observations are made on an extended\nscale, which are regularly published. These, which correspond with the grand\nscheme of observations now carrying out in different parts of the globe, supersede\nthe necessity of a continuance of the observations made at the Apartments of the\nRoyal Society, which could not be rendered so perfect as was desirable, on account\nof the imperfections of the locality and the multiplied duties of the observer.\nA List of Public Institutions and Individuals, entitled to receive a copy of the Philosophical Transactions of each year, on making application for the same directly or through their respective agents, within five years of the date of publication.\n\n**Observatories.**\n\nArmagh.\nCape of Good Hope.\nDublin.\nEdinburgh.\nGreenwich.\nMadras.\n\n**Institutions.**\n\nBarbadoes .............Library and Museum.\nCalcutta ..............Asiatic Society.\nCambridge ............Philosophical Society.\nDublin ................Royal Dublin Society.\nEdinburgh ............Royal Irish Academy.\nLondon ................Admiralty Library.\nChemical Society.\nEntomological Society.\nGeological Society.\nGeological Survey of Great Britain.\nHorticultural Society.\nInstitute of British Architects.\nInstitution of Civil Engineers.\nLinnean Society.\nLondon Institution.\nMedical and Chirurgical Society.\nQueen's Library.\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\nRoyal Astronomical Society.\nRoyal College of Physicians.\nRoyal Geographical Society.\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain.\nRoyal Society of Literature.\nSociety of Antiquaries.\nSociety for the Encouragement of Arts.\nThe Treasury Library.\nUnited Service Museum.\nZoological Society.\n\nMalta ..................Public Library.\nManchester ...........Literary and Philosophical Society.\nOxford .................Ashmolean Society.\nRadcliffe Library.\nSwansea ...............Royal Institution.\nWoolwich .............Royal Artillery Library.\n\n**Belgium.**\n\nBrussels ...............Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\n**Denmark.**\n\nAltona .................Royal Observatory.\nCopenhagen ...........Royal Society of Sciences.\n\n**France.**\n\nParis ..................Academy of Sciences.\nDépôt de la Marine.\nÉcole des Mines.\n\nParis ..................Entomological Society.\nGeographical Society.\nGeological Society.\nJardin des Plantes.\nToulouse ..............Academy of Sciences.\n\n**Germany.**\n\nBonn ..................Casarean Acad. of Naturalists.\nGöttingen ............University.\nMannheim ............Observatory.\nMunich ...............Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\n**Italy.**\n\nNaples ................Institute of Sciences.\nMilan ................Institute of Sciences, Letters and Arts.\nModena ...............Italian Society of Sciences.\nTurin ................Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\n**Netherlands.**\n\nAmsterdam ............Royal Institute.\nRotterdam ............Batavian Society of Experimental Philosophy.\n\n**Prussia.**\n\nBerlin ................Royal Academy of Sciences.\nSociety of Experimental Philosophy.\n\n**Portugal.**\n\nLisbon ................Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\n**Russia.**\n\nPulkowa ..............Observatory.\nSt. Petersburgh ......Imperial Academy of Sciences.\n\n**Spain.**\n\nCadiz ................Observatory.\n\n**Sweden and Norway.**\n\nDrontheim ............Royal Society of Sciences.\nStockholm ............Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\n**Switzerland.**\n\nGeneva ...............Société de Phys. et d'Hist.
