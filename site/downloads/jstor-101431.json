  "text": "ly know, whether that Sally be more easie to discover, than the shadows of the satellites, which Campani believes, August hath not seen; and whether he be assured, that those obscure parts, which he there distinguishes, do not change: for if they should not change, then Jupiter would not turn about his Axis, which yet, he faith, it doth, according to the Observation made by Mr. Hook, May 9 1664. inserted in the first papers of these Transactions. The full Discovery of which particular also he makes to be a part of Cassini's and Campani's work, seeing that they so distinctly see the inequalities in the Belts, and see also sometimes other spots besides the shadows of the Satellites: where he exhorts all the Curious, that have the conveniency of observing, to endeavor the discovery of a matter of that importance, which would prove one of the greatest Analogies for the Earth's Motion.\n\nAn Account of Mr. Richard Lower's newly published Vindication of Doctor Willis's Diatriba de Febribus.\n\nThe Title of this Curious piece, is, Diatriba Thesae Willisi Med. Doct. & Profess. Oxon. De Febribus Vindicatio, Authore Richardo Lower, &c. In it are occasionally discussed many considerable Medical and Anatomical inquiries, as, Whether a Fever does consist in an Effervescence of Blood? And if so, of what kind? Whether there be a Nervous and Nutritious Juice? Whether the office of sanguification belongs to the Blood itself, existing before those Viscera (at least) that are commonly esteemed to be the Organs of sanguification? How Nutrition is performed, and the nourishing substance assimilated? Whether the Blood affords both the Matter for the structure of the Body, and such parts also, as are fit for the nourishment of the same? Whether the Pulse of the Heart ceasing, there remains yet a certain Motion in the blood, arguing, that Pulse and Life do ultimately rest in the Blood? Whether the Umbilical Vessels convey the blood of the Mother to the Child, or whether the Fetus be for the most part form'd and\nacted by the circulating blood, before the existence of the Umbilical Vessels, or before the connecting of the Fetus with the Uterus? A new Experiment to prove, that the Chyle is not transmuted into Blood by the Liver. A discourse of the Nature of the Blood, and what difference there is between the Venal and Arterial blood, and for what Uses both the one and the other are particularly designed. Where it is considered, what Life is, and whence the Soul of Brutes, and its subsistence, and operations do depend. It is also required into, what the uses of the Lungs are in hot Animals? And many other such material disquisitions are to be found in this small, but very Ingenious and Learned Treatise.\n\nA Note touching a Relation, inserted in the last Transactions.\n\nIn the Experiment of killing Ratle-Snakes, mentioned in the last of the precedent Papers (wherein, by a mistake, these words, The way, were put for A way, or An Experiment) it should have been added, that the Gentleman there mention'd, did affirm, that, in those places, where the Wild Penny-Royal or Dittany grows, no Ratle-Snakes are observed to come.\n\nErrata.\n\nPag. 59. line 11. read, bignesses, l. 20. r. endure, for, refist. l.30. r. those, for, these. l. 31. r. Plain, for, place.\n\nLONDON,\n\nPrinted with Licence, By John Martyn, and James Allestry, Printers to the Royal-Society, at the Bell in St. Pauls Church-Yard. 1665.",
