Part of a Letter of Mr. Dale from Braintree, Feb. 1. 1699. to Dr. Martin Lister, Fellow of the College of Physicians and R. S. concerning several Insects.\n\nHerewith you will receive a Cervus volans or two, which I take to be different from those described by Mouset in his Theat. Insect. p. 148, 149; these are plentifully found about Colchester, especially towards the Sea-Coast. Besides these I have happened upon divers sorts of Scarabs, which I cannot find figured in your curious Tabulae Mutae in the Appendix Hist. Animal. Angl. as the Benzæs Mouset. p. 152. a Species or two of Cantharides, three or four sorts of Lady Bugs, and others; which, although of most of them I have at present but single Specimens, yet if you desire the sight of them to design and fill up the Vacancies of your Plates with, they shall be sent up to you. Last Summer being on our Sea-Coast at Harwich, I observed no less than five or six Species of Cochleæ Marine two of which I have since found to be already noted by you in your excellent Hist. Conchyl. as of English Production, viz. Sect. 5. n. 19. and 43. A third I have which is by you figured, viz. n. 13. but is not marked as found in England. The fourth agrees with your n. 8. in Figure, but having no Name, I cannot be positive, I therefore desire your Name of it:",
