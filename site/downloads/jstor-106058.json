On the 10th at night, after hail showers, a great fall of snow; the 11th great snow falling, with stormy blasts; the 12th deep snow and more falling, with frost; deep snow, and hard frost, the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th, snow lying deep, but the frost more gentle and the thaw came on; the 20th P.M. it thawed fast; on the 21st in the afternoon, the frost and snow was all gone; the rest of the month mostly misty with some hard showers of rain. Wind, during the storms, mists, and rain, Westerly for 16 days; during the cold, East, and East North East. |\n\n* This is the last paper of this kind, which the Society will receive from the excellent author of the Natural History of Cornwall, and several other learned works; death having, though at an advanced age, put a period to a life divided between the pursuit of useful and experimental knowledge, and the faithful discharge of every moral and religious duty.

On the 28th however, there was most violent thunder, lightning, and a flood of rain, at the towns of Penryn and Falmouth, 20 miles distant from Mount's-Bay to the East; but in Mount's-Bay, the air was cloudy, and only some distant thunders; the lightning was scarce visible, and not a drop of rain. | Highest 27 71\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | Med.

Wind 24 days from the West, mixed mostly with the South. N. B. As we had a most unusual run of dry weather here in Cornwall; in other parts of the world, they had altogether as extraordinary a glut of rain. See, for particulars, the publick papers, from Berlin, Dresden, Hamburgh, and Vienna, &c. in Europe, and from Virginia in North America, where their inundations have not been remembered for destructive. | Highest 17 72\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | Lowest 31 54\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 61\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) 0,720 |\n\nMonth.\n| Month   | Barometer | State of the Weather and Wind | Fahrenheit’s Thermom. | Ombr. |\n|---------|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|\n| August  | Highest 29 30.0 | Calm, 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 15th, 17th, 22d, 23d, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st; the rest misty,ogs, and rains, with some gales interspersed.

On the 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th, stormy with rain and showers. Wind 24 days from the West, mixed mostly with the South. N. B. This month was very dry in Cornwall; but by the incessant rains in the middle of it, from the 15th to the 17th, such inundations happened at Newcastle, Durham, Barnard-castle, and near Carlisle, by the breaking out of Solway-moss, as have never been known so destructive. | Highest 16 55 | Lowest 10 39 } 47\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) | 1.450 |\n\nMonth.\n| Month | Barometer | State of the Weather and Wind | Fahrenheit's Thermom. | Ombr. |\n|-------|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------|-------|\n|       |           | Calm, 1st, 2d, 8th, 13th, 17th, 18th. On Friday the 6th (new-moon at 8 A.M. wind South by East, and South East) about 8 P.M. it blew a violent storm, and setting full into Mount's Bay at spring-tide, the sea was so high, and furious, that it demolished houses, cellars, boats, and walls, wherever it reached. The four towns on the shore all suffered; and it has been calculated, that not less than £5000 damage was done here that night, besides ships lost. It reached to the Eastward; and at Plymouth, about 60 miles off, they reckoned the tide was higher by ten feet than usual. The remainder of this month was showery, rainy, windy. Wind Westerly 24 days, mixed mostly with the South. |\n\nThe whole Rain fallen in this Year 1771, at Ludgvan, a very dry Year,",
