I CAN'T help informing you (as it is a Matter of Concern to every one) that, on Monday Night last, about 10 o'Clock, we felt in this City a Shock of an Earthquake. It was sensibly felt by all or most of the Inhabitants. A few Bricks were shook off a Chimney in Forest-street; several House-bells were rung; the Centinel at the Castle was shook off his Seat in the Centry-box; the Houses all over the Town were shaken, and the People terribly frighten'd and alarm'd. It has been felt for some Miles round the Town, particularly at Barn-Hill, where the Houses were greatly shaken. We are in great Fears of another more violent.
