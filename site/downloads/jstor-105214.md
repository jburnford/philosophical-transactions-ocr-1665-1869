A happy discovery indeed, should this prove the consequence of it, as I heartily wish it may, for the ease and benefit of the miserable part of mankind, who fall under our hands; and am,

Four of the seven towers are much hurt; one of them, which is an octagon, has two of its sides thrown down from top to bottom. It is said several of the Janisaries, who were upon guard there, are killed. The three other of the four are much shatter'd, and part of the walls fallen down. All the turrets upon the city-wall, from the seven towers to the Adrianople-gate, are much shatter'd, though none fallen: all the cupolas of the portico of Sultan Mahomet the II'd's mosque are thrown down: the Sickergee Han, a strong stone building near the above mosque, is quite destroyed: some part of the wall of the Cara Han is thrown down: one bagnio is quite fallen, and many people said to be destroyed in it. The Cautirligee Han is quite down; and the Vizir
