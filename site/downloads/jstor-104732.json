  "text": "We see and admire the Effects of Electricity, and its stupendous Properties, every Day; which seems as it were an animating Soul to Matter. The Antients had a Notion that the Earth was a great Animal; probably from some Observations of Electricity; but certainly, when in our Days we feel these unusual and extraordinary Convulsions of Nature, it is a Lesson to us, to do our Duty toward that Great Being, who, by a Drop of Water can produce Effects so prodigious.\n\nMarch 13.\n1749-50.\n\nWilliam Stukely.\n\nXXV.\n\nExtract of a Letter to Mr. J. Ellicott F.R.S. concerning an Earthquake at Portsmouth, March 18. 1749-50.\n\nRead March 22.\n1749.\n\nBy a Letter I had from Mr. Oakes at Portsmouth, dated the 19th instant, he gives me an Account of the Inhabitants being alarm'd with a severe Shock of an Earthquake on Sunday the 18th at Six o'Clock in the Evening; and that it was felt stronger at the Common, which is about three Quarters of a Mile distant.\n\nXXVI.",
