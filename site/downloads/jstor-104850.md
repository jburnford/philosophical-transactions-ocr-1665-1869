The Star immers'd into the dark Limb.

It emerg'd from the enlighten'd Limb a small Matter to the West of the Moon's Zenith.

The Moon's preceding Limb pass'd the Meridian in the Transitory.

The Star pass'd the Meridian.

Mr. Short, another Gentleman, and myself, agreed to a single Second in the Immersion, with different Telescopes; but I saw and pronounced the Emer- sion 2 or 3 Seconds before them.—There had been an exact Observation of the Sun's Transit at Noon; and the Clock gain'd about half a Second a Day.

Mr. John Catlin had a few Days before deliver'd me a Computation of this Eclipse, corrected from two Places of the Moon, observ'd the 28th of February and the 2d of March 1729, corresponding pretty nearly with her present Situation; as likewise from the Star's Position, as I had rectify'd it from several late Observations; and this gave the

On the 8th of March 1746-7, near 1746-7.

The Morning was fine and clear, the Sun shone bright, no Cloud to be seen, but the Air a little hazy: Where the Phenomenon appeared, which was a bright cloudy Spot, seem'd a very small Portion of a Rainbow,
