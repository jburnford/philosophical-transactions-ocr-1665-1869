  "text": "ELOCUTION AND POLITE LITERATURE.\n\nMR. HENRY SMEATHMAN, who was many years a pupil of the late Mr. Rice, and before he went on his travels, practised with success that Author's ingenious method of teaching to read, speak and write, with ease, energy and propriety; begs leave to offer his services to the public in the same mode of useful and polite instruction.\n\nGentlemen intending themselves for the Church, the Bar or the Senate, will by oral and familiar conversation, in a few months, receive more improvement, than by a solitary study of many years, in an art not taught in our Schools or Universities, yet absolutely necessary to those who wish to excel in public or polite life, or aspire to eminence in eloquence and literature.\n\nBy this art, a liberal education is improved and accomplished, classical learning advantageously displayed, and the want of a proficiency in the dead and other languages supplied, as by Mr. Smeathman's method, founded on that of Mr. RICE, the pupils may acquire a critical knowledge of the idiom and elegance of their own without them.\nThis recommends it peculiarly to the attention of all those who wish to have the pleasure of reading the English classic authors with grace and propriety, or to write and speak correctly; of those Gentlemen, who are intended for the Navy, the Army, the Public-office or the Counting-house; or whose juvenile studies may have been obliterated by an early introduction into those situations; and of all those who may have been deprived of the advantages of a liberal education.\n\nThey are effectually cured of any defects in pronunciation, which do not arise from an imperfection in the organs of speech; and instead of provincial, disagreeable or absurd habits, they acquire an energetic, a persuasive and a graceful manner of speaking, reading and reciting. Above all, the younger pupils receive this singular and important advantage, that their minds are opened more early, their reason is assisted in its exertions, and directed to such objects as naturally promote the perfection, and the happiness of human beings.\n\nThis method is equally well adapted to both sexes, those advanced in life may receive instruction privately, as usual, and Ladies will be attended at their own houses.\n\nApplication may be made to Mr. Smeathman, at his Chambers, No 14. Clement's-Inn. Of whom, in a few days, may be had a short Treatise on the nature of eloquence, and the importance of learning to read, speak and write our own language, independent of all others; with a plan of his mode of teaching, and the advantages to be derived from it.\n\nThe following are detached extracts from the above-mentioned Treatise.\n\n\"Those\n\"Those who have not studied and been exercised in reading, speaking or composing, in their own language, will not do either in such a manner as to claim or deserve attention; and it is the talent of performing them with ease, energy and propriety, which we call eloquence.\n\n\"People are usually very solicitous to have their children instructed in all those liberal arts, which are deemed requisite to perfect them as Gentlemen and Scholars: and surely as nothing contributes more to this intention, they would not omit oratory, if they thought it was to be learned. They listen with rapture to the charms of eloquence, but are not aware that it is in their power to procure this inestimable talent for those who are the objects of their incessant care and daily anxiety.\"\n\n\"This can only arise from the erroneous idea that oratory is not to be taught or acquired. Yet no art is more simple in its Principles, or clearer in its rules, and no rules are more easily reduced to practice, or more certainly practised with success.\"\n\n\"It is granted that people may improve themselves much by private declamation. The art of eloquence, however, is in this respect like fencing, in which a man can learn very little by pushing against a wall: he may indeed strengthen his muscles, and enable himself to bear the fatigue, but it is by frequent exertion with a master only that he can expect to acquire skill.\"\n\"It is from the friendly observations, the oral information,\nthe frequent contentions and the unrestrained corrections,\nof a skilful companion, that a student in oratory can derive\nessential improvement: writing alone can no more commu-\nnicate the art than it can speech to the dumb.\n\nThose therefore who educate their children for eminent\nstations in life, with the hope that they will one day render\nthemselves conspicuous in the Senate, the Church or the\ncourts of Law and Justice, without having them grounded in\nthe first principles of eloquence, expect to reap where they\nhave not sown: they must in all probability be disappoint-\ned.\"\n\n\"There is scarce a man of a moderate age and capacity not\nborn with some invincible imperfection in the organs of\nspeech, who may not in twelve months be enabled to com-\nmunicate his thoughts with pleasure to his audience, and\ncredit to himself; or so to read the Liturgy as to excite\nDevotion in the most lukewarm, and to confirm it by a na-\ntural, persuasive and convincing manner of delivering the\ngreat and essential truths of Religion; and how much this\nis to be wished is left to the opinion of all who have heard\nthe disgusting and unedifying manner in which the finest\ncompositions are generally delivered in our public places of\nworship, and seen the awkward figures some of our learned\nSenators make when they attempt to speak in Parliament.\"\n\n\"We have hitherto treated only of the most obvious advan-\ntages arising from the study of eloquence. On a closer\nview,\"\n\"view, many other important benefits will be found to be\nderived from it. Of these, opening the mind, improving\nthe heart and infusing a desire of knowledge, deserve par-\nticular notice. Such is the tendency, effect and benefit, of\nthe mode of instruction here recommended; for as it applies\ndirectly to the understanding without burthening the me-\nmory, or perplexing the mind, the youngest pupils recur\nto it with delight; and its uncommon success, when at-\ntempted, has arisen from the immediate conviction which\nthey feel, that our path to knowledge is pleasant, and\nthe possession of it highly advantageous and desirable.\"\n\n\"Our youth are generally very defective in those polite\nBranches of Knowledge without which classical Learning is\nof little use. Their manners frequently continue rough and\npuerile, when they ought to be, graceful and manly, their\nspeech inarticulate or slovenly, diffonant or defective, dis-\nagreeable, and often unintelligible; and very few, even\namong those who are good scholars, can read or write their\nown language with ease or propriety: an accomplishment\nabsolutely necessary to those who wish to derive any advan-\ntage from extensive knowledge or profound erudition.\"\n\n\"Young People are naturally emulous of the company of\npersons respectable either for their Rank or Abilities, and if\nthey pass their time with low or ignorant people it is for\nwant of being properly introduced and accustomed to mix in\nthe conversation of men of polished manners and liberal ac-\ncomplishments.\"\n\n\"The mode of Instruction here recommended, must neces-\nsarily in its Course remove these Defects, and the prejudices.\"\nintailed on them; and promote the acquisition of those\nusefull arts, on which the Success of life so much depends.\"\n\n\"In the prosecution of it their Curiosity is excited and di-\nrected to proper objects, and a desire for general knowledge\nthe great foundation of excellence, implanted by making them\nacquainted with such remarkable things in nature and art\nas are worthy of Attention. Instead of a slovenly or ungrace-\nfull mode of speaking, they are taught to deliver their senti-\nments with propriety and precision according to times and\ncircumstances; consequently their manner when improper\nis reformed insensibly, and without appearing an object of\nattention; their Minds are cultivated by frequent appeals\nto their understanding, and their judgements regulated by\nthe constant habit of observation and reflection, exercised\nin a Minute enquiry into the Truth and propriety of such\nthoughts as they are directed to in the course of their study.\nThus being early qualified for the company of well bred and\nintelligent people they appear with becoming confidence and\nsatisfaction on all occasions.\"",
