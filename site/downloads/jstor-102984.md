the White Conduit, situate on the West of Islington, with much
the like success as the former. Upon shaking the Bell before any
Air was intruded, it was but just audible at 30 yards distance.
Upon the Injection of one Atmosphere (begging leave as before to
call it so) it became then as audible at 60 yards, as it was before
at 30. A second being intruded, the Bell upon shaking might then
be heard at 90 yards distance. But after that, tho near 100 strokes
of the forces were repeated, yet could it hardly be heard 20 yards
farther. Which I attribute in a great measure to the Reasons be-
fore given. The Morning was very Misty, which caus'd a great
Dew upon the Grass. Little or no Wind stirring. And the silence
requisite in making such an Experiment nicely, at last began to be
interrupted by the sounds of the five a Clock Bells, and other
Noises which joyn'd in Chorus with them from the City, contri-
buting in some measure to the unsuccesfulness of the latter part of
the Experiment: Which still I hope to prosecute farther, not de-
spairing of finding such a Gage as will show the Certainty of the
Quantities injected, without any danger or hazard in the Attempt.

VIII. An Experiment made at a Meeting of the Royal Society,
touching the Diminution of Sound in Air rarefy'd. By Mr Fr.
Hauksbee.

A Bell being included under a Receiver, which being shaken
to make the Clapper strike, it was very observable that the
interposition of the Glass betwixt the Bell and the Ear, was a
great obstruction to its Sound, notwithstanding it was audible at
some good distance from it: But gradually withdrawing the Air,
and making several Stops to shake the Bell at different Degrees
of Rarefaction, the Diminution of the Sound at every Stop was
very distinguishable. Till at last, when the Receiver was well
exhausted of Air, the remains of Sound was then so little, that the
best Ears could but just distinguish it: It appearing to them like a
small shrill Sound as at a great remoteness. Upon suffering the
Air to re enter (which was not done all at once, but by turns)
'twas easy to perceive the increase of Sound at the different times
the Bell was made to ring: The Recipient being again replac'd
with Air, the Sound then seem'd something more clear and audi-
ble than it did upon its first inclusion.
