  "text": "IV. The Extract of a Letter from Mr. Mark Lewis, confirming the same Operation on other Persons.\n\nShe put the Café beyond all dispute; (1.) By shewing me the Head of the Worm in the Orifice before she extracted it. (2.) He was still sensible of their approach before she could see them. (3.) She designed, what he intended to have done, that an Incision shall when he comes to Town, be made in the place, that if Worms be not then found, she may then be well spoken of.\n\nTo me she gave a Catalogue of several Cures she had done in the Town and Country, one was my own Relation, I know to be a truth.\n\nThus far we went over-night, she took Fifteen or Sixteen Worms out next Morning. I found Mr. Newton desirous to see the Operation, he was a Stranger to us both; but we complied with his desire, were extrem glad of his Company when he told us it was on your Account.\n\nHe took the same Care I had done, saw the same Effects I had done over-night, only now there were not above Ten Worms; they came by two at a time, once as I remember three.\n\nI designed to have sent you some to compare with yours; told her of the Fraud my Friend, Mr. Popple, had detected in the Stamford Woman.\n\nI had provided some first Cotton in a small Box, but why, I know not, they now all dyed the same day before I was got home, when as formerly I had kept them Fourteen or Fifteen days; they had fasted three days before I had them.\nI had the Curiosity to try whether I could find any Blood in them, but did not; which makes me think they feed of the same Humour they are bred of.\n\nV. Part of a Letter from Mr. Edw. Lhwyd, to Dr. Lister; giving some farther Account of the Fiery Exhalation in Merionydh-shire.\n\nHonoured Sir,\n\nI Discoursed with an Intelligent Sober Person, that lives near Harlech in Merionydh-shire, who assured me the Fire still continues there; that it is observed to come from a place called Morva bychan in Caernarvonshire, about Eight or Nine Miles off, [over part of the Sea.] That Cattle of all sorts, as Sheep, Goats, Hogs, Cows, and Horses, still dye apace; and that for certain, any great Noise, as Winding of Horns, Drums, &c. does repel it from any House, or Barn, or Stacks of Hay; upon account of which Remedy, they have had few or no Losses in that kind since Christmas. That it happened during this Summer, at least one Night in a Week, and that commonly either Saturday or Sunday; but that now of late it appears something oftner. The place whence it proceeds is both Sandy and Marshy. This is all I could gather from him, material.",
