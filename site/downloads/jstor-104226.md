XIV. Part of a Letter from M. Geoffroy, F.R.S. and Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. late President of the Royal Society, concerning a Child of a monstrous Size.

Read Dec. 22. 1743.

Normandy has furnished us some Years ago a Child, monstrous by its Size, and a Strength which its Age could not naturally afford. It was born at Rouen, and is a Prodigy of Virility, of Three Years and Two Months of Age, perhaps One Month older, and is now in the Hospital at Rouen. It has a very large Neck, the Breast very broad, and the Belly bigger than in its natural State. The upper Part of the Thighs is a little thickish, the rest is conformable to its Age. He has Hair only about the Privy Parts; the Penis is Three Inches long when there is no Erection, but of Six when there is any. They have found him to have Emi-
sions. The Fact is very true, and M. Le Cat, F.R.S. a Surgeon at Rouen, has fully traced it out.—
