Philip Wells, Surveyor General of this Province, in the Year 1686, observ'd it to be $8^\\circ 45'$; by which, it appears to decrease about $1^\\circ 25'$ in 38 Years, or a little more than two Minutes in a Year.\n\nIII. A New Contrivance for taking Levels, by the Reverend John Theophilus Desaguliers, L. L. D. R. S. S.\n\nThat the Air Thermometer is also a Barometer, has been observ'd long ago; and, because the Liquor in it will rise and fall, as well by the Change of the Weight of the Air, as by the Air's Rarefaction by Heat and Cold, this Instrument has no longer been made use of as a Thermometer, and, in its stead, Spirit of Wine Thermometers, hermetically seal'd, have been us'd ever since.\n\nBut, because the Errors of the Air Thermometer (or its Difference from the Spirit Thermometer) depend only upon the Change of the Weight of the Atmosphere from what it was, when the two Thermometers were set at the same Degree of their respective Scales; the late Dr. Hook contriv'd an Instrument, that he call'd a Marine Barometer, made of a Combination of the two abovemention'd Thermometers; in such Manner, that a third Scale being made use of, to observe the Difference of the two Thermometers, thereby the Change of the Air's Gravity, and consequently Storms, Rains, and fair Weather, might be foretold at Sea, where the Quicksilver Barometer becomes useless by the flanking of the Ship.",
