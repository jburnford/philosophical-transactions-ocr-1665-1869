Em. of μ Geminorum, from the Moon’s bright limb. Certain to 5 or 10 seconds, with Dollond’s 3½ feet telescope.

May 9

Em. of ξ Geminorum, from the Moon’s bright limb, with a 2 feet reflector. The true emersion is supposed to have been about 5 seconds sooner.

Mean
Mean time.

Sept. 15

8 1 43.3 im. of 16 Piscium, at D's bright limb,
with 6 f. reflector, certain to 1".

between 10 22 47.3
and 49",3
with 6 feet refl.

between 10 22 50.3
and 51",3
with 2 f. ref. by W. B.

Sept. 20

10 28 19.6 im. of 1st x Tauri, with both telescopes exactly the same.

11 12 28.2 em. of 1st x Tauri, at D's dark limb,
with 2 feet reflector.

11 16 54.5 em. of 2d x Tauri, with both telescopes exactly the same.

Sept. 25

17 24 14.6 im. b Leonis, at D's bright limb,
with 6 feet refl.

17 24 12.6 ditto, with 2 f. reflector, by W. B.

The star was eclipsed to the north of the Moon's center, and the time seemed certain to less than a second, with both telescopes.

Nov. 18

14 39 3.7 im. of 2d α Cancri, at D's bright limb,
with 2 f. refl. Uncertain to 10".

15 5 49.3 em. of ditto, at D's dark limb, instantaneous, and the same with both telescopes.
