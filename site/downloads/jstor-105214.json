Gooch.\n\nC. Extract of a Letter from Mons. Bonnet, F. R. S. of Geneva, to John Clephane, M. D. F. R. S. translated from the French.\n\nGeneva, June 3, 1754.\n\nRead Dec. 12, 1754.\n\nTHE inoculation of the small-pox continues to be attended with the greatest success in our city. Of seventy, who were inoculated, there was not one in any danger. Lausanne has been as it were forced to imitate us; and we hope, that this excellent method, which we received from England, will spread itself from one place to another, for the good of mankind.\n\nMons. de la Condamine has read to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris a dissertation upon this\nthis subject, which was greatly applauded. But I presume, that the French will be a long time in adopting the practice of inoculation. The clergy there throw a terrible obstacle in its way.\n\nCI. Extract of a Letter from Constantinople, of the 16th September 1754, from Murdock Mackenzie, M.D. concerning the late Earthquake there.\n\nRead Dec. 14, 1754.\n\nOn the 2d instant we had a terrible shock of an earthquake about three-quarters after nine at night, which moved from east to west, and has done a great deal of mischief here, and in the neighbourhood. I shall only mention what I have seen.\n\nFour of the seven towers are much hurt; one of them, which is an octagon, has two of its sides thrown down from top to bottom. It is said several of the Janisaries, who were upon guard there, are killed. The three other of the four are much shatter'd, and part of the walls fallen down. All the turrets upon the city-wall, from the seven towers to the Adrianople-gate, are much shatter'd, though none fallen: all the cupolas of the portico of Sultan Mahomet the II'd's mosque are thrown down: the Sickergee Han, a strong stone building near the above mosque, is quite destroyed: some part of the wall of the Cara Han is thrown down: one bagnio is quite fallen, and many people said to be destroyed in it. The Cautirligee Han is quite down; and the Vizir",
