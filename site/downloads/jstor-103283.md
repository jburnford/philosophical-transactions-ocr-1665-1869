V. An Extract of another Letter from Mr. James Yonge, upon the same subjects as the former.

Honoured Sir,

The Anomalous Blackness of the Girl's Face, of which I sent the History, is now divided into a few dark, cloudy Specks; which appear but seldom, and nothing so livid as formerly.

I am told by a Gentleman Hunter, that he lately found in the Paunch of an Hare, two full grown young Ones among the Bowels; but almost rotten: And three Immature Embryo's in the Uterus. The former were certainly Fetus broke out of the Womb, &c.

Plimouth, Nov. 1.
1709.

Most Worthy Sir,

Yours, &c.

James Yonge.
