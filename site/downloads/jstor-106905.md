These tables are founded on the experiments of which the results were given in the Report and Supplementary Report on the best method of proportioning the excise on spirituous liquors. They are computed for every degree of heat from $30^\circ$ to $80^\circ$, and for the addition or subtraction of every one part in a hundred of water or spirit; but as the experiments themselves were made only to every fifth degree of heat, and every five in the hundred of water or spirit, the intermediate places are filled up by interpolation in the usual manner, with allowance for second differences.

Every table consists of eight columns, and there are two tables for every degree of heat. In the first column of the first of the two tables, are given the proportions of spirit and water by weight, 100 parts of spirit being taken as the constant number, to which additions are made successively of one part of water from 1 to 99 inclusively. The first column in the second table has 100 parts of water for the constant number, with the parts of spirit decreasing successively by unity, from
100 to 1 inclusively. It must be observed, that each of these tables occupying one page, is divided in the middle for adapting it more conveniently to the size of the paper; but the whole of each page is to be considered as one continued table. The second column of all the tables gives the specific gravities of the corresponding mixtures of spirit and water in the first column, taken from the table of specific gravities in the Supplementary Report, the intermediate spaces being filled up by interpolation. In the third column 100 parts by measure of pure spirit, at the temperature marked on the top of every separate table, is assumed as the constant standard number, to which the respective quantities of water by measure, at the same temperature, are to be proportioned in the next column. The fourth column, therefore, contains the proportion of water by measure, to 100 measures of spirit, answering to the proportions by weight in the same horizontal line of the first column. The fifth column shews the number of parts which the quantities of spirit and water contained in the third and fourth columns would measure when the mixture has been completed; that is, the bulk of the whole mixture after the concentration, or mutual penetration, has fully taken place. The sixth column, deduced from the three preceding ones, gives the effect of that concentration, or how much smaller the volume of the whole mixture is, than it would be if there was no such principle as the mutual penetration. The seventh column shews the quantity of pure spirit by measure, at the temperature in the table, contained in 100 measures of the mixture laid down in the fifth column. Lastly, the eighth column gives the decimal multiplier, by means of which the quantity by measure of standard pure spirit, of .825 specific gravity at
60° of heat, may at once be ascertained, the temperature and specific gravity of the liquor being given; pursuant to the idea suggested in the Report, that "the simplest and most equitable method of levying the duty on spirituous liquors would be, to consider rectified spirit as the true and only excisable matter."

It may be proper to add a short account of the method pursued in computing some of the columns of these tables. Columns I. II. and III. require no other explanation than has been already given. Col. IV. is obtained thus: divide the specific gravity of the pure spirit, at the temperature in the table, by the specific gravity of water at the same temperature: then, for the first of the two tables for each degree of heat, the proportion is, as 100 is to the quantity of water by weight in the first column, so is the quotient of the abovementioned division to the quantity of water by measure sought; for the second of the two tables the proportion is, as the quantity of spirit by weight in the first column is to 100, so is that same quotient to the quantity of water by measure sought.

Col. V. requires more calculation. The first step is to compute what the specific gravity of the mixture in question would be if no concentration took place; to obtain which, the constant number 100 (indicating the quantity by measure) of pure spirit, is to be multiplied by the specific gravity of pure spirit at the temperature in the table, and the corresponding measure of water in the fourth column is also to be multiplied by its specific gravity at the given temperature; these two products being added together, their sum is to be divided by the sum of the absolute quantities of spirit and water by measure in the same horizontal line of the third and fourth columns:
then the proportion is, as this quotient (or what the specific gravity would be without concentration) is to the real specific gravity as found in the same horizontal line of the second column of the table, so is the sum of the quantities of spirit and water in the third and fourth columns inversely to the bulk of the mixture.

Col. VI. is obtained by subtracting the real bulk of the mixture in col. V. from the sum of the quantities of spirit and water in col. III. and IV. the difference between them being the diminution occasioned by the concentration on that whole quantity. Col. VII. is obviously to be computed by the following proportion: as the bulk of the whole quantity of the mixture in col. V. is to 100 (the constant quantity), so is 100 to the quantity of pure spirit per cent. at the temperature of the table. Col. VIII. is formed by reducing the volume of the spirit per cent. at the temperature of the table, to its volume at $60^\circ$, by the following proportion: as .825 (the specific gravity of pure spirit at $60^\circ$) is to its specific gravity at the given temperature, so is the number in the seventh column to the volume of pure spirit, at $60^\circ$ of heat, contained in 100 parts by measure of the mixture at the temperature of the table: this divided by 100 is the decimal multiplier sought; the product of which into any measure of a spirituous liquor of the corresponding specific gravity and temperature, will be the true quantity of standard pure spirit, at $60^\circ$ of heat, contained in that liquor.

It may very probably be thought right, for the future use of the revenue, to compute another set of tables, in which the degree of heat standing at the head of each table, the first column of it shall be even numbers of specific gravity. This would be proper for looking out at once the quantities of spirit
and water in a mixture, from its heat and specific gravity, as immediately determined by experiment. For scientific purposes also, tables should be constructed to shew the regular increments and decrements of the concentration, by equal variations in the proportions of spirit and water: but these, and others of a similar nature, which might be suggested, do not belong to the present subject.

Although the titles of the Columns in the preceding Tables, with what has been said in the introductory discourse, may render the Tables sufficiently obvious to the generality of readers, yet to some perhaps an example may be necessary; I shall therefore shew in what manner the quantity by measure of pure Spirit of .825 specific gravity at 60° of heat, may readily be found by the help of these Tables.—In order to which, we must know the heat, the specific gravity, and quantity of spirit which the vessel contains.

**Example.** Suppose the heat to be 35°, the specific gravity .909, and the quantity of spirit 138.99 measures.

Under 35° of heat, and in Column II, of specific gravity, find .909; and in the same horizontal line, take out from Column VIII, the decimal multiplier .7297, by which multiply 138.99, cutting off as many figures to the right as there are decimals in both factors; then we shall have 101,421003 for the measures of pure spirit, of the specific gravity .825 at 60° of heat.

Now a mere inspection of the Columns in the Tables will shew that a spirit of that strength was obtained, by adding 51 parts of water by weight to 100 parts of spirit, as in Column I, which produced the specific gravity found in the same horizontal line, Column II. It will as readily be seen, that the same specific gravity results from adding together their equivalents in measure, Columns III. and IV. and that Column V. contains the quantity, which the two quantities really measure after the mixture has been made.
