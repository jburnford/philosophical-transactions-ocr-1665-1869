  "text": "His spleen was very thick, and his Liver big, and in some places livid. The Heart very dry, and, as 'twere, burnt. And having found the Vein, by which the Transfusion had been made, there was, from the place of the opening of the Arm, to the Heart, almost no blood found in it, no more than in the other Veins, nor in the Ventricles of the Heart, for as much as that little, he received, had been imbibed by his hot and dry Flesh. All which this Author assures, can be attested both by a dozen persons of great veracity, who were present at this dissection, and confirmed by the Certificates given by the Physicians themselves; to be sent to the Parents of the deceased Stranger, who is the very same with him, of whom a less punctual account was given, Numb.28. p. 519.\n\nSome new Experiments\n\nOf injecting Medicated Liquors into Veins, together with the considerable Cures perform'd thereby.\n\nThis was lately communicated in a Letter from Dantzick written by Dr. Fabricius, Physician in Ordinary to that City, which out of the Latin we thus English.\n\nForasmuch as we had a great desire to experiment what would be the effects of the Chirurgery of injecting Liquors into Humane Veins, three fit Subjects presenting themselves in our Hospital, we thought good to make the Tryal upon them. But seeing little ground to hope for a manifest operation from only Altering Medicines, we esteemed, the Experiment would be more convenient and conspicuous from Laxatives, which made us inject by a Syphon about two Drachms of such a kind of Physick into the Median Vein of the right Arm. The Patients were these. One was a lusty robust Souldier dangerously infected with the Venereal Disease, and suffering grievous protuberatings of the bones in his Arms. He, when the purgative Liquor was infused into him, complained of great pains in his Elbows, and the little valves of his Arm did swell so visibly, that it was necessary by a gentle compression of ones fingers to stroke up that swelling towards the Patients shoulders. Some 4 hours after, it began to work, not very troublesome; and so it did the next day, inso-much that the Man had five good stools after it. Without any other\nother remedies those protuberances were gone, nor are there any footsteps left of the abovementioned Disease.\n\nThe two other Trials were made upon the other Sex. A married Woman of 35, and a serving Maid of 20 years of age, had been both of them from their Birth very grievously afflicted with Epileptic fits, so that there was little hopes left to cure them. They both underwent this operation, and there was injected into their Veins a Laxative Rosin, dissolved in an Anti-Epileptical Spirit. The first of these had gentle stools, some hours after the Injection, and the next day the fits recurring now and then, but much milder, are since altogether vanish'd. As for the other, viz. the Maid, she went the same day to stool four times, and several times the next; but by going into the Air, and taking cold, and not observing any diet, cast her self away.\n\n'Tis remarkable, that it was common to all three to vomit soon after the injection, and that extremely and frequently; the reason whereof we leave to intelligent Physicians to assign.\n\nAn Extract\n\nOf a Letter, written from the Bermudas, giving an account of the Course of the Tides there; of Wells both salt and sweet, digg'd near the Sea; of the Whale-fishing there practised anew, and of such Whales as have the Sperma Ceti in them.\n\nThis Letter was written June 18. 1667. by that intelligent Gentleman Mr. Richard Norwood, living upon the place, and relating as follows.\n\nSIR,\n\nI Received your Letter of October 24. 1666. but, whereas you mention another formerly sent, that never came to my hands: Neither had I, before the receipt of yours, the least intelligence of the Institution of the Royal Society, founded by the King; but am very glad, that God hath put into the heart of his Majesty, to advance such a noble Design, and should rejoice, I were able to add my Mite for the furtherance of it. As to the particulars you recommend to me, I shall answer to them, as I can, in the order I find them.\n\nFirst, touching the Conjunction of Mercury with the Sun,",
