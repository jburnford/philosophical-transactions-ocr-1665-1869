III. An uncommon Sinking of the Ground in Kent. Communicated in a Letter to Mr. Peter Collinson.

SIR,

IT is within this three or four Days, that I have first been able to get a more particular Account of the sinking of the Lands at Lymne in Kent, and even now, perhaps, it will be but an imperfect one.

It is now about two Years since it happened, and was the Consequence of a very wet Season, when the Waters, that had fallen on the Up lands, and were not carried off by Drains, soaked into the Ground in such Quantities as to form a quick Sand at some considerable Depth in the Earth (at least this is what we look on to have caused the Phænomenon) which not being able to bear the Weight upon it, broke out at the Side of the Hill,

\(d\) the flat Land at Top, stiff Ground and rocky.
* The Place of the Farm at present, which not only sunk down from \(d\) 40 or 50 Foot, but was also moved somewhat towards \(a\).
