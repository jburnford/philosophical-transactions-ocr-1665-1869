XI. Extract of a Letter from the Rev. John Brinkley, D.D.
F.R.S. Andrew's Professor of Astronomy in the University of
Dublin, to the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne, D.D. F.R.S. Astro-
nomer Royal, on the annual Parallax of α Lyrae.

Read April 12, 1810.

I have now had sufficient experience of my eight feet circle,
to be highly satisfied with it, and have arrived at one con-
clusion, that it is of importance in astronomy.

My observations on α Lyrae for the purpose of discovering
an annual parallax now amount to 47 in number, viz. 22 near
opposition, and 25 near conjunction, and the mean of these
gives a result of 2,"52 as the parallax of the annual orbit for
that star, and I have no doubt that it exceeds 2".

My observations of different circumpolar stars, and of the
same star in different states of the thermometer, seem to re-
quire a small alteration in the numbers of Dr. Bradley's
formula for refraction.

The formula so altered is

\[ \text{Refraction} = 56,"9 \times \text{tang.} \left\{ \frac{\text{Zen. dis.} - 3.2 \text{ Refr.}}{29.6} \right\} \times \frac{500}{450 + \text{ther.}} \]

By means of this formula, the observations of circumpolar stars
considerably distant, give the same co-latitude to a great de-
gree of exactness.
