The numbers shew the proportion of gravity of equal portions of these bodys: but if of these bodys we take portions equally heavy, their magnitudes will\nwill be reciprocally proportional to their correspondent numbers. e.g., a cubic foot of water is to a cubic foot of Alabaster in gravity as 1000 to 1872; but a pound weight of water, is to a pound weight Alabaster in magnitude, as 1872 to 1000. So that knowing by the former table, the weight of a cubic foot of water, and by this, the proportion in gravity betwixt water and Alabaster; we may by the rule of 3 find the weight of a cubic foot of Alabaster, and so of any other of these bodys; or we may know their magnitude by knowing their gravity. So that an irregular piece or quantity of these bodys being offered, 'tis but weighing them, and we may know their just magnitude without farther trouble.",
