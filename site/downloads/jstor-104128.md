I. Extract of a Letter from Mr. Christopher Mason, concerning a Fire-ball seen in the Air, and a great Explosion heard, Dec. 11. 1741.

Read at a Meeting of the Royal Society, on January 7. 1741-2.

Several People saw a Ball of Fire, which ran nearly Eastward, leaving a Train of Light, which continued some time. The Ball of Fire was seen, and the Report heard very loud, at Sompting, beyond Shoreham. Although I had been gazing upon the black Cloud for some Minutes, yet I saw no Fire nor Lightning. I am, &c.

Dec. 28. 1741.
