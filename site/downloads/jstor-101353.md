In the description of all which Mines our Author delivers very particularly not only the situation, depth, dams, waters, quantities, goodness and richness of ore; but also the wayes used by the Inhabitants of reducing their Ores into Metals, &c. All which would be too large to particularise in this place.

6. Of the many natural Hot-baths of Hungary, as at Banca, Glas- hitten, Eisenbach, Stubn, Boinitz.

7. Of the considerable Baths of Austria, especially those at Baden, 4 German miles from Vienna; described, at large also from our Authors communications, in Numb. 59. of these Tracts.

8. Of a Strange Lake of Zirchnitz in Carniola, very curiously described.

10. Of a stony excrescence upon the Liver of wild Goats, highly commended in Germany for a signal remedy against malignant diseases and the Plague.

For the particular description of all which, and many more, we must refer the curious Reader to the Book itself.
