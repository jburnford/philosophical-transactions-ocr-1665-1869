At $7^h\\ 26'45''$ Venus appeared to me in contact with the Sun, and about $6''$ after I saw the Sun's limb compleated.\n\nThe clock could be depended on to less than one second, having been compared with a number of equal altitudes of the Sun, some days before and after the transit.\n\nAlexander Aubert.\n\nLII.
