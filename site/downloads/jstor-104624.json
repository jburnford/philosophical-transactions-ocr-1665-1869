S. on the Electricity of Glass, that has been exposed to strong Fires.\n\nDated March 23, 1749.\n\n* * *\n\nRead April 6. It seems to me that a Glass Ball, which has oftentimes been employed for violent Distillations, and other chymical Operations, does send forth the Electricity incomparably more strong than any other Glass, which never since its making had been exposed to a violent Fire. As I am the first that has mentioned this notable Circumstance, be pleased to let me have the Honour of this Improvement in the Philosophical Transactions.\n\n* * *",
