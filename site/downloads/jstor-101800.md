Extract of a Letter sent from Genoa to Sign. Sarotti, the Venetian Resident here, and by him communicated to the Honourable Mr. Boyle.

On St. Joseph's day, upon the Mountains call'd Le Langhe, there fell upon the white Snow, that was there already, a great quantity of red, or if you please of bloody Snow. From which, being squeezed, there came a water of the same colour. Of this there are here many Eye Witnesses.

Anatomical Observations of the Structure of the Nose: made by Mons. du Vernay. Taken out of the Journal des Scavans.

An account is here given of a Book entitled, Philosophia Vetus & Nova. The Learned Author whereof hath collected and composed together into one Systeme a great number of excellent Observations; amongst the rest of which, here briefly mention'd, we have this, nowhere else published that I know of, set down at large, as follows.

Of the Structure of the Nose, Mons. du Vernay observes, That the cavities hereof are fill'd with many Cartilaginous Lamines distinct one from another: every Lamine being divided into many others, all folded almost into a spiral line. That the Os Cribrosum is made up of the extremities of these Lamines, which butt upon the Root of the Nose; the holes wherewith it is pierced, being the intervals between the Lamines.

They are designed to uphold the inner Tunick of the Nose. Which Tunick, being a principal Organ of Smelling, hath received from Nature a very great expansion: for the commodious placing whereof, Nature hath folded it round about together with these Lamines; that by this industrious Mechanism, she may employ all its length in a very little room.

This Tunick is fill'd with an innumerable company of small Rays; so many branches of Arteries and Veins; and especially Nerves; by which it hath a most exquisite sense. Yet because the particles of Odorant bodies are so subtil, that they can but very softly glance upon the Organ; Nature hath therefore provided by this great expansion, that there
there may be place for so much the greater number of these particles to strike it at the same time, and so to render their impression more strong.

And that these odorant particles, which run with the Air into the Nose, in smelling, might not all forthwith pass off from thence into the breast: Nature by this Labyrinth, made by the windings of the Lamelle, hath taken care to give them an arrest and longer stay. And for the same reason, she hath furnished the said Tunick of the Nose with a great many small Glands, which open thereinto; and so moisten it with a thick and slimy exudation, the better to entangle the dry odorant particles.

This Tunick examined and compar'd in several Animals, shews also much of the reason of the delicacy of Smelling in some, above what it is in others. For look how much a finer Nose it is that Animals have, they have likewise so much a greater number of these Lamelle, wherewith the said Tunick is roll'd up in so many more folds. So the Nose of a Hound is better furnished with them, than that of any other Animals. The Hare, Fox, Cat, Wild Boar, have a considerable number of them. Those Animals that chew the Cud, have fewer. And Man is less provided for, than any of the rest. Thus far the Learned Observer.

And Note, That not only the number, but also the length of the Lamelle, is of great use for the strength of Smelling. For which purpose most Quadrupeds, which either hunt, as the Carnivorous; or at least want reason otherwise to distinguish their food, than by the smell, as the Graminivorous; have their Nose not placed in the middle of the face, as in Man; but prolonged to the very end.

In Brazil, there are certain little Animals, by the Author call'd Poux de Pharaon, which enter into the feet betwixt the skin and the flesh. They grow in one day as big as Beans. And if they are not presently drawn out, they make
