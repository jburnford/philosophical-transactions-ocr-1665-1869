  "text": "IX. An Excretory Duct from the Glandula Renalis. Extracted from the Giornale di Litterati of Venice, for the Year 1719.\n\nThe celebrated Anatomist, Signor Anton Maria Valsalva, already known by his noble Treatise De Aure humana, has lately made a considerable Discovery. He has found the excretory Ducts of the Glandulae Rennales, or, Renes Succenturiati, which discharge themselves into the Parts of Generation; that is to say, into the Epididymides in Men, and into the Ovaria in Women. He has read a learned Dissertation relating to this Discovery, before the Academy of Sciences in Bologna, in which he undertakes to prove, that those Renes succenturiati, are to be reckon'd among the principal Organs of Generation. He is soon to publish it in Print, but the Publication of the Cuts belonging to it, will be retarded, because the engraving of them, cannot be finish'd in so short a time.\n\nWe have since learn'd the disagreeable News of the Death of this very learned and inquisitive Anatomist; but, as his Reputation, and known Accuracy in dissecting, leaves no room to doubt of the reality of the abovemention'd Discovery, we hope it will be prosecuted by other curious Persons.",
