I had carefully adjusted my clock to the apparent time, by correspondent altitudes of the Sun, taken with the quadrant for several days before, and with the same reflecting telescope as I used for the transit of Venus*. I first perceived the little planet making an impression on the Sun's limb at $2^h\\ 52'\\ 41''$; and he appeared wholly within at $53'\\ 58''$ apparent time. The sun set before the planet reached the middle of his course; and for a con-\n\n* See Phil. Transact.

So that I made\nno observations of consequence except that of the\nbeginning, at which time the Sun was perfectly\nclear. This transit compleats three periods of\n46 years, since the first observation of Gassendi at\nParis, in 1631.\"\n\nI am, SIR,\n\nWith great esteem,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nB. Franklin.\n\nIV. Obser-",
