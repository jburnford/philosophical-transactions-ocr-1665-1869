Boyle, Sir Rob. Moray, and Mr. Henry Powle, for concurring in this Work; the first, having undertaken to recommend Observations of this nature, to be made, upon the Western Coast of Ireland*, the second, upon the West of Scotland; and the third, in the Isle of Lundy; to whom we must add the inquisitive Mr. Sam. Colepresse, for Plymouth, and the Lands-end. Besides, we hope to engage the curious of France in the same undertaking, especially for procuring, besides what is known already concerning that place, a very particular and exact account of the Tydes upon the Coast of Britany, where (especially about St. Malo) they are found to rise to admiration, even to 60, 70, and sometime 80 feet, at the New and Full Moon.\n\n* The Observations particularly recommended for that Coast, are these:\n\n1. At what hour it is High-water on the day of the New and Full Moon, upon every Cape and Bay of the Western Coast of Ireland.\n2. How long after the New and Full Moon the highest Spring-tides fall out.\n3. What are the perpendicular heights of the Flood, both at the ordinary, and the Spring-tydes.\n\nSome Suggestions\nFor Remedies against Cold.\n\nAs there have been Remedies found out against excessive Heat, and Means of cooling Meat and Drink; so it was lately, on the occasion of the sharp Season, suggested, That Remedies might be thought on against Cold; and that particularly it might be inquired into,\n\n1. What things in Nature, or by Art, or Mechanical contrivance will retain a warming Heat longest, or a melting or scorching Heat?\n2. What will continue or maintain Fire longest?\n\nSome that observe common practices and vulgar Trades, take notice, That Foyners use Leaden-Pots for their Glue, alleging for a Reason, That Lead, being a close Metal, retains the heat longer\nlonger than other Metals. Cary's Warming-stone promised a warmth for six or eight hours; if it performed but for two or three hours, it would be of great use. 'Tis found by sad experience, how hurtful Bright Fires, and especially of Stone-coal are to the Eyes.\n\nTo retain Fire long, certain Black Earths are useful, as we were newly informed by the Inquisitive Dr. B. That a Gentleman in Sommertsetshire, called Mr. Speke, had bountifully obliged Ilminster, and his Neighborhood, by a Black Fat-Earth lately found in his Park. But the same Correspondent adds, That he never saw any parallel to a Sea-weed, which he and some of his Fellow-Students had in Cambridge in the mouth of a Barrel of good Oysters. It was smaller than Pease-halm, yet cut, it lasted two very great Fires of Sea-coal, burning bright in the midst of the Fire; and by a stroak of the Tongues, it fell into the Hearth, jingling like Metal.\n\nA Relation\n\nOf an uncommon Accident in two Aged Persons.\n\nThis was imparted by the above-mentioned Mr. Colepresse, who affirms in his Letter, containing this Account, That the matter of fact was thoroughly examined by himself, and that he was fully, and in all respects, satisfied of the truth thereof.\n\nThe Relation of the one, is in these words.\n\nJoseph Shute Clerk, Parson of Mary (nigh Plymouth) in the County of Devon, aged 81 years, being a temperate man, and of an healthy constitution, having the in-most Grinder loose, and so remaining, perceived, that his mouth, about three Months since, was somewhat straightened; and upon inquiry into the cause of it, found, That he had a new Tooth (the third Grinder) being the innermost of the upper Jaw in the Right Cheek, which still remains firm.\n\nThe Account of the other follows thus.\n\nMaria Stert of Benecliffe, in Plympton St. Mary (near Plymouth) in Devon, aged about 75 years, an healthy person, having had nine children, about the fortieth year of her age lost three of her upper",
