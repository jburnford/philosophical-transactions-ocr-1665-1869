  "text": "V. On the Reflexion of Polarized Light from Polished Surfaces, Transparent and Metallic.\n\nBy the Rev. Samuel Haughton, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nReceived June 9,—Read June 19, 1862.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nAmong the experimenters who have made the reflexion of polarized light the object of their researches, there is no one to whom science is more indebted than to M. Jamin, whose accurate observations are a model for subsequent observers. His first paper on this subject was published (1847) in the 19th volume of the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique,' 3rd series, p. 296, on Metallic Reflexion.\n\nIn this remarkable paper M. Jamin verified many of the previous observations of Brewster, and added many of his own. He employed two distinct methods in these experiments,—\n1st. The method of Comparative Intensities—by observing the relative intensities of the same beam of light reflected from a polished surface, composed partly of glass and partly of the substance to be examined.\n2nd. The method of Multiple Reflexions, previously known from the researches of Brewster.\n\nThe optical constants used by Jamin in this paper are—\n(a) The angle ($i_1$) of maximum polarization.\n(b) The angle (A) whose tangent is the ratio of I to J, the square roots of the intensities reflected in the plane of incidence, and in the perpendicular plane.\n(c) The coefficient ($\\varepsilon$) used by Cauchy, which is connected with the other two constants by means of theoretical equations.\n\nBy the first method of observation, M. Jamin determines the constants $i_1$ and $\\varepsilon$ for the following substances:—\n1. Steel,\n2. Speculum metal;\nand by the second method of observation, he determines $i_1$ and A for\n3. Silver,\nand $i_1$ for\n4. Zinc,\nand gives the details of experiments on\n5. Copper,\nfrom which the optical constants may be found.\n\nMDCCCLXIII.\nM. Jamin's next paper on Metallic Reflexion appeared in 1848, in the Annales de Chim. et de Phys. 3rd series, vol. xxii. p. 311. In this paper he makes use of the second method of observation, by multiple reflexion, and gives valuable tables of the results of his experiments with the various colours of the spectrum on the seven following metallic substances:\n\n1. Steel.\n2. Speculum metal.\n3. Silver.\n4. Zinc.\n5. Copper.\n6. Brass.\n7. Bell metal.\n\nFrom these Tables the constants \\( i \\) and \\( A \\) may be inferred.\n\nIn 1850 M. Jamin published his well known paper \"On the Reflexion of Light at the Surface of Transparent Bodies,\" in the Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. 3rd series, vol. xxix. p. 263. In this series of experiments he used a new method of observation, founded on the Quartz Compensator of Babinet. In this elaborate and important paper he publishes the details of his experiments on the following substances:\n\n1. Fire Opal,\n2. Hyalite,\n3. Realgar,\n4. Blende,\n5. Diamond,\n6. Fluor-spar,\n7, 8. Two kinds of glass,\n\nand, in addition, gives in a Table at the end of the paper the constants of many other transparent bodies.\n\nM. Jamin has also published, in 1851, in the Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. vol. xxxi. p. 165, a memoir \"On the Reflexion of Light at the Surface of Liquids,\" in which he determines the optical constants of many liquids.\n\nIt occurred to me that the method of observation employed by Jamin for transparent bodies might be advantageously used in the case of metals; and I was thus led to commence the series of experiments the results of which are recorded in the following pages.\n\nIn these experiments I have added many metallic substances to Jamin's list, and have re-examined the metals observed by him by a different method.\n\nIn transparent bodies I have examined a few not experimented on by Jamin, and investigated in detail the form of the reflected ellipse, under varying conditions of incidence and azimuth.\n\nIn the course of my paper I have employed for the second optical constant one more\nreadily determined than those usually employed, but which is readily deduced from the constants $A$ and $k$ of Jamin.\n\nAt the close of the paper I shall give a Table containing a comparison of the constants found by Jamin and myself for all the bodies which we have both examined.\n\nSome years ago, in making observations on polarized light, I found that by adjusting properly the azimuth of the incident polarized beam, and allowing it to fall at the angle of principal incidence, I could obtain a reflected beam of circularly polarized light.\n\nOn repeating the experiment with different polished surfaces, I found that the coefficient of reflexion, or whatever property it is that gives a surface a metallic reflexion, might be conveniently expressed by the cotangent of the azimuth at which an incident beam of plane-polarized light should be placed so as to give, on reflexion at the principal incidence, a reflected beam of circularly polarized light.\n\nThe following paper contains an account of my experiments on many substances, and a Table of their Coefficients of Reflexion and Refraction, determined with as much accuracy as I was able to attain with the instruments at my disposal.\n\nThe apparatus used by me consisted of a large graduated circle (horizontal), provided with two moveable arms, each furnished with graduated circles (vertical); and the large horizontal circle was capable of being hung vertically, so as to allow of experiments being made on liquids as well as solids. The substance to be examined was placed on a stage provided with adjusting screws, so as to bring the surface exactly into the centre, or intersection of the axes of the polarizing and analysing arms. These arms were mounted with Nicol prisms, made for me by Duboscq of Paris, and without sensible deviation. The light employed was generally sunlight, but I sometimes used a moderator lamp with colza oil.\n\nI employed the quartz compensator described by M. Jamin*, for the purpose of converting the elliptically polarized reflected light into plane-polarized light, before allowing it to pass through the analyser.\n\nThe instrument used by me in making my observations on the reflexion of polarized light, was made by Mr. Grubb of Dublin for the late Professor McCullagh, and was presented to me, shortly after McCullagh's death, by his brother. It is substantially the same as that described by M. Jamin in vol. xxix. Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. sér. 3. I procured from M. Duboscq Soleil, of Paris, a compensator of Jamin's pattern, and had it adapted to my own apparatus.\n\nIn making my observations I used the following precautions:\n\n1. The zero of both polarizer and analyser was determined by direct observation with red sunlight, reflected at the angle of polarization of several glasses found to give a reflected beam capable of being completely cut off by the Nicol prism.\n\n2. The Nicol prisms themselves were carefully tested and found to have no deviation.\n\n3. Each of my recorded observations is the mean of four or five; and when these differed from each other by more than 20', I took the precaution of repeating them.\n\n* Annales de Chimie et de Physique, sér. 3. vol. xxix. p. 263 et seq.\nagain, on another day, with my eye fresh and unfatigued, before I finally adopted my mean.\n\n4. I frequently repeated the observations, with the incident light polarized at an equal angle, at the opposite side of the plane of incidence; and also reversing the polarizer and analyser, so as to read the opposite sides of their scales.\n\nThe following definitions will explain the sense in which I use certain terms.\n\nThe Azimuth of a beam of plane-polarized light is the angle which its plane of polarization makes with the plane of incidence.\n\nThe Index of Refraction is the ratio which the sine of the angle of incidence bears to the sine of the angle of refraction.\n\nThe Coefficient of Refraction is the tangent of the Principal Incidence.\n\nThe Principal Incidence is that angle of incidence at which rays polarized in any azimuth have the major axis of the reflected elliptic light in the plane of incidence; or at which the components of the reflected beam, in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, differ by $90^\\circ$ in phase.\n\nThis angle is nearly the same as Brewster's Angle of Polarization or Maximum Polarization.\n\nThe Coefficient of Reflexion is the Cotangent of the Azimuth of an incident beam of plane-polarized light, which after reflexion at the principal incidence becomes circularly polarized.\n\nThe Principal Components of the incident and reflected light are the components in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence.\n\nThe following preliminary investigation will serve to show the principles on which I have tabulated the results of my experiments:\n\nLet the elliptically polarized reflected beam be represented, as in the annexed figure, inscribed in a rectangle, whose sides are parallel to OI and OP, the plane of incidence and perpendicular plane.\n\nLet Ox be the diagonal of the circumscribed rectangle, and Oy the axis of the ellipse; it is required, from the difference of phase of the light in the planes OI and OP, and knowing the direction of the line Ox, to find the direction of Oy and the ratio of the axes of the ellipse.\n\nThe angle $xOI = \\alpha'$ is the azimuth of the reflected beam, measured by the analyser, after it has lost its elliptic polarization in the compensator; and the difference of phase of OI and OP is measured in the compensator itself, by the displacement necessary to reduce the elliptically-polarized to plane-polarized light.\n\nWe may imagine, to aid our conception, but without hypothesis, that a material point traverses the ellipse, and that its coordinates are\n\n$$\\xi = A \\sin (kt + e),$$\n\n$$\\eta = B \\sin (kt + e'),$$\n\nwhere $e' - e$ is the difference of phase between the beams OI and OP, and A, B are the lines OI and OP.\nEliminating $t$, we find\n\n$$\\frac{\\xi^2}{A^2} + \\frac{\\eta^2}{B^2} - 2 \\cos(\\epsilon' - \\epsilon) \\frac{\\xi \\eta}{AB} = \\sin^2(\\epsilon' - \\epsilon). \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (1.)$$\n\nIn this ellipse, the angle $\\phi$ made by the axis with the plane of incidence is found from the well-known expression\n\n$$\\tan 2\\phi = \\frac{2E}{D-F},$$\n\nbelonging to the ellipse\n\n$$Dx^2 + 2Exy + Fy^2 = \\text{const.}$$\n\nSubstituting for $D$, $E$, $F$ their values from (1.), we find\n\n$$\\tan 2\\phi = \\tan 2\\alpha' \\cos(\\epsilon' - \\epsilon); \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (2.)$$\n\n$\\phi$ denoting the angle $yOI$, and $\\alpha'$ the angle $xOI$. But if $a$ and $b$ denote the axes of the ellipse, it can be proved that\n\n$$\\frac{b^2}{a^2} = \\frac{(D+F) + (D-F) \\sec 2\\phi}{(D+F) - (D-F) \\sec 2\\phi},$$\n\nor substituting from (1.) and (2.),\n\n$$\\frac{a}{b} = \\sqrt{-\\cot(\\phi + \\alpha') \\cot(\\phi - \\alpha')} \\quad \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots (3.)$$\n\nFrom equations (2.) and (3.), I calculate the position of the elliptic axes and their ratio.\n\nThe angle $\\alpha'$ is obtained by direct measurement with the analysing prism; and $\\epsilon' - \\epsilon$ may be found, as follows, from the compensator.\n\nIn the compensator made for me by M. Duboscq, I find that 39·43 represents the zero, i.e. the position in which the compensator affects equally the light in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence; the number of graduations corresponding to a difference of half a wave (180°) I found to be\n\nRed lamplight (colza oil) . . . . 15·43\nRed sunlight . . . . . . . . . . 15·37\nWhite lamplight (colza oil) . . . . 13·29\n\nIf, therefore, $C$ denote the reading of the compensator in any experiment, the difference of phase of the two principal beams will be expressed for red sunlight, in degrees, by the expression\n\n$$(C - 39·43) \\times \\frac{180°}{15·37},$$\n\nand by a corresponding formula for the other kinds of light.\n\nThe angle thus measured by the compensator is not the difference of phase between the principal components of the reflected light until it is increased by 180°, because experiment shows that in the act of reflexion there is this constant difference between\nthe two components, in addition to the varying difference of phase, depending on incidence, azimuth, and nature of polished surface. We therefore use the formula\n\n\\[ e' - e = 180^\\circ + \\left( C - 39.43 \\right) \\times \\frac{180^\\circ}{i} \\]  \n\nwhere \\( i \\) denotes the interval corresponding to 180° for the light used.\n\nIn tabulating my experiments, I give the original measurements of the analyser and compensator, and use the equations (2.), (3.), and (4.) to calculate the other columns.\n\nI.

I have four rhombs made of it, whose index of refraction I determined by the following experiments:\n\n| Rhomb. | Angle | Minimum deviation* of red light | Refractive index |\n|--------|-------|---------------------------------|------------------|\n| No. 1. | 44° 56' 6\" | 31° 43' 30\" | 1.6229 |\n| No. 2. | 54° 28' 30\" | 41° 28' 0\" | 1.6230 |\n| No. 3. | 39° 50' 0\" | 27° 17' 0\" | 1.6227 |\n| No. 4. | 59° 58' 30\" | 48° 22' 0\" | 1.6221 |\n\nMean ...... 1.6227\n\nCalculated Angle of Polarization = 58° 21'.\n\nI also found the refractive indices of No. 2 for the extreme red and violet rays to be 1.6190 and 1.6555, which indicates a dispersive power in the glass of 0.0573.\n\nThis glass was found to contain the following constituents:\n\n- Silica . . . . . . . . 42.25\n- Oxide of Lead . . . . 46.35\n- Lime . . . . . . . . 0.45\n- Alkalies (by diff.) . . 10.95\n\nTotal 100.00\n\nThe following Tables contain my observations on this glass:\n\n* In all my experiments the red light used was passed through the same piece of red glass, which was very homogeneous.\nTABLE II.—Munich Glass (a).

This is shown in Plate VIII. fig. A, on which the values of $\\phi$ are laid down for different angles of incidence in the two cases in which the azimuth of the incident light is 80° and 87°.\n\nWhen the azimuth of the incident light is less than $\\lambda$, the circular limit, the axis of the ellipse moves as in the annexed figure. Let POA be the azimuth of the incident light, and QOA equal to POA; PO is the position of the axis major corresponding to 0° incidence; OA is the position of the axis major in the plane of incidence, corresponding to the principal incidence; and OQ is the position of the axis corresponding to 90° incidence.\n\nWhen, however, the azimuth of the incident light is greater than the circular limit, the axis major moves from P to x, as in the annexed figure, then back from x to y, passing through B at the principal incidence, and finally from y to Q. Let POA be the azimuth of the incident light, and QOB equal to POB. At the incidence 0°, OP is the position of the axis major; as the incidence increases from 0° to the principal incidence, the axis major moves from OP to Ox and turns back, attaining the position OB at the principal incidence; and as the incident angle increases from the principal incidence to 90°, the axis major moves from OB to Oy, and back again to OQ.\n\nHaving ascertained the truth of the preceding laws of the movement of the axis major of the elliptically polarized light, I made the following experiments. Having removed\nthe compensator, I set the polarizer at 88° and 89°, and found that the analyser gave a minimum of light at 90°, showing that the axis major of the ellipse was perpendicular to the plane of incidence.\n\nAll the experiments already given were made with the Munich glass (a) No. 1. I made the following experiment with (a) No. 2, in order to establish fully the identity of the pieces of glass with regard to reflexion, as they are certainly identical in their refractive indices.\n\n**Table XI.—Munich Glass (a).

This quality might be provisionally named **lustre**.\n\nIt is very remarkable that gold, silver, and copper, which from time immemorial have pleased the eye of man, and been used as coins, should head the list of bodies possessing a high coefficient of reflexion. Mercury, which has so brilliant a surface, and therefore heads the list in Table LXXXII., occupies a comparatively low place in Table LXXXIII., probably owing to its being a liquid, and its surface, therefore, in a less favourable condition than that of a solid for imparting elliptic polarization to an incident beam.\n\nM. Jamin has examined optically several of the substances mentioned in the preceding\nTables—the metallic bodies by the methods of equal intensities and multiple reflexions, and the transparent bodies by the method employed in this paper, and originally used by him.\n\nI have deduced from his original observations, the optical constants of the substances common to him and myself, and have recorded them for the purpose of comparison, in the two following Tables, LXXXIV. and LXXXV.*\n\n**Table LXXXIV.—Optical Constants of Metals, deduced from Jamin’s experiments.**\n\n| Substance                  | Principal Incidence | Circular Limit | Coefficient of Refraction | Coefficient of Reflection |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Steel (1)                  | 76° 6               | 59° 6          | 4·0108                    | 0·5985                   |\n| Steel (2)                  | 77° 4               | 61° 27         | 4·3546                    | 0·5441                   |\n| I.
