Since the Leaves have been explicated, we have observ'd the Sycamore after several frosty nights to bleed afresh in the morning, soon after Sun-rising, when it had ceased several days before: though this must not be understood of all Sycamores, but of some only that are more sensible and observant of the Weather.\n\nApril 3d. and 4th, all the Sycamores quite ceased.\n\nThe 5th, being after a white frost, they began to bleed about 8 o'clock, and ceased towards noon.\n\nThe 9th, 12th, 13th, 15th they bled again.\n\nThe 10th, 11th, 14th were not observed.\n\nThis 16th they bled not, it being rainy, and the Sun not shining.\n\nFrom the Observations we have hitherto made, we think it may be certainly inferred, that a morning-sun after a frost will make all the Bleeding Tribe bleed afresh, though they had before ceased; and that this new bleeding towards the latter end of the season commonly ceaseth before morning. Possibly some may bleed after a frost, yet further in the Summer.\n\nI observed last year in August a copious and spontaneous exudation, very like bleeding, of a viscous yellow Juice out of the buds of a black Poplar. Our Walnut-trees bleed here in January.\n\nThe Starre-fish, in the last Transactions, is the Stella arboreaens Rondeletii p. 121. first described by him, and since by other Naturalists.\n\nThere is no such dwarf-Oak in Old England, growing wild, as was sent you out of New-England, nor in any other Country, where we have been, unless it be the Ilex coccifera, which is a low shrub, bearing large Acorns, and hath a prickly leaf like Holly. If it prove that, it will be a luciferous discovery. —— Middleton in Warwickshire April 16. 1670.\n\nAn Account of some Books.\n\nI. Joh. Sig. Elsholtii, Elector Brandenburg Medici, CLYSMATICA NOVA, sive Ratio in venam sellam Medicamenta immittendi. COLONIE BRANDEBURGICÆ. 1667. in 8°.\n\nThe Title-page of this Book, but very lately come into England, shews this to be the second Edition: and the Author in the Conclusion of it tells the Reader, that the first Edition thereof was publick A. 1665. at which time he affirms there had been nothing printed (for ought he knew) either by English, French, or Italians, of this argument. To which we shall here say nothing, but refer the Candid Reader to what hath been laid already (by way of vindicating the Invention, both of Infusing Medical Liquors, and of Transfusing Blood, from usurpation)\npation) in several of these Tracts, as Numb. 7. p. 123. Numb. 20. 353\nNumb. 22. p. 385. Numb. 35. p. 677, 678, 679, 680, 681.\n\nMeantime, this Author, having collected in this little Tract divers of\nthe Experiments, made in England, France, and Italy, concerning these\nInventions (of which we might have a far greater stock, and that a very\nconsiderable one, as to that of Infusion, if our Learned and Candid Do-\nctor Timothy Clark, one of his Majesties Physicians in Ordinary, and\na Fellow of the R. Society, could but find the leisure of digesting for the\nPress what he hath done on this subject many years ago) discourseth of\nthe particular Diseases, wherein this Infusing Chirurgery hath been used\nwith success, and suggests those, to which it might be further extended\nwith benefit.\n\nII. Nicolai Hobokeni ANATOMIA SECUNDINÆ HUMA-\nNÆ, Ultrajetti A. 1669. in 8°.\n\nThis Author, intending to inquire more narrowly into all the parti-\nculars concerning Humane Generation, premiseth these Observations,\ntouching the Humane Secundine, lately made by himself, and accompa-\nnied with 15 accurate Schemes, drawn, (as he faith) by his own hand,\nand representing;\n\nFirst, in a Female Fetus, the placenta uteri, together with the Mem-\nbranes and String, on both sides, where the same respects the uterus as well\nas the fetus; and more particularly the Membrane Amnios, sever'd from\nthe placenta, and the Vessels running through the other Membrane,\nChorion; then, that portion of the string, wherein the laxeness, inequa-\nlities and contorsions of the Membrane, together with all the contain'd\nvessels in their proper situation, are observ'd; next, the Macula, ap-\npearing somewhat prominent in one of the Arteries, by which may easily\nbe found the passage of the Blood to the Placenta, and its difficult re-\ngress towards the Navel of the Fetus; moreover, the interior substance\nof the placenta, and all the ramifications of the Veins and Arteries.\n\nSecondly, in a Male-fetus, a review of all the former particulars, toge-\nther with several differences from that of the Female.\n\nTo these Observations is subjoyn'd a Collection of Letters, written by\nthis Author to divers Learned men, touching Generation, together with\ntheir Answers: in which Collection 'tis intimated, that the Curious may\nnow expect from Dr. Dimerbroeck, the famous Physitian of Utrecht, his\nAnatomy, which by reason of his great practice, and a multitude of other\navocations hath been hitherto retarded.\n\nJoh.\nIII. Joh. Ludov. Gansii M.D. CORALLIORUM HISTO-\nRIA. Francofurti A. 1669. in 12°.\n\nIn this History the Author affirms to have digested both what hath been delivered of Corals, and what himself hath observ'd and try'd of that curious product of Nature, taken notice of by the Poet, 4. Metam.\n\nSic & Coralium, quo primum contigit auras\nTempore, durescit, mollis frui herba sub undis.\n\nWhich affirmation this Author looks upon as poetical indeed and fictitious, asserting, that Coral is originally a Mineral, and a kind of precious Stone, Corals being no berries petrified, but pieces filed off and turn'd, from the trunk, round and polish't.\n\nHis opinion therefore is, that Coral is form'd out of a glutinous Juice, which being turn'd into Stone by a salt, abounding in it, riseth up in the form of a Shrub, the salt being the cause, that maketh Plants spread into branches.\n\nThe places of the production of Coral he names to be, the Red Sea (where they are darkish,) the Persian Gulf, the Sicilian and Neapolitan shore. Some of them are Red, others White, others Blackish.\n\nTo this Account he annexes various Preparations made of them; as also divers Solutions, of which he delivers one as an excellent dissolvent both of Corals and Pearls, made of very well rectify'd spirit of Salt, digest'd, and freed of its Corrosiveness, and then mixt with good spirit of Wine distill'd and brought over the Alembic. May-Dew is also much commended by him for a fit Menstruum, if the spirits distill'd from it be joyn'd with its own Salt.\n\nHe treats also of the Magisteries, Extract, Oyl, Tincture, Quintessence, Flowers; as also of the Vertues of Corals, and of the way of making factitious ones.\n\nERRATA, left uncorrected in some of the former Tracts\n\nIn No. 54. p. 1082. l. 14. r. 4000. ib. l. 32. r.
