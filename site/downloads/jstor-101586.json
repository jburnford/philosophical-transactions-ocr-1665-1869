  "text": "So far the first communication concerning this matter: In which occurring several particulars, requiring further Information, and they being sent to the Author, he was pleased to return what follows.\n\n'Tis so far, that the Rape is put into any place to sour before it be cast into the Vinegar-vessels, that as soon as 'tis separated from its Grapes (which is done immediately after Vintage,) it is carefully put up in Barrels, least it take Air; without which it would heat itself, and be spoyled.\n\nThere is no other way of keeping the Rape that hath once served already, than to drown it; that is to say, to fill the Vessel wherein it is, with Wine or Vinegar. Rape will serve a year, more or less, provided that care be taken of cleaning every morning, with a piece of Linnen, the grease that is on the sides of the Vessel, and with a little broom, that which swims on the top of the liquor. The Rape may be freed from its grease with water, rubbing it between ones hands.\n\nNo body, that I know, hath hitherto examin'd what this Grease is. When I can get a fit quantity of it, I will endeavour to make some Experiments about it; especially if I be assisted with Suggestions for making proper ones.\n\nI have been lately inform'd, that there have been Merchants here, who made Vinegar with phlegme of Wine, remaining after that the Aqua vita is extracted from it.",
