which Saturn is at this Time very near, and after the same Method I settled its Place, ineunte Anno 1690, (the Epoch of the British Catalogue) in $29^\circ 34'$ of Scorpio with $2^\circ 0' \frac{1}{2}$, North Latitude. By this it will appear, how defective the observed Place of Saturn is stated in Riccioli, there being above seven Minutes erred in the Latitude thereof.

II. Observation of a Parhelion, Oct. 26th, 1721. By the same.

This Morning, 26th of October, being on the River coming up to London, about half an Hour past Ten, the Sun being then about twenty Degrees high, I observed a Circle about the Sun, which is by no means unusual, when the Air in chilly Weather, such as it is now, is replete with snowy Particles; which Circle was of the Size it always appears in, about 23 Degrees from the Sun, and faintly ting'd with the Colours of the Iris. When this Circle happens, I always look out, to see whether any other of the Phenomena that sometimes attend it did at that Time appear, such as Parhelia, and other colour'd Circles, concentrick with the Sun, and sometimes, as once I saw it, excentrick; as also a white Circle round the Zenith, in equal Altitude with the Sun: But this Time, the Air being thickned with a hazy Vapour, and the Smoke of the Town, I could only see to the Eastward a luminous white Patch, which for about twenty Minutes shone through the thick Air very conspicuously, of about two Degrees diameter, as near as I could estimate it, and about the same Altitude with the Sun; and from it, towards the Sun, there seemed to proceed a long
white Tail, much narrower than the Mock-Sun, but which I took to be a Segment of the white Circle which I once saw entire in London. Had the Air been clear, I doubt not but much more of the Phenomena of the Parhelia might this Time have been observed: and I hope, that from our Neighbourhood some Member of the Society may furnish us with a fuller Relation. But how to explain these Appearances, and account for the Magnitude of these Circles, is what seems still wanting.

III. An Account of two Mock-Suns, and an Arc of a Rainbow inverted, with an Halo, and its brightest Arc, seen on Sunday and Monday, Octob. 22, & 23. 1721. at Lyndon, Comitat' Rutland, communicated by the Rev. Mr. William Whiston, M. A. sometime Professor of the Mathematicks in the University of Cambridge.

About Ten o’Clock in the Morning, on Sunday, Octob. 22. 1721. being at the House of Samuel Barker, Esq; of Lyndon in the County of Rutland, after an Aurora Borealis the Night before (Wind W. S. W.) I saw an Attempt towards two Mock-Suns, as I had done sometimes formerly, of which I immediately inform’d Mr. Barker, though without any great Expectations of what followed. About ½ or ¾ of an Hour after, I went to view the Heavens, and then found the Appearance compleat; and when Mr. Barker and others of the Family were call’d, we all saw it, and all saw
