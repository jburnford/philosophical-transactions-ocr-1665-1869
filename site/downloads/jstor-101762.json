I have heard also (but cannot aver it) of a thin, fine Venice-glass, cracked with the strong and lasting sound of a Trompet or Cornet (near it) sounding an Unison or a Consonant note to that of the Tone or Ting of the Glass. And I do not judge the thing very unlikely, though I have not had the opportunity of making the Trial.\n\nAn Improvement of the Bononian Stone shining in the dark.\n\nThe Worthy Signor Malpighi in a late Letter of his to the Publisher, of the 9th of March, takes notice, that one Signor Zagonius had a way of making out of the Bononian Stone calcined, Statues and Pictures variously shining in the dark. But he adds (to our sorrow) that that person lately died, without discovering to any body his method of preparing the said Stone.\n\nAn Extract of a Letter written from Aberdeen Febr. 17. 1677, concerning a Man of a strange imitating nature, as also of several human calculus's of an unusual bigness.\n\nSir,\n\nI am very sensible of the great civility, wherewith you were pleased to entertain Master Scougall and me, when we waited on you last Summer; and shall be ready on all occasions to give you that account you then desired of things philosophical that may occur here, to promote that noble design you have in hand. I remember, we had then occasion to speak of a Man in this Country very remarkable for somewhat peculiar in his temper, that inclines him to imitate unawares all the gestures and motions of those with whom he converseth. We then had never seen him ourselves. Since our return we were together at Scrach-bogie where he dwells, and notwithstanding all we had heard of him before, were somewhat surprized with the oddness of this Dotrel-quality. This Donald Monro (for that is his name,) being a little old and very plain man, of a thin slender body, hath been subject to this infirmity, as he told us, from his very infancy. He is very loath to have it observed, and therefore casts down his eyes when he walks in the streets, and turns them aside when he is in company. We had made several trials before he perceived our design; and afterward had much ado to make",
