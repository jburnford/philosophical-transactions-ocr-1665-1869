The Monster dyed; and is now in my Custody, after it hath been dried in an Oven, and by the Sun.\n\nSome Observations made in Mines, and at Sea, occasioning a Conjecture about the Origine of Wind: Imparted by the same Mr. C.\n\nOne John Gill, a Man well experienced in Mineral affairs, discoursing with me about the Wind and its Origine; declared to me his thoughts concerning the same, as a result of twenty years Experience and Observations of his own.\n\nFirst, He affirmed, that if in digging deep under ground, the Work-men meet with Water, they never want Air or Wind; but if they miss Water (as sometimes it happens, even at 12 or 16 Fathoms depth) they are destitute of convenient Air, either to breath in, or to make their Candles burn.\n\nNext, When (as usual) there happens to be a great quantity of a Winters standing water, in a deep Mine, they commonly bring, or drive up an Adit for drawing away such water: But as soon as that part of the Level is made, that any of the standing Water begins to run away, the Men must secure themselves, as well as they can, from danger of being dash'd in pieces against the sides of the Adit: For the included Air or Wind in the Standing Water, breaks forth with such a terrible noyse, as that of a Preece of Ordnance, and with that violence, as to carry all before it, loosening the very Rocks, though at some distance in the Work or Adit.\n\nThirdly, he hath observed on several occasions, going to and fro, between London and Plimouth, by Sea, that being in a Calm, that way, which the Sea began to Loom or move, the next day the Wind was sure to blow from that point of the Compass, towards which the Sea did Loom the day before.\n\nAn Account of Hail-Stones of an unusual bigness, Communicated by D. Nath. Fairfax, with his Reflections on them.\n\nThis Account came but very lately to hand, though the thing hapned a while agoe; the Ingenious Author thereof, having but newly entered into a Philosophical Correspondence with the Publisher.\n\nJuly, 17. 1666. About 10 in the Fore-noon, there fell a violent storm\nStorm of Hail about the Coast-Towns of Suffolk, tracing along Seckford-Hall, Wood-bridge, Snape bridge, Aldborough, &c. more to the North-ward. The Hail was small near Yarmouth; but at Seckford-Hall, one Hail-stone was found by measure to be 9. Inches about. One of this Town (viz. Wood bridge) found one at Melton, 8. Inches about. At Snape-bridge a man affirm'd, that he lighted on one about 12. Inches about. A Lady of Friston-Hall, putting one of them into a Ballance, found it weigh 12 s. 6 d. Several persons of good credit in Aldborough affirm'd, some Hailstones to have been full as bigg as Turkeys-Eggs; (an ordinary Hens Egg weighs but about 9 s.) J. Baker of Rumborough, driving a Cart on the Heath by Aldborough, had his head broken by the knocks of them through a stiff Country-felt: In some places his head bled; in others, bunnyes arose: The Horses were so pelted, that they hurried away his Cart beyond all command. They seem'd all white, smooth without, shining within. 'Tis somewhat strange, methinks, that their pillar of Air should keep them aloft, if they were not clapt together in the falling; especially at such a time of the year, when the Air is less thickned and its Spring weaker.\n\nAccount of a great number of Stones, found in one Bladder, by the same.\n\nMr. Goodrick Chirurgeon of Bury St. Edmunds affirm'd to me, that himself Cutting a Lad of the Stone (for which he hath a great name) took out thence, at one time, 96 small Stones, all of them of unlike shape, Size, Corners, Sides; some of which were so be-stow'd as to slide upon others, and had thereby worn their flats to a wonderfull slickness. He assur'd me also, that in the same place, another, when dead, had a Stone taken from him, almost as big as a new-born Childs head, and much of that Shape.\n\nThe Description of a Well, and Earth in Lanchashire, taking Fire by a Candle approached to it.\n\nThis was imparted by that Ingenious and Worthy Gentleman, Thomas Shirley Esq; an Eye-witness of the thing, now to be related in his own words; viz.\n\nAbout the later end of February 1659. returning from a Journey to my house in Wigan, I was entertained with the relation of an odd Spring, situated in one Mr. Hawkley's Ground (if I mi-",
