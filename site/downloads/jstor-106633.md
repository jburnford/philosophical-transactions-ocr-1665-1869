XXI. Observation of the late Transit of Mercury over the Sun, observed by Edward Pigott, Esq. at Louvain in the Netherlands; communicated by him in a Letter to Nevil Maskelyne, D. D. F. R. S. and Astronomer Royal.

SIR,

WE have been fortunate here in seeing Mercury's egress. I observed it thus:

Apparent time, May 3.
H. M. S.

20 45 25 Mercury's limb in contact with the sun's limb; uncertain.

20 45 37 ditto ditto; certain.

20 47 17 Mercury bisected by the sun's limb.

20 49 22 Mercury quite out; clouds for a short interval, which renders the observation rather doubtful.

Though the air was not perfectly free from thin clouds, nevertheless the limbs were well defined. At 20 h. 45' 25", when I first judged Mercury's limb in contact with the sun's, his form, I think, became rather oval. These observations were made with Ramsden's two-feet achromatic, magnifying about 70 times. The above times disagreeing so considerably with the tables will, I imagine, not a little surprise M. de La Lande.

I remain, Sir, with great regard, &c.

EDW. PIGOTT.
