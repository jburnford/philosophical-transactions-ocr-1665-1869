  "text": "I. Observations on the Planting and Culture of Tobacco in Zeylan, by Mr Strachan.\n\nThere are two sorts of Tobacco, which both they call Dunkol; the signification is a Smoaking Leaf, for Dun is Smoak, kol a Leaf, the one they call Hingle Dunkol or Singele Dunkol; for they make no distinction of H and S; the other is called Dunkol Kapada, which word Kapada signifies gelding, and is derived from the Portuguese; which Tobacco is very intoxicating, and much stronger than the former, it is the same Plant, the difference is only that Singelese Tobacco has little attendance, upon the other a great deal of pains is taken until it be fit for use, and it is done after the following manner.\n\nThey clear a little piece of Ground, in which they sow the Seed of Tobacco, as the Gardiners here sow Parsly and Coleworts; against the time that this is ready for transplanting, they choose a piece of Ground, which they Hedge about; when the Buffelo's begins to chew the Cud, they are put within this Hedge Ground, and let stand until they have done, and this they continue day and night, until the Ground be sufficiently dunded, then the Ground is tilled with a Spade, in form of a Pick-axe, such as Carpenters use when they smooth Planks, by hoeing the Ground, and turning the same, and mixing the Dung among the Earth; when they have made the Ground smooth, they remove the Plants out of the Bed wherein they were sown, and set them in this Ground, about a foot distance one from another, and then they grow up almost like a Dock;\nDock; when the stem has got 15 Leaves, they cut off all the tops of the Plants; if they desire not to have the Tobacco to be very strong, they let it grow until it have 18 or 20, if they will have it stronger, they top it when it has got 10 or 12 Leaves, not counting the 3 or 4 lowest Leaves, which are nearest the Ground, because they never grow so big and good as those above them. Thus the moisture of the Ground being hindered to waste in more Leaves, Flowers and Seed, all the said moisture enters into the Leaves remaining, so that these Leaves will be 4 or 5 times larger, fuller of fatness, strength and vertue, than the Tobacco which is not ordered after this manner. Now the moisture ascending from the Root, being constrained within the bounds of these Leaves, forces his way betwixt the Stem and Leaves remaining, and sends forth young Sprouts, and would grow forth in Branches, if no care were taken to hinder. Therefore every 3 or 4 days they go through all the Stems, and break off these Buds whenever they spring forth, and this they continue until these Leaves be ripe (which takes as much time as the Single Tobacco does, which gets Flowers and ripe Seed, and then begins to wither and spoil if, no use be made of it,) which is known by the thickness and firmness.\n\nThen before the Leaf begins to wither and is green, they cut down the Stem together with the Leaves, and do bring them into their Houses, and lay them in a heap; and thus the Leaves will begin to ferment, turn hot and sweat, then when the Leaves begins to sweat, they turn the innermost outmost, that they may easily ferment, otherwise the innermost would ferment too much, spoil and rot; thus the longer they lyce in a heap together, the Tobacco turns the more dark of colour. When they think it has sweat enough, they hang it asun or upon Cords, until the Leaves be dry, then they separate the Leaves from the Stalks, and\nand lay them up in bundies together until they have use for them.\n\nNow the other Tobacco, called Singele Dunkol, is only Sown and then Planted, and has liberty to grow, to shoot out Flower and Seed, thus all ripen together, then it is cut down and cast together in a heap; some will ferment too much and rot, others will ferment not at all, and will remain green, altho' it be dry, and will have a smell of Hay or dry Grass. The Souldiers, who delight to Smoak a big Pipe full, and that frequently in one day do Smoak this common sort, some will mix some of the Kapada among it; the Cingualafes, who smoak not so much at once, neither so frequently, do take a piece of the Kapada and roll it together, then roll a piece of dry Leaf of the Wattukan Trees about this, and kindle it at one end and suck at the other until it be consumed. Some do chew it among Betle, taking but very little at once.",
