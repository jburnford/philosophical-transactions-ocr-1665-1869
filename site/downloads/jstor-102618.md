it will weigh just as much as a Portée of 110 Aunes of Lyons, which is the general Rule for Calculating, when they draw the Silk out: By this means one may learn to adjust the weight. There are Silks of Piedmont which are very light and clean, and to be preferred before any, in Sale; The Portée of Silk of the lightest, weighs near twenty four Penny-weight to twenty five and twenty six Penny-weights the Portée; others twenty seven and twenty eight, which Weight may be dispensed with, on condition the other Qualities be as good, to wit, well wrought, Even, Fine, and Clean: But above these Weights they cannot be, unless they abate of their Profit, proportionable to what they want in lightness.

VI. Part of a Letter from Mr. Llwid to Dr. Tancred Robinson, F. R. S. concerning a Figured Stone found in Wales; with a Note on it, by Hans Sloane, M.D.

I Here send you the Representation of a Limestone-Marble, we have lately Discovered in this Country, when Polish'd. We have Plenty of it; but few pieces exceed Six, Nine, or Twelve Inches Diameter; for 'tis only a sort of Alcyonium, incorporated in several small blocks of the Lime-stone; whereof the first Figure represents a piece polish'd Perpendicularly, and the other Horizontally. I would intreat you to Discourse some Stone-Cutter, and to advise me what Uses it might seem proper for, &c. 'Tis (to me) more Beautiful than the Florentine Marble, but much more hard and substantial. I should be glad of a Line or two about it.
