Beal Rector of Yeovil in Somersetshire and one of His Majesties Chaplains.\n\nSir,\n\nWith much regard to the worthy Author of Vinetum Britannicum for his obligingness towards the publick, and for the further encouragement and improvement of our Countrey in Hortulans, I am willing to add some Lines to the mention you made of it. And this Treatise may do much good, for the greatest and richest part of England, in all our Champion Countries, and in the very Heart of England, where, through want of the aids here shew'd, they could do little or nothing for Pomona: And where an Apple cannot grow, Shrubs may prosper and bear great store of delicate and rich Wine, by the help of Sugar; which, when brought into common practice, may in a short time prove a great benefit to our Sugar-plantations. And 'tis a point of exceeding good Husbandry, when very shallow Lands may with small charges and little trouble be improved to bear more delicate and more wholesome Wines, than a French Vineyard; and also find good Employment for poor Widows and Children. And hence I beg leave to joyn it together; That Mr. J. B. in the later part of Epitome of Husbandry p. 26, 28. in his usual plainness, teaches an easy and frugal way to raise profitable Gardens of Esculent Plants on the barren Heaths; and this our learned Author demonstrates, how to raise rich Vinous liquors in any shallow Land, that will bear thorns or bryars: For, in such Lands most of our vinous Shrubs will prosper. And then any Gentleman by his own good example may lead on the multitude to drive away laziness, and poverty, and to enrich themselves, by turning our waste Grounds, Heaths, barren Lands and Downs (which contain a great part of England) into Gardens, and Modern Vineyards. And 'tis more honour to raise a Village or Township with competent relief, on Land that hath been hitherto deserted as hopeless, than to make depopulations on good Land, as some have done to their own damage.\n\n1. The ingenio's for Cider-mills, by the Author described, are made by John De la more, a Joyner in Petersfield in Hampshire, from 20. to 30. Sh. price a piece, according as they are single or double. Note, that the former Cider-mills, whether with stone-cases, or timber-cases, are in many places, at five-fold, in some at ten-fold,\nin some at twenty-fold above that price, and very scarce to be got-\nten. And ch 5. Sect. 2. p. 86. he saith; By this Ingenio have been\nground very fine, sometimes 4, sometimes 5 bushels of Apples in an\nhour; and with no harder labour than that two ordinary Labourers may\n(the one feeding, and the other grinding) hold it, by interchanging all\nthe day. And of the larger Ingenio, which he there also describeth,\nhe saith p. 87. By this Ingenio may two workmen, and one feeder,\ngrind 20 bushels of Apples in an hour. And p. 81. he saith; This is a\nremedy against the inconveniences, troubles and expenses in the seve-\nral wares hitherto used: Among which inconveniences, he there na-\nmeth an unpleasant taste of Cider, acquired from the rinds, stems and\nkernels of the fruits, which in the former Mills were much bruised.\nThus the Author, and this is remarkable for them that would have\nthe best and purest Cider. The Cider-mill, or Cider-pres invented\nby Mr. Hook, is described by worthy Mr. Evelyn in his second\nEdition of Pomona p. 66, 67. I guess, that the Cider-mill, so highly\nrecommended by Mr. Carew Reynel in the True English Interest, ch.\n30. and by him there attributed to the invention of Mr. John Wor-\nlidge of Petersfield, and said to make ten hogsheads a day, is the same\nwith those here named by our Author. And, if in these any thing be\nyet wanting, doubtless it will be soon brought to perfection, being\nin such skilful hands.\n\n2. The Author saith p. 186; that Mr. Rickets, Gardiner at Hog-\ndon, and Mr. R. Ball of Brainford, can furnish any planter with all\nor most of all the choicest or most excellent of all the Fruit-trees\nmentioned in his precedent Corollary. And in that Corollary he men-\ntions the best Fruits for liquors that I can yet hear of in England,\nat common sale. For Walnuts and Filberts, his choice is judicious:\nFor I have observed a very great difference in the kinds; to which\nif he had been pleased to add (but indeed they were quite out of\nhis road and method) the best Chestnuts, and the other excellent\nvegetables for diet and food, mentioned in the French Gardiner, he\nhad made an advance (as well for food, as he did for liquids,) to a\npart of the importance of the Introduction to your Vol. 10, p. 256;\nand of the Breviat on Sir Hugh Plat. ibid. n. 113, p. 304. and else-\nwhere by you fervently solicited, in both respects, for restorative\nfood and for refreshing liquors of the best kinds, & by modern im-\nprovements. This I suggest afresh (out of due place) because much of\nthis Garden-food is yet wanting in many places for Noble Tables.\n\nCherries,\nCherries, which do hurt eaten raw, and when the body is heated, may do much good, if made wine, or dried. I once sent you a Receipt, which I received from Mr. Newburgh F.R.S. (who is curiously skilful in extracting rich liquors, and justly famous for his healing extract from Elderberries,) how to make the best wine of Cherries, and to make Plum-wine; which latter, in his way, hath an austerity, that must be allay'd, when 'tis in the glass, with a little Sugar; and not till drawn. 'Tis but from a wild black Plum, much bigger than a damson, round and full of juice, of no harsh or unpleasant austerity; and (doublefs) they will yield a good Spirit for Brandy. And some kinds of those black and russet-tawny Plums may be dried in a kind of Solar stove, made in a Summer-wall for Prunes, if your Winter do not overtake you; or, if that season faileth, they may be dried in a Culinary oven. These Trees bear abundantly, and from a small parcel of ground, of no great depth. And Cherries and Plums make haste to regratify the Planter. I have tasted a most delicious Bonello (or winy liquor extracted by infusions, and compounded with sugar) for the Summer heat, made of the red Garden-currants, by curious Ligons instructions. And a Noble Person, famous for a curious palate, did in my hearing extol a wine made of Goose-berries, beyond imagination. And I have often drank a Raspberry-wine, much different, and far more excellent than any of the mixtures, with Syrup of Raspberries, or any of the ordinary infusions. By these, and other instances, which I now forbear, I am perswaded, that many Secrets for the best way of obtaining rich Vinous liquors are not yet published, and the Author is truly worthy, to whom they should be communicated. And his merits will engage him for many more Impressions. In all this I do not mean to detract from the Author's way of making Currant-wine, Raspberry-wine, or any other of his directions, but only to invite him in all to inquire the Methods which succeed best. And I am not without hope of prevailing with my worthy and friendly Neighbour Mr. Newburgh, to send you some of his Experiments in this kind, that the worthy Author may compare them for his next Impression. Sir Ken. Digby's Post-hume hath great varietie of Metheglin; but he takes not a sufficient compass for other vinous liquors.\n\n3. Our Author saith Ch.5. sect.9. p.134; Green and crude herbs do dull and flatten the spirits of liquors into which they are infused.\nThis I have proved often, on many kinds of Vegetables, that the Plant fully ripe, and full of seeds, which are much stronger than the green leaf, will taste, if of any bitter or odious kind, less odious and less bitter, than the young leaf, and green spray, in any infusion; and will also preserve the liquor longer, and make it more quick, brisk and lively. Centory feeding, and boiled thoroughly, is more tolerable, than the green leaf or blossom, though but slightly and less than half boiled. I know a family, which made great gain by infusing Wormwood full of ripe seed, dried, and of a year old: Thus they made some vessels very strong; and from thence temper'd it in Ale or Beer, more acceptable to every palate: And I have heard very learned and experienced Physicians say, that this drink did generally heal the Dropsical, Scorbutical, and such whose diseases were caused by the coldness of the Liver, or want of digestion. The right and best Roman Wormwood gives an Aromatick flavour, very pleasing to some when young and green; more pleasing to others, when fully ripe and kindly dried. And the tops of red Sage in blossom, with the top-leaves kindly dried in the shade, and with maturity of time, did excel the famous Thea, the Chinois themselves being Judges; as you have recorded it Vol. I. n.14. p. 250; and again in the aforesaid Introduction Vol. io. p. 256. Our Betony is very friendly for the Head and Brain, but not, in this respect, to be compared with red Sage. Add, that Fumitory in the blossom, well dried, is tolerable. Tansey, Mugwort and Southernwood, are less odious when ripe and dried. Rinds of Oranges and Lemons, Citrons, and the like, dried; Roots of Enula Campana, Horseradishes, Burro, Potatoes, and the like, being cut into bits or slices, and a little withered, so moderately, that their Juices be not too much wasted, are thus kindest for Infusions and Decoctions. And the tops of Lavender, when full of seeds, and dried, are used in Beer in Germany; and (as Mr. Hartlib told me) the Lilly of the Valley (which propagates itself by the weight of its feeding tops, descending into the earth,) is much esteem'd on the Elbe, where they have excellent Beer; and in Wine, in other parts of Germany, as a specific remedy against Apoplextical dangers. He said, that in some places of England bushels of it may be mowed. I have not Mr. Ray now at hand to enquire it of him. For drinks in Spring and Summer, the first appearing Leaves\nLeaves and Blossoms of more gustful Plants, by a short infusion, will suffice to good effect. Baume, the best delight for a Cordial: Burnet, most pleasing in French Wine, in delicate Frontiniac, and in green Cider, (as green as the Rhinish glasses were heretofore tinged) made of a green fillet, as they called it, where they had other kinds of fillets. This which I commend (and tried it often) was a small, round, and green Apple full of black spots, of a pleasant odour and taste, and yielded a grateful Stomach-wine, for the extreme heat of the following Summer, well agreeing with Burnet. The Thymes, denominated from Mastic, Lemon, Musk, Yellow and White Thyme, do make a sprightful and speedy infusion in Angelico, against Contagions or Infections. The Holy Thistle, an expeller of bad blasts. Clary, a strengthner of Nature. Sanicle, Comfrey, and the Confounders, healers and knitters of inward ruptures. Burrage, Buglossa, and Cichory, purifiers of the blood, calming and appeasing of spirits; and the Cowslips of Jerusalem, peculiar to mitigate Hoctical fevers: Ale-soft or Costmary (as sweet as Myrtle) and Alehoof, or Ground Ivy, famous for dispatching the maturation of Ale and Beer, and as prompt in healing bruised wounds. The Primroses and Cowslips do now prove, what a spirit Blossoms do give: And of Blossoms the Clove-gillyflower is our chief.\n\nAcute and Learned Writers do maintain it, that a good choice of Diet, duly order'd, is the surest remedy against many of the most obstinate maladies, and the best preservative of firm health: And Liquids have a potent insinuation, by their nearer affinity to our Blood, Humors and Spirits; without straining Nature to the difficulty of Triture, or Colliquation of grosser food: Which the stoutly Carnivorous can best perform, to support their athletic strength. And Flora freely offers to the Intelligent all her copious Wardrobes at hand, with infinite variety for all palates, humors, and occasions. And those who are afraid of breeding the Stone, and other tormenting and mortiferous diseases, may calculate, how much more cheap, easy, and pleasant it is, to drink moderately and seasonably from a hogshead of the best Cider of their own, than to pay large fees for uncertain Medicines at an after-game; or to live alwaies at the rate of hautgouts. The same for the cleansing, sanative and restorative Diet of other Vegetables.\n4. The Author gives good directions for the making or ordering of *Thea*, ch.5. Sect.9. p.140, (which may instruct us for other like foliats,) and for making good *Chocolate*, ib. p.139; which by art and mixtures may in time excel the famous *Thea*, being both Drink and Meat, when duly incrassated; healing, reviving, cherishing, and strengthening Nature. But racy *Canary*, and right *Redstrake* do disdain all mixtures: And in *Barbados*, they say as much for *Madera*. It were to be wished, that the Author ch.5. Sect.9. p.140. had shewed the best way of making *Sherbet* (as he has done Chocolate and *Thea*; for *Sherbet* is an excellent beverage, in high esteem, and very proper for hot Countries; and especially for our Sugar-plantations; where they have Lemons, Limes, and all other materials and requisites: And also, where they have need to be minded, and supplied with more sober allayers of thirst, than their Flagrant *kill devil*.\n\nThus far I have adventured, too boldly, but with sincere respects to the obliging Author, and to the business, with a touch on the by. I am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour, &c.\n\nEclipsis",
