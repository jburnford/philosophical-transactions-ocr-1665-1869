By Captain Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery, Secretary to the Royal Society.\n\nRead March 25th, 1830.\n\nThe invariable pendulum No. 12, with which these experiments were made, was vibrated in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in July 1828; in the Royal Observatory at Altona in September and October of the same year; and again at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in August 1829. The mean of the results obtained at Greenwich, in July 1828 and in August 1829, give the rate of this pendulum at Greenwich, to be compared with its rate obtained at Altona.\n\nThe experiments in July 1828 have been already printed in the Phil. Trans. for 1829, Part I. pp. 100-102; the result was as follows:\n\n| Therm. | Barom. | Vibrations in Vacuo at 61°.5 |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------------|\n| 61.50  | 29.446 | 85970.00                    |\n\nIn the experiments in August 1829 (Table A), the same barometer, thermometer, planes, and fixed support were used as in the preceding experiments. The rate of Graham's clock employed in observing coincidences was supplied by Mr. Thomas Glanville Taylor by daily comparison with the Greenwich transit clock. The following is an abstract of the results in Table A.\nGreenwich, August 1829; Experiments with Pendulum 12.\n\n| Therm. | Barom. | Vibrations | Corrected to 63.53 |\n|--------|--------|------------|--------------------|\n| Aug. 8 | 63.87  | 30.102     | 85959.22           |\n|        | 65.53  | 30.072     | 85958.41           |\n| 9      | 62.50  | 29.988     | 85959.76           |\n| 9      | 64.45  | 29.951     | 85959.24           |\n| 9      | 64.95  | 29.908     | 85959.04           |\n| 10     | 62.90  | 29.806     | 85959.63           |\n| 10     | 63.55  | 29.829     | 85959.29           |\n| 11     | 61.50  | 30.020     | 85960.27           |\n| 11     | 62.50  | 30.047     | 85959.79           |\n\n63.53 29.970 63.0 85959.404\n\n- .090 redn. to 32°.

Schumacher's house, appropriated to pendulum experiments. The door of this apartment is double, and the windows are double sashed, for the purpose of preserving an uniform temperature: a strong mahogany plank is fixed securely to the wall. The agate planes were screwed on it, and the telescope for observing coincidences was stationed in an aperture made for the purpose in the wall opposite to the pendulum, so that the coincidences were observed without entering the room. The clock for observing coincidences, with which M. Schumacher was so kind as to supply me, was Breguet, No. 3405, the admirable going of which during five centuries has recently been published. The\nrate of this clock during the experiments was furnished by Lieut. Nehus of the Royal Danish Engineers, assistant to M. Schumacher in the Trigonometrical Survey of Denmark; who for that purpose compared it daily with the transit clock of the Altona Observatory at those hours which were not suitable for giving its rate whilst the pendulum was in vibration. The heights of the barometer were furnished by M. Peterson, assistant in the Observatory, from M. Schumacher's standard barometer. The height of the pendulum above the level of the sea in M. Schumacher's house was 15.1 toises.\n\nHaving an opportunity on this occasion of comparing the thermometer graduated in 1823 by Mr. Daniell and myself, and employed in the present experiments, as well as in all the former determinations which I have made with invariable pendulums, with a standard thermometer presented by M. Bessel to M. Schumacher, I was anxious to avail myself of it; and M. Schumacher with great kindness undertook himself to make the comparison. The thermometers were compared by immersing the bulbs to the same level in water warmed very gradually in a chronometer stove by means of a small night lamp, and suffered again to cool; the thermometers being compared both in the ascending and descending temperatures. I copy the following particulars of the comparison from M. Schumacher's memorandum.\n\n\"B. . . . are the readings of M. Bessel's thermometer.\nE. B. . . are the equations of M. Bessel's thermometer.\nR. T. . . are the real temperatures.\nS. . . . are the readings of M. Sabine's thermometer.\nE. S. . . are the equations of M. Sabine's thermometer.\n\n1828.

It is probable that M. Bessel's thermometer indicates temperatures more often higher than mine, by a few hundredths of a degree, than lower by the same small quantities; hundredths of a degree are, however, quantities to be spoken of with much confidence, and may safely be neglected on the present occasion.\n\nThe experiments with the pendulum at Altona are given in Table B; and the following is an abstract of the results.\nAltona; September and October 1828.

Reducing both these rates to a mean temperature of $60^\\circ$, in the proportion of 0.44 vibration to one degree of Fahrenheit, they become respectively 85979.77 at Greenwich, and 85979.10 at Altona: whence we have an acceleration at Altona of 8.33 vibrations per diem.\n\n**Table A.—Vibrations of Pendulum 12 at Greenwich, August 1829; on the fixed iron support in the Pendulum room.
