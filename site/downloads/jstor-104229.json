  "text": "the Parts, when separated, might be viewed more conveniently; when, to my great Surprize, these imaginary Fibres, as it were, instantly separated from each other, took Life, moved irregularly, not with a progressive, but twisting Motion; and continued so to do for the Space of Nine or Ten Hours, when I threw them away.

I hope these few Discoveries will prove as agreeable to you, as they were to him, who begs Leave to subscribe himself,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour most obedient humble Servant,\n\nTurbervill Needham.\n\nERRATA.\n\nIn N° 468. p. 374. l. 22. for nor ever read but: And ib. l. 23. for even read ever.\n\nN° 470. p. 551. under the Crown, for E.
