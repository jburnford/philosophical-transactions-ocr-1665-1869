Hadley, Esq; F.R.S.\n\nRead Dec. 9, 1742.\n\nThe Diaries that continue throughout the said Five Years, are only those kept at Crane-Court, Southwick, and Coventry. The Kentish Diary for the Year 1731 is wanting, and ends with the Year 1734. I have, in my former Account of the Years 1729 and 1730, given an Account of the Method and Contents of the Two First. Mr. Henry Beighton's, from Griff near Coventry, contains the Height of the Barometer at several times of the Day, in Inches and Decimals, and the Weather. That from Upsal by Mr. Celsius, from Hudicksval by Mr. Broman, and from Abo by Mr. Sporing, go no farther than the Year 1731; for which Year there is also one from Lund by an Author whose Name I do not find; for it appears not to be Mr. Conrad Quensel's, whose end in the Year 1730, from the same Place: It contains Observations on the Barometer twice a Day, in Swedish Measure, which I have reduced to English; the Wind and Thermometer, which is a particular one of his own.\n\nMr. Weidler's Diary from Witemberg continues to the End of the Year 1734. In the Year 1732, he alters his Method of the Barometrical Heights, from Paris to London Measure, and the Days of the Month from the New Style to the Old one, to make them\nthe better correspond with our Observations. He gives a very accurate Account of the Phænomena of several Northern Lights in the Ends of the Years 1731 and 1733, and Beginning of the Year 1734. His Diaries also contain some few Astronomical Observations, and extraordinary Occurrences.\n\nCaptain Christopher Middleton's Journal of his Voyage to Hudson's-Bay is published already in Philosophical Transactions, No. 418. The Naples Diary by Dr. Cyrillus ends in the Year 1732, and also that from New-England by Mr. Dudley.\n\nFor the Year 1734, that from Dr. Pack, at Canterbury, exhibits in one View, by a Table for every Month of the Year, in the First Column, the Quantity of Rain, and the Evaporation: In the Second, Third and Fourth, the greatest and least and middle Heights of the Barometer, Thermometer, and Hygrometer: In the Fifth, the Meteors, by Variety of Marks, which he gives an Explanation of: In the Sixth, the Direction and Strength of the Winds. He gives also a Description of the Instruments he invented, and made use of, for Observation of the Quantity of Rain and Evaporation, and the Hygrometer, with a Draught of each. For the Month of January, there is a particular Table, containing great Variety of Observations for every Day of that Month. The Thermometer is peculiar to himself, as far as I know; and he gives no Rule to reduce it to the Standard. There is a Letter of his, relating to a Chart of the Levels of Kent, which, he thinks, are so contrived as to cause a Circulation of Air from the Sea, which is of great Use. Mr. Forth's Diary, at large, from Darlington, begins in the Year 1737; but he has given an Abstract for the Three pre-\npreceding Years: In which the greatest, least and middle Height of the Barometer is given for every Month; which Mean, upon Examination, I take to be found in the way used in these Tables, and therefore I have put them in as such. By a Letter of his it appears, his Thermometer stands at Forty-five Degrees, when Mr. Hawksby's stands at Thirty-three, which is Twelve Difference; and, I suppose, he means they differ so much throughout the Scale; so by that Rule I have reduced his Observations to the Table. Quare, At what Time of the Day the Observations were made, and where the Thermometer was placed; for the mean Heights differ but little from those at London, as he observes in his Letter. There is an Extract of a Letter from Signor Didacus de Revillas to Dr. Mortimer, containing an Account of the Rain that fell at Rome, beginning with August 1734, and ending with July 1735, in Paris Measure, which I have reduced to English.\n\nMarquis Poleni's Diaries, at large, from Padua, end in the Year 1730; but he sent an Abstract of his Observations for the Six following Years, which was published in the Philosophical Transactions, No 448. in which the Account of the Depth of Rain being intire, I have inserted it in the Table, for the readier comparing it with other Places.\n\nThese are all the Manuscript Observations communicated to the Royal Society, relating to Meteorological Observations. I have added the Observations of the Barometer, Thermometer, and Rain, at Edinburgh, from the Four Volumes of Medical Essays; and Mr. Doppelmaier's Barometrical Observations.\ntions, from the printed ones at Norimberg, to make the Tables as general as I could. The Tables are drawn up in the same manner as those for the Years 1729 and 1730; and from them various Observations and Comparisons may be made, in the same manner as has been done by several Hands heretofore, particularly, Dr. Plot, Dr. Derham, Mr. Locke, Marquis Poleni, and others, as appears in the Transactions of this Society; and many more such Observations may be added, by those that are curious in these things, at their Pleasure.\nA Table of the monthly mean Heights, and also of the greatest Ascents and Descents of the Barometer, observed in several Places, and communicated to the Royal Society, for the Year 1731, in Inches and Decimals.\n\n|                | Crane-Court, London.
