Page 272, line 21, for "sin. l" read "sin. λ."

— 274, line 15, for "sin. l" read "sin. λ."

— 274, line 17, instead of the equation there set down, read as follows:

\[ \text{Sin. } \lambda. \tan. (\Omega - l) = \tan. (\pi - \sigma); \quad (2) \]

In consequence of these corrections, the dates in Col. 5 of the table page 277 and 278, which have been inadvertently computed from the erroneous formula, are for the most part incorrect.

Page 347, line 16, for crest, read crust.
