On the Barometrical Variation as affected by the Moon's Declination.\n\nBy Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nReceived January 16,—Read June 19, 1845.\n\nThese calculations were begun with the year 1815, and continued to 1832: the present paper continues them to 1841. The method used to bring out the averages may be thus described. Beginning as nearly as may be at the winter solstice, the days of a solar year are classed in what may be termed weeks of declination, mostly of seven days each, the middle day of each week corresponding;—1, with the moon's position coming north from the equator; 2, with her position in full north declination; 3, with her position returning to south over the equator; 4, with her full south declination. The average, or mean height of the barometer, in each of these classes, is presumed to express the relative power, or effect, of the position to which it belongs; when divested of the much larger amount of variation due to the effect of a northerly or southerly current, of the variable pressure of the aqueous atmosphere, of the temperature of the season, the deposition of rain, &c. Mixed with these, the weekly averages offer a mass of results sufficiently discordant; but the discrepancy vanishes when those under each class are averaged upon the solar year; the other movements now balancing and neutralising each other.\n\nThe present series of averages extends then from December 20, 1832, where the former ends, to December 23, 1841. It corresponds nearly with the latter or cold half of the cycle of annual temperatures, which I have already laid before the public. And it being probable that a close connexion exists between the pressure and the temperature of the atmosphere of these latitudes, in its variations, my taking these limits may facilitate to students a careful comparison of the two, throughout a cycle.\n\nIn my paper of March 1841, the mean height of the barometer for each of the four positions came out, by averages upon eighteen years ending with 1832, as follows, viz.—\n\nMoon coming north over equator . . . . . . 29°8724 in.\nMoon in north declination . . . . . . . . 29°8608 in.\nMoon going over equator, south . . . . . . 29°8450 in.\nMoon in south declination . . . . . . . . 29°8261 in.\nHence it was inferred that the barometrical mean is *depressed* in these latitudes by the moon's position in south declination; and that which appeared upon the aggregate of years, was found to hold also in the several nine-years' averages of which it consisted. The depression was stated to be gradual, proceeding through the three changes to the south place; but upon the planet's quitting her south position to return north, a sudden elevation of the mean, effected in a single week of declination, indicated the return of the pressure (as far as regarded *this* influence) to its former limit.\n\nThe results of the present examination differ somewhat in the proportions of pressure shown; the chief cause being, as I apprehend, the different latitude in which a part of the observations took place. In 1828, near the middle of the year, having given up my house on Tottenham-green, I removed the barometer-clock to the Villa, Ackworth, Yorkshire, in latitude 53° 39' north, and still on the east side of the island. Here I obtained for some time the yearly circle of the variation: but coming subsequently to spend the winter in the south, from my absence joined with other causes, the clock for several months in the year stood still. I had presented a good barometer to the Friends' Institution at Ackworth, where a good meteorological register is kept at my instance; and from *this* the maxima and minima, wanting in the series by the clock, have been taken.\n\nThus circumstanced, and the instrument standing, from the above date, on considerably higher ground, and 2° more to the north, the averages from 1824 to 1832 come out as follows, viz. moon coming north 29·8505 in.; in north declination 29·8257 in.; going south 29·8076 in.; in south declination 29·8058 in. Here we have still the depression to the place of south declination; but with a check, amounting almost to the doing of it away, in the concluding position. Let us, however, see further.\n\nOn the solar years, from 1833 to 1841, *observed wholly at Ackworth*, the averages are,—\n- Moon coming north . . . . . 29·7127 in.\n- Moon in north declination . . . 29·6946 in.\n- Moon going south . . . . . 29·6969 in.\n- Moon in south declination . . . 29·7115 in.\n\nThe former variation, presenting a gradual decline of gravity to the moon's south place, is here replaced by one altogether different; the loss of gravity by the north declination continues into the following week, and is restored (very nearly) in the fourth week; the moon yet full *south*. Had this discrepancy resulted from less perfect observation merely, it ought to have affected each position alike, and to have made the calculations useless; but we have here even more of *symmetry* than before. There must be something then in the more northern latitude, affecting partially the *mixed* average 1824 to 1832, and more completely the *northern* average 1833 to 1841; which is commended, with all deference, to the study and consideration of our mathematical and astronomical Fellows.\nIn my former paper, I exhibited likewise a set of averages upon the whole solar year, from 1815 to 1832, in which the yearly mean pressure increases to the middle of a cycle of eighteen years, and then decreases with great regularity to its former amount. I have inserted here a similar calculation, but with an opposite result; which shows the pressure decreasing from year to year, and then recovering in some measure its former level: but this, for reasons already given, comes out less regular and symmetrical than the other. I have no doubt that, when we shall have prosecuted further the comparison of the yearly mean pressures with the temperatures, there will be found a contrast between the two halves of a cycle as evident as that I have shown to exist in those of the cycle of temperature.\n\nIn the long average, 1815 to 1841, we have,—1, a half cycle cold; 2, a half cycle warm; 3, a half cycle cold; the result of which must needs show a preponderance of the effect of cold. But let the temperatures balance, as in the cycle 1815–32, we have then—1, coming north 29°3310 in.; 2, north 29°8260 in.; 3, going south 29°8171 in.; 4, south 29°8056 in. Again, in the balanced cycle 1824–41, we have for the four respectively,—1, coming north 29°7816 in.; 2, north 29°7601 in.; 3, going south 29°7522 in.; 4, south 29°7586 in. The results of this last average are subject in some degree to the effect of a more northerly site. Without presuming to determine even that latitude has such an effect in a space of less than three degrees, I have thought it right to place these data in the hands of the Fellows, that future students may have the opportunity (now that we have begun to distinguish between the various causes affecting the gravity of the atmosphere) of comparing (with much trouble saved) the actual differences which obtain in it, under different positions of the planet; and of analysing, with the help of the register whence they are derived, a great mass of observations tending to throw light on the nascent science of meteorology.\n\nI have to acknowledge, in concluding this paper, my obligations to my young friend Cornelius Hanbury, who made for me the preliminary calculations upon the register with much care, and, I am satisfied, with the required accuracy.\n\nL.
