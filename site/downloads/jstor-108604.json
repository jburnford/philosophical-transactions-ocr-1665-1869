On the Figure, Dimensions, and Mean Specific Gravity of the Earth, as derived from the Ordnance Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain and Ireland. Communicated by Lieut.-Colonel James, R.E., F.R.S. &c., Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey.\n\nReceived April 30,—Read May 8, 1856.\n\nThe Trigonometrical Survey of the United Kingdom commenced in the year 1784, under the immediate auspices of the Royal Society; the first base was traced by General Roy, of the Royal Engineers, on the 16th of April of that year, on Hounslow Heath, in presence of Sir Joseph Banks, the then President of the Society, and some of its most distinguished Fellows.\n\nThe principal object which the Government had then in view, was the connexion of the Observatories of Paris and Greenwich by means of a triangulation, for the purpose of determining the difference of longitude between the two observatories.\n\nA detailed account of the operations then carried on is given in the first volume of the 'Trigonometrical Survey,' which is a revised account of that which was first published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1785 and three following years.\n\nAt the time when these operations were in progress, the Survey of several counties in the south-east of England, including Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Hampshire, was also in progress, under the direction of the Master-General of the Ordnance, for the purpose of making military maps of the most important parts of the kingdom in a military point of view; and it was then decided to make the triangulation which extended from Hounslow to Dover the basis of a triangulation for these surveys.\n\nIt is extremely to be regretted that a more enlarged view of the subject had not then been taken, and a proper geometrical projection made for the map of the whole kingdom. As it is, the south-eastern counties were first drawn and published in reference to the meridian of Greenwich, then Devonshire in reference to the meridian of Butterton in that county, and thirdly the northern counties in reference to the meridian of Delamere in Cheshire; but there is a large intermediate space, the maps of which are made of various sizes to accommodate them to the convergence of the meridian.\n\nIn 1799 the Royal Society gave further proof of the interest it took in the progress of the Survey, by lending to the Ordnance its great 3-foot Theodolite, made by Ramsden, for the purpose of expediting the work of the Survey; and I have great pleasure in stating, that although this instrument has been in almost constant use for the last sixty-seven years, during which time it has been placed on the highest\nchurch towers and the loftiest mountains in the kingdom, from the Shetlands to the Scilly Islands, it is at this day in perfect working order, and probably one of the very best instruments that was ever made.\n\nThe great Trigonometrical operations of the Survey have been carried on under so many officers, from the time of their commencement under General Roy down to the present time, that it would be quite impossible, in this short notice, to mention more than the names of several Superintendents who have succeeded General Roy, viz. Colonel Williams, Major-General Mudge, Major-General Colby, and Colonel Hall; but in justice to the highly meritorious body of non-commissioned officers of the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners, I should state, that whilst in the early part of the Survey the most important and delicate observations were entrusted solely to the commissioned officers, these duties have of late years been performed by the non-commissioned officers with the greatest skill and accuracy.\n\nIn the Historical sketch of the Survey which I purpose publishing shortly, I hope to be able to do justice to the individual merits of all employed.\n\nThe computations connected with the corrections of the observed angles, to make the whole triangulation as nearly as possible perfectly consistent, have been most voluminous, and have been made under the direction of Lieut.-Colonel Yolland; Captain Cameron, and Captain Alexander R. Clarke; but I gladly avail myself of this opportunity to acknowledge the great and important assistance and advice which, both as regards the instruments and the calculations, we have at all times received from the Astronomer Royal.\n\nThe triangulation by the methods which will be explained, is now made consistent in every part, so that any side of any triangle being taken as a base, the same distance will be reproduced when it is computed through any portion or the whole series of triangles; and when the five measured bases on which we rely are incorporated in this triangulation, the greatest difference between their measured and computed lengths is not as much as 3 inches, and yet some of the bases are upwards of 400 miles apart.\n\nSeveral bases of from five to seven miles long have been measured, but those upon which the chief reliance has been placed are the Lough Foyle and Salisbury Plain bases, which were measured with General Colby's compensation bars. The difference between the measured and computed length of the one base from the other through the triangulation is $0.4178$ ft., or about 5 inches.\n\nThis difference has been divided in proportion to the square root of the lengths of the measured bases, by which we have obtained the mean base which has been used in the triangulation; there is therefore a difference of $+0.2$ ft., or $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches between the measured and computed length of these bases from the mean base.\n\nThe Hounslow Heath base was measured with Ramsden's 100-ft. steel chains, and only differs $0.173$ ft., or about 2 inches, from its computed length from the mean base.\n\nThe Belhelvie base in Aberdeenshire, also measured with the steel chains, differs only $0.24$ ft., or less than 3 inches, from the computed length.\nThe difference between the measured and computed length of the Misterton Carr base, near Doncaster, also measured with the steel chains, is only 0·191 ft., or about 2 inches; and it will be observed that the difference between the computed and measured lengths of these three bases (measured with chains) is not greater than the difference between the measured and computed length of the Lough Foyle and Salisbury Plain bases (measured with the compensation bars), from which it may be inferred that bases measured with steel chains are deserving of the greatest confidence; and when the great simplicity, portability, and cheapness of the chains is compared with the complex, heavy and expensive apparatus of the compensation bars, I should anticipate that they would be more generally employed than they have been of late years, especially in the colonies, and in countries where the transport of heavy articles is effected with difficulty.\n\nThe length of the base on Rhuddlan Marsh in North Wales, which was measured with steel chains, differs 1·596 ft. from the computed length; but from the circumstance that the extremities of the base are very badly situated with reference to the surrounding Trigonometrical stations, the angles being very acute, and not well observed, we have placed little confidence in the result of the comparison of its computed and measured length.\n\nOne of the first practical results arising from the completion of the triangulation is, that we are now able to engrave the latitude and longitude on the marginal lines of the old sheets of the 1-inch map of England, and this is now being done.\n\nThe following account of the Trigonometrical operations and calculations has been drawn up by Captain Alexander R. Clarke, R.E.: this account may be considered as an abridgement of that more detailed account which is now in the press, and will be shortly published.\n\nIt will be seen that the equatorial diameter of the earth, as derived from the Ordnance Survey, is 7926·610 miles, or about one mile greater than it is given by the Astronomer Royal in his 'Figure of the Earth,' and that the ellipticity is $\\frac{1}{299,35}$, or as the Astronomer Royal conjectured, something \"greater than $\\frac{1}{300}$,\" which he gives in the same paper.\n\nThe mean specific gravity of the earth, as derived from the observations at Arthur's Seat, was stated in a former paper to be 5·14; the calculations have since been revised, and we now find it to be 5·316.\n\nThe mean specific gravity of the earth, as derived from the only other observations on the attraction of mountain masses on which any reliance has been placed, viz. the Schehallien observations, give, as finally corrected by Hutton, $\\frac{9}{20}$, or almost 5·0.\n\nFrom the experiments with balls we have the following results:\n\n- By Cavendish, as corrected by Baily . . . . . 5·448\n- By Baily . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5·67\n- By Reich . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5·44\nFrom the pendulum experiments at a great depth and on the surface, the Astronomer Royal obtained $6.566$.\n\nI have recently received, through the Astronomer Royal, two copies of the new National Standard Yard: it is obviously necessary that our geodetic measures should be given in reference to the standard; but not knowing from what scale the standard has been taken, I am unable to say at present in what way the reduction is to be made; that is, whether by reference to the comparison of the old standards which have been already made, or by the mechanical process of a direct comparison of the Ordnance Standard with the new National Standard.\n\nH. James, Lieut.-Colonel R.E.\n\nThe Principal Triangulation of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain and Ireland, extending from the Scilly Isles, in latitude $49^\\circ 53'$, to the Shetland Isles, in latitude $60^\\circ 50'$, and embracing at its widest extent about $12^\\circ$ of longitude, consists of about 250 stations.\n\nThe observations for the connexion of the trigonometrical stations have been made with four large theodolites, two of 3 feet, one of 2 feet, and the other of 18 inches in diameter. The first two instruments (one of which is the property of the Royal Society), and the 18-inch theodolite, were constructed by Ramsden at the commencement of the trigonometrical operations in England in 1798: the 2-feet theodolite was constructed by Messrs. Troughton and Simms at the commencement of the Irish Survey in 1824.\n\nThe latitudes of thirty-two of the stations of the principal triangulation have been determined by observations made with Ramsden's zenith sector, and since the destruction of that instrument in the great fire at the Tower of London, with Airy's zenith sector. All the observations made with these instruments have been published in detail*.\n\nThe mode of observing with the theodolite may be shortly described as follows:—The instrument being first placed very carefully over the precise centre of the station, an object having a fine vertical line of light, with a breadth of about $10''$, is set up in a convenient position within a mile or two of the station; this object, called the \"referring-object,\" serves as a point of reference from which all angles are measured. The lower limb of the instrument being clamped, the observer intersects the referring-object and then each of the principal points in succession, concluding with a second observation of the referring-object, which should be identical, within the limits of errors of observation, with the first reading of that object: the instrument is then unclamped and the bearings read again on different parts of the divided circle. The method by which these observations are reduced to the most probable\n\n* 'Astronomical Observations made with Ramsden's Zenith Sector,' 1842. 'Astronomical Observations made with Airy's Zenith Sector,' 1852.\nresults, is an approximate solution of the equations resulting from the method of least squares.\n\nThe direction of the meridian has been determined by observations of the elongations of α, δ, λ Urs. min. and 51 Cephei; at six of the stations at which these observations have been made, the probable error of the result is under 0″·40, at twelve under 0″·50, at thirty-four under 0″·70, and at fifty-one under 1″·00.\n\nMeasured Base Lines.\n\nThe account of the measurement with Ramsden’s steel chain of the base lines on Hounslow Heath in 1791, on Salisbury Plain in 1794, on Misterton Carr in 1801, and on Rhuddlan Marsh in 1806, will be found in the ‘Account of the Trigonometrical Survey.’ These base lines are all expressed in terms of Ramsden’s brass scale at the temperature of 62° Fahrenheit. The chains were compared with Ramsden’s prismatic bar (20 feet in length), which was laid off from the brass scale at the temperature of 54° Fahrenheit. By a series of comparisons of the Ordnance 10-foot standard iron bar (designated O₁) with Ramsden’s 20-foot standard, made at Southampton, it was found that\n\n\\[ \\text{Ramsden’s bar} = 20\\cdot0007656 \\text{ feet of } O₁, \\]\n\nso that any measurement expressed in terms of feet of Ramsden’s bar at 62° must be multiplied by 1·0000383 to give feet of O₁, at the same temperature. Also to reduce a measurement expressed in terms of Ramsden’s brass scale to the same in terms of Ramsden’s bar, it must be increased by a quantity corresponding to the difference of the expansions of brass and iron for 8°; and taking these quantities as used in the reduction of the bases, it will be found that the multiplier is 1·0000328, and hence to reduce the old bases to feet of O₁, they must be multiplied by 1·0000711.\n\nIn 1816 a base line of five miles in length was measured by Major-General Colby on Belhelvie Sands, Aberdeenshire: the measurement was effected with Ramsden’s steel chains, and in precisely the same manner as the previous bases. The chains were compared with Ramsden’s bar by Mr. Berge both before and after the measurement.\n\nIn 1826–27 the Lough Foyle Base was measured in the north of Ireland with Major-General Colby’s compensation bars. Of this measurement a description in detail has been published*.\n\nIn 1849 the old base line on Salisbury Plain was remeasured. This measurement exceeded the old measure when reduced to the same standard by a foot. The guns marking the extremities of the old line were found imbedded very firmly in the earth, and in all probability in exactly their original positions.\n\nBy a series of comparisons instituted in 1834† between the Royal Astronomical\n\n---\n\n* ‘Account of the Measurement of the Lough Foyle Base,’ by Captain Yolland, R.E., 1847.\n† The observations which were made by the late Lieut. Murphy, Royal Engineers, are given in the ‘Account of the Measurement of the Lough Foyle Base.’\nSociety's Scale and the Ordnance Standard O₁, it was determined that\n\nOrd. Standard $O_1 = 119\\cdot997508$ mean inches of the centre yard of the Royal Astronomical Society's Scale; also from Mr. Baily's comparison of this scale with the standard metre he determined*\n\nStandard Metre $= 39\\cdot369678$ mean inches of the centre yard of the Royal Astronomical Society's Scale.\n\nFrom more recent observations, it appears that the Royal Astronomical Society's scale has undergone a permanent alteration of length; the interval however between the two series of observations above quoted was not sufficiently long to vitiate the connexion thus established between the Ordnance Standard and the metre. The resulting value of the metre in terms of $O_1$ is therefore\n\n$$\\text{Standard Metre} = 3\\cdot2808746 \\text{ mean feet of } O_1,$$\n\nand hence since the metre $= 443\\cdot296$ lines of the toise of Peru,\n\n$$\\text{Toise} = 6\\cdot3945438 \\text{ mean feet of } O_1.$$\n\nReduction of the Triangulation.\n\nIf $u$ represent the true ratio of the distance between any two points in a network of triangulation to the base line; $A B C...A'...$ the true angles, whose observed values are $A + \\alpha$, $B + \\beta$, $C + \\gamma...A' + \\alpha'$..., then if $u_1$ be the calculated value of $u$ obtained by using the series of observed angles $ABC...$, $u'_1$ the value obtained by using the series of observed angles $A'B'C'...$.\n\n$$u = f(ABC...) = f(A'B'C'...) = ...$$\n\n$$u_1 = u + a\\alpha + b\\beta + c\\gamma + ...$$\n\n$$u'_1 = u + a'\\alpha' + b'\\beta' + c'\\gamma' + ...$$\n\nand so on. Each different calculation of $u$ will therefore give a different value for that quantity.\n\nIn the necessary existence of these discrepancies among the calculated values of $u$, it becomes of much importance to obtain the most probable value. In ordinary calculations this has been generally effected by assuming it to be the mean of all the calculated values $u_1, u'_1, u''_1,...$. This might be improved upon by assigning to each value of $u$ its proper weight by means of the weights of the observed angles, but the method would still be imperfect and discrepancies would still exist in other parts of the work.\n\nFrom the above equations, though we cannot determine the precise value of $u$, yet we can obtain some precise information respecting the errors of observation; for we have evidently, since the quantities $abc...a'b'c'...$ are numerical, certain equations of condition between the unknown errors.\n\nBut the number of such equations of condition for the whole figure being necessarily less than the actual number of errors, an indefinite number of systems of corrections\n\n* Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, vol. ix.\nmight be obtained that would satisfy all the geometrical relations of the triangulation. The question then is to determine that system which is the most probable, and the solution derived from the theory of probabilities is, that the most probable system of corrections $x x' \\ldots$ is that which makes the function $\\Sigma(wx^2)$* a minimum.\n\nIf $n$ be the number of observed angles in a network of triangulation, $m$ the number of points, then $2(m-2)$ will be the number of angles absolutely required to fix all the points, consequently the geometrical figure must supply $n-2m+4$ equations of condition amongst the true angles or amongst the corrections to the observed angles: we have therefore $n-2+4$ equations of the form\n\n$$0 = a_1 + b_1 x + c_1 x' + d_1 x'' + \\ldots,$$\n$$0 = a_2 + b_2 x + c_2 x' + d_2 x'' + \\ldots,$$\n\nwhich are to be determined so that the quantity\n\n$$U = wx^2 + w'x'^2 + w''x''^2 + \\ldots$$\n\nshall be a minimum. Multiplying the equations of condition by unknown quantities $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\ldots$, we obtain by the theory of maxima and minima of functions of many variables,\n\n$$wx = b_1 \\lambda_1 + b_2 \\lambda_2 + b_3 \\lambda_3 + \\ldots,$$\n$$w'x' = c_1 \\lambda_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2 + c_3 \\lambda_3 + \\ldots,$$\n$$w''x'' = d_1 \\lambda_1 + d_2 \\lambda_2 + d_3 \\lambda_3 + \\ldots.$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $xx' \\ldots$ in terms of $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots$ as obtained from these equations, in the equations of condition we get a system of equations from which $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots$ may be determined; and having obtained the numerical values of these quantities, the last set of equations will give the numerical values of the required corrections $xx' \\ldots$\n\nIn order that the results of the triangulation as applied to the determination of the figure of the earth might have the greatest weight possible, the most probable system of corrections has been calculated according to Bessel's method, shortly described above. The principal and only objection to the application of this method of obtaining the most trustworthy results, is the extremely voluminous and tedious nature of the calculations. The total number of equations of condition for the triangulation is 920; if therefore the whole were to be reduced in one mass, it would involve as a small part of the work the solution of an equation of 920 unknown quantities. The following method of approximation therefore was adopted: the triangulation was divided into twenty-one parts or figures, each affording a not unmanageable number of equations of condition; four of these parts, not adjacent, were first adjusted by the method just explained. The corrections determined in these figures were substituted, so far as they entered, in the equations of condition of the adjacent figure, and the sum of the squares of the remaining corrections in that figure made a minimum. Thus each division of the triangulation, with the exception of the four specified above, is dependent upon one or more of the figures to which it is adjacent.\n\n* Where $w$ is the weight of the observation corresponding to the error $x$.\nThe average number of equations in each figure is about 44; the greatest number of equations in any one figure is 77. Each figure was worked by two independent computers. This of itself alone would have been insufficient to secure freedom from error, but the final working of every possible triangle, after the corrections were applied to the observed angles, secured perfect accuracy.\n\nCorrections to all the observed bearings having been obtained in the manner explained, it is clear that since all the geometrical relations of the figure are satisfied, no discrepancies can present themselves between the calculated values of the distance between any two points by whatever series of angles it may be obtained. The triangles are calculated by Legendre's theorem. This theorem may be applied to triangles of any magnitude, up to two or three hundred miles, without fear of error. The greatest errors that can result in the values of the sides $a$, $b$ of a spheroidal triangle as calculated from the side $c$ by spherical trigonometry, using the geometric mean of the principal radii of curvature of the surface for the mean latitude of the triangle as the radius of the sphere, are (the position of the triangle in azimuth being the variable quantity with respect to which the errors are the greatest possible),\n\n$$\\varepsilon_a = \\mu(4l^2 + m^2 + 4n^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\n$$\\varepsilon_b = \\mu(l^2 + 4m^2 + 4n^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\n$$\\mu = \\frac{e^2 \\cos^2 \\lambda \\cdot abc}{12R^2 \\sqrt{1 - n^2}}$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the sphere, $e$ the eccentricity of the earth's surface, $lmn$ the cosines of the angles of the triangle opposite $abc$ respectively, and $\\lambda$ its mean latitude.\n\nComparison of Bases.\n\nThe absolute length of any side, or the linear scale of the triangulation, is made to depend on the bases measured with the compensation bars at Lough Foyle and on Salisbury Plain. The discrepancy between the measured and calculated length of these bases is about 5 inches; this discrepancy is divided so that each of the two bases shall exhibit an error proportional to the square root of its length: the comparison of all the bases is then as follows:\n\n| Date | Bases          | Length in terms of Ramsden's Scale | Length in terms of Ordnance Standard | Length in Triangulation | Difference |\n|------|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| 1791 | Hounslow Heath | 27404-24                         | 27406-190                           | 27406-363               | +0-173     |\n| 1794 | Salisbury Plain | 36574-23                         | 36576-830                           | 36577-656               | +0-826     |\n| 1801 | Misterton Carr  | 26342-19                         | 26344-060                           | 26343-869               | -0-191     |\n| 1806 | Rhuddlan Marsh  | 24514-26                         | 24516-000                           | 24517-596               | +1-596     |\n| 1817 | Belhelvie       | 26515-65                         | 26517-530                           | 26517-770               | +0-240     |\n| 1827 | Lough Foyle     | 41640-887                        | 41641-103                           | 41641-103               | +0-216     |\n| 1849 | Salisbury Plain | 36577-858                        | 36577-656                           |                         | -0-202     |\nLatitudes and Longitudes.\n\nFor short distances the ordinary formulæ are sufficient, but in the case of distances above 80 or 100 miles the following formulæ are used, A being the given point, and B that whose latitude and longitude are required:\n\nLet \\( s = \\) distance AB measured on the surface of the earth\n\n\\( v = \\) normal to minor axis at A\n\n\\( \\theta = \\) angle subtended at the foot of this normal by the curve \\( s \\)\n\n\\( \\alpha = \\) azimuth of B at A\n\n\\( \\alpha' = \\) azimuth of A at B, both measured from the north\n\n\\( \\lambda = \\) latitude of A;
