Æpinus, read to the Royal Academy at Berlin, intitled, *De quibusdam experimentis electricis notabilioribus*. The other is a treatise in quarto, printed at Rostock, intituled, *Disputatio de electricitatibus contrariis*. *Auctore Joanne Carolo Wilke*. Since which time, Dr. Heberden, who is ever desirous of extending the bounds of science, having procured some of these stones from Holland, a great number and variety of experiments with them have been made here, particularly by the ingenious Mr. Wilson; an account of which he has very lately communicated to the Royal Society.\n\nXXXVIII. An Attempt to account for the regular diurnal Variation of the horizontal magnetic Needle; and also for its irregular Variation at the Time of an Aurora Borealis: By John Canton, M.A. and F.R.S.\n\nRead Dec. 13, 1759.\n\nTHE late celebrated Mr. George Graham made a great number of observations on the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle, in the years 1722 and 1723; but declared himself ignorant of the cause of that variation, in No. 383 of the Philosophical Transactions, where many of those observations are to be found. About\nthe year 1750, Mr. Wargentin, secretary of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden, took notice, both of the regular diurnal variation of the needle, and also of its being disturbed at the time of an aurora borealis, as recorded in the 47th volume of the Philosophical Transactions; but is silent as to the cause. I had no opportunity of making observations of this sort myself, till the latter end of the year 1756; but, since that time, I have made near four thousand, with an excellent variation-compass, of about nine inches in diameter. The number of days, on which these observations were taken, is 603; and the diurnal variation on 574 of them was regular; that is, the absolute variation of the needle westward, was increasing from about eight or nine o'clock in the morning, till about one or two in the afternoon, when the needle became stationary for some time; after that, the absolute variation westward was decreasing, and the needle came back again to its former situation, or near it, in the night, or by the next morning. The diurnal variation is irregular, when the needle moves slowly eastward in the latter part of the morning, or westward in the latter part of the afternoon; also when it moves much either way after night, or suddenly both ways within a short time. These irregularities seldom happen more than once or twice in a month, and are always accompanied (so far as I have been able to observe) with an aurora borealis. Thus having explained what I mean by the regular and irregular diurnal variation, and shewn, that this variation is generally regular; I shall now, in the first place, endeavour to account experimentally for the regular variation; then offer a conjecture concerning the\nthe cause of the irregular variation; and, lastly, attempt to make it appear probable, that the aurora borealis arises from the same cause.\n\nThe attractive power of the magnet, (whether natural, or artificial) will decrease while the magnet is heating, and increase while it is cooling; as will appear by the following experiments.\n\nExperiment 1. About E. N. E. from a compass, a little more than three inches in diameter, I placed a small magnet two inches long, half an inch broad, and three-twentieths of an inch thick, parallel to the magnetic meridian; and at such a distance, that the power of the south end of the magnet was but just sufficient to keep the north end of the needle to the N. E. point, or to 45 degrees. The magnet being covered by a brass weight of sixteen ounces, about two ounces of boiling water was poured into it, by which means the magnet was gradually heating for seven or eight minutes; and during that time, the needle moved about three quarters of a degree westward, and became stationary at $44^\\circ \\frac{3}{4}$; in nine minutes more, it came back a quarter of a degree, or to $44^\\circ \\frac{1}{2}$; but was some hours before it gained its former situation, and stood at $45^\\circ$. N. B. The greater the power of the same magnet, the more it will lose in a given degree of heat.\n\nExp. 2. On each side of the compass, and parallel to the magnetic meridian, I placed a strong magnet of the size above-mentioned; so that the south ends of both the magnets acted equally on the north end of the needle, and kept it in the magnetic meridian; but if either of the magnets was removed, the needle was attracted by the other, so as to stand at 45 degrees.\ngrees. The magnets were both covered with brass weights of sixteen ounces each. Into the eastern weight I poured about two ounces of boiling water; and the needle in one minute moved half a degree, and continued moving westward for about seven minutes, when it arrived at $2^\\circ \\frac{3}{4}$. It was then stationary for some time; but, in twenty-four minutes from the beginning, it came back to $2^\\circ \\frac{1}{4}$, and in fifty minutes to $2^\\circ \\frac{3}{4}$. I then filled the western weight with boiling water, and in one minute, the needle came back to $1^\\circ \\frac{3}{4}$; in six minutes more, it stood half a degree eastward; and after that, in about forty minutes, it returned to the magnetic north, or its first situation.\n\nIt is evident, that the magnetic parts of the earth in the north on the east side, and the magnetic parts of the earth in the north on the west side of the magnetic meridian, equally attract the north end of the needle. If then the eastern magnetic parts are heated faster by the sun in the morning, than the western, the needle will move westward, and the absolute variation will increase; when the attracting parts of the earth on each side the magnetic meridian have their heat increasing equally, the needle will be stationary, and the absolute variation will then be greatest; but, when the western magnetic parts are either heating faster, or cooling slower than the eastern, the needle will move eastward, or the absolute variation will decrease; and when the eastern and western magnetic parts are cooling equally fast, the needle will again be stationary, and the absolute variation will then be least. This may be still further illustrated, by placing the compass and two magnets, as in the last experi-\nment, behind a screen near the middle of the day in summer; then, if the screen be so moved, that the sun may shine only on the eastern magnet, the needle will sensibly vary in its direction, and move towards the west; and if the eastern magnet be shaded, while the sun shines on the western, the needle will move the contrary way. By this theory, the diurnal variation in the summer ought to exceed that in the winter; and I accordingly find by observation, that the diurnal variation in the months of June and July, is almost double that of December and January.\n\nThe irregular diurnal variation must arise from some other cause than that of heat communicated by the sun; and here I must have recourse to subterranean heat, which is generated without any regularity as to time, and which will, when it happens in the north, affect the attractive power of the magnetic parts of the earth on the north end of the needle. The reverend Dr. Hales has a good observation on this heat, in the Appendix to the second volume of his Statical Essays, which I shall here transcribe. \"That the warmth of the earth, at some depth under-ground, has an influence in promoting a thaw, as well as the change of the weather from a freezing to a thawing state, is manifest from this observation; viz. Nov. 29, 1731, a little snow having fallen in the night, it was, by eleven the next morning, mostly melted away on the surface of the earth, except in several places in Busby-Park, where there were drains dug, and covered with earth, where the snow continued to lie, whether those drains were full of water, or dry; as also where elm-pipes lay under-ground; a plain proof that these drains inter-\ncepted the warmth of the earth from ascending\nfrom greater depths below them; for the snow lay\nwhere the drain had more than four feet depth of\nearth over it. It continued also to lie on thatch,\ntiles, and the tops of walls.\"\n\nThat the air nearest the earth will be most warmed\nby the heat of it, is obvious; and this has frequently\nbeen taken notice of in the morning, before day, by\nmeans of thermometers at different distances from\nthe ground, by the reverend Dr. Miles, at Tooting in\nSurrey; and is mentioned in p. 526, of the 48th vo-\nlume of the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nThe aurora borealis, which happens at the time\nthe needle is disturbed by the heat of the earth, is\nsupposed to be the electricity of the heated air above\nit; and this will appear chiefly in the northern re-\ngions, as the alteration in the heat of the air in those\nparts will be greatest. This hypothesis will not seem\nimprobable, if it be considered, that electricity is now\nknown to be the cause of thunder and lightning; that\nit has been extracted from the air at the time of an\naurora borealis; that the inhabitants of the northern\ncountries observe the aurora to be remarkably strong,\nwhen a sudden thaw happens after severe cold wea-\nther; and that the curious in these matters, are now\nacquainted with a substance, that will, without fric-\ntion, both emit and absorb the electrical fluid, only\nby the increase, or diminution of its heat: for if the\nTourmalin be placed on a plane piece of heated glass,\nor metal, so that each side of it, by being perpendi-\ncular to the surface of the heating body, may be\nequally heated; it will, while heating, have the elec-\ntricity of one of its sides positive, and that of the other\n\nF f f 2 nega-\nnegative; this will likewise be the case when it is taken out of boiling water, and suffered to cool; but the side that was positive while it was heating, will be negative while it is cooling, and the side that was negative, will be positive*.\n\nFor the sake of those who may be desirous of examining the diurnal variations of the needle very minutely, I shall annex a complete year's observations; and shall deduce, from the regular variations during that time, the mean diurnal variation belonging to each month: whence it will appear, that the diurnal variation increases from January to June, and decreases from June to December.\n\nIn the following table, the first column contains the day of the month; and the second, the hour and minute of the day (according to equal time), when each observation was made. The third column contains the absolute variation of the needle westward, or the angle it made with a true meridian line at the respective times; which differs less than two minutes of a degree from that at Greenwich, where the reverend Dr. Bradley was so kind as to give me several opportunities of taking it, in his presence, by the curious apparatus for that purpose, belonging to the royal observatory.
