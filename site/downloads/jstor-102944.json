The Parts thus dispos'd, and the Stop-cock being turn'd, the Condens'd Air proceeds strongly thro' the Swan-neck Pipe, which discharges it into the Horizontal Tube G. Whose Currency so lessens the Pressure of the Atmosphere upon the Cisterns of the respective Barometers as to cause the Mercury to descend 2 inches at least. And 'tis observable, That that Barometer which is 3 foot distant from the Current Air is equally affected, and subsides parallel with the other. Likewise it is to be noted, that as the Current Air is weakened in its force, so doth the Weight of the Atmosphere again Encrease, and the Mercury in the Barometers gradually Ascend.\n\nIII. An Account of some Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, observed by Mr Tho. Brattle, at Cambridge, about four miles from Boston in New-England, whence the Difference of Longitude between Cambridge and London is determin'd, from an Observation made of one of them at London. By J. Hodgson.\n\nOn the 12th of June 1694, in the morning I went to the Colledge at Cambridge, about 4 miles from Boston, and observed, with the Brass Quadrant there, with Telescopick Sights, the Rays of the Sun being transmitted through one of the said Sights, on a clean Paper, pasted on a plain piece of Board, and fastned at right angles at about a foot distance from the said Sight, on which Paper I had drawn a Circle between 2 and 3 Inches Diameter equal to the Suns disk, and within that several Concentrick Circles dividing the Diameter into 24 equal\nequal parts, whereby I could observe to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) a digit, the room in which the Observation was made was darkened with Blankets, and in order to render the Observation the more Exact (Mr Henry Newman assiting me all the while) I took the Altitude of the Sun with the aforesaid Quadrant, as followeth.\n\nObservations made of the Suns Altitude before the Eclipse began, in order to rectifie the Watch.\n\n| By the Watch | Comp.

B\n\nI had the good fortune (by the assistance of some ingenious Friends in Finch-Lane, near the Exchange) to make some few observations of the last, of December the 11th, 1704 (of which I gave an account to this Honourable Society some time since) as follows.\n\nThe Heavens being cloudy most part of the night, it was 35' after 4 in the morning following, before I could\ncould perceive that the Moon was eclipsed, and then as near as I could judge, she had been so about 3 or 4 minutes at most, from whence we may conclude it began at London about 31 or 32 minutes after 4 the same morning.\n\nMr Brattle found, that at 44 minutes after 11 at Night, part of the Moon's Disk look'd somewhat duskish, and that at 52 minutes, the Shadow was well entred, so that from hence, as well as from a Comparison of the Ingress and Egress of the principal Spots, it probably began there about 49 minutes after 11, whence it follows, that Cambridge in New England lies 4° 4' 2½, or 70° 37' to the Westward of the Meridian of London.\n\nI happen'd to see the Moon the same morning at 35 minutes after 5, when she wanted at most but 3 minutes of being totally eclipsed; so that at London she immerg'd at 38 minutes past 5.\n\nMr Brattle saw her immerge exactly at 54 minutes after 12, whence it follows, that the difference of the Meridians found by comparing these observations, is 4 h 43' ½, or 70° 52' agreeing very well with the former; so that by taking a mean between them, the difference of Longitude of the 2 Places is 4 h 43', or 70° 45'.\n\nI saw no more of the Eclipse that morning, and should be very glad to meet with some other observations to confirm these, but their mutual agreement gives great reason to believe that the Deductions are good, and may be rely'd upon.",
