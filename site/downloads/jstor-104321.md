III. A Letter from the Rev'd Mr. S. Kirkshaw to William Sloane, Esq; F. R. S. concerning Two Pigs of Lead, found near Ripley, with this Inscription on them, IMP. CÆS. DOMITIANO AUG. COS. VII.

Ripley near Barrowbridge,
Hon'd S I R,

Dec. 15. 1735.

I Beg your kind Acceptance of the Inclosed: It is a Draught of One of the Two Pieces of Lead, now in the Possession of Sir John Ingilby, Bart. of this Place, which were found, in January last, on Hayshaw-Moore, Two Miles South of Patley-Bridge, a small Market Town in this Neighbourhood, by a Countryman, whose Horse's Foot slipping into a Hole covered with Ling, he dismounted, and, thrusting his Stick into the Hole, perceived something hard, and of the Sound of Metal; and, by digging, found these Two Pieces of Lead, standing upright, and near each other, about Two Foot under-ground. They are of the same Shape and Dimensions, and have the same Inscription. One of them weighs Eleven Stone, the other Eleven Stone and One Pound. The Dimensions I have marked at the End of this Letter; the Draught [Tab. II. Fig. 1.] is as just a one, as any Person I could meet with in the Country, and at this Time of Year, could take. The Inscription is such as is upon the Leads, to a great Exactness, insomuch that every Irregularity of the Letters is noted: Only it may not be amiss to add, that the Letters are raised, and very bold.
bold. There have been Four other Letters on the Side of each of them, whereabouts I have made the Four Dots in the Draught, but they are grown so obscure, that I cannot discover them with any Certainty.—They seem to have been B. N. I. G. . . .

The great Roman Causeway leading from Aldborough, in this Neighbourhood, into Lancashire, passes within a little Way of the Place where the Leads were found. There have been no Lead-Mines, as far as can be known, within some Miles of it: But a Countryman informs me of a large Rock, about half a Mile from it, on the Top of which there is an Impression similar to either of the Leads, only so much larger as to admit of a Pan, wherein they might be melted, if in so early Time they knew the modern Art of smelting by the Air. As yet, I have not had an Opportunity of viewing this Rock; so that this I have only from Hearsay, though I believe it is credible enough.

These, Sir, are all the Particulars it seems proper to trouble you with concerning these Pieces of Lead. I should only shew my Ignorance and Impertinence, if I did not leave it to the learned and curious Members of your Society, to determine the Original and Design of them: Only give me Leave to observe, that Camden mentions Twenty Pieces of Lead of this kind, found in Cheshire, Part of them with this Inscription, IMP. DOMIT. AUG. GER. DE. CEANG. . . . Camden's Britan. Fol. Edit. p. 679.—And moreover, that among the Duke of Parma's Medals, published by Paolo Pedrusi, I do not find any struck in the Seventh Consulate of Domitian, but what have the Addition of Divi Filius, or the like.—That Author
Author too says, that the First Year of Domitian's being Emperor was the Eighth of his Consuliate; neither of which agree with the Inscription on the Leads.

I am,

Honoured SIR,

Your most obliged,

Obedient Servant,

S. Kirshaw.

IV. The Description and Draught of a Machine for reducing Fractures of the Thigh, by Mr. Henry Ettrick, Surgeon.

Having frequently considered the many Inconveniencies, and great Difficulties, attending the common Methods of Reduction, I determined with myself to attempt a Form more mechanical and certain. I immediately fixed on the Axle and Wheel, as the most simple, and yet fully capable of taking in and ingrossing all and every Advantage necessary towards
