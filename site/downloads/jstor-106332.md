XXII. Journal of the Weather at Montreal. By Mr. Barr.
Communicated by Richard Saunders, M.D. F.R.S.

TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE, BART. P.R.S.

SIR,

Read Feb. 26, 1778.

Some days ago I received the inclosed Journal of the weather, kept by Mr. Barr, for a few of the winter months, at Montreal, with a desire to put it into your hands. I understand that the winter was thought particularly mild. The thermometer was Fahrenheit's graduated 50 degrees below zero. I observe that the wind never blew from the north; nor do I know that it ever blew from that quarter while I was in America.

I have the honour to be, &c.

R. SAUNDERS.
## FOR DECEMBER, 1776.
