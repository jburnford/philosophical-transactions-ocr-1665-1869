Lynn, Esq; at Southwick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire; Communicated in a Letter to James Jurin, M.D. F.R.S. and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London.\n\nSIR,\n\nHEARING that some Foreigners enquired for Observations of the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellite, I have sent what I had of that Sort: They are indeed but few these two last Years, on account of my Absence during part of the Time for Observation, and also on account of the small Arc Jupiter has lately made above our Horizon. The Telescope I made use of is the same as formerly, having a thirteen Foot Object-Glass, with an Aperture of two Inches and four Tenths, and an Eye-Glass of two Inches and an half Focus. By apparent Time, at Southwick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire, Longitude West from London, 00 Deg. 30 Min. as follows:\n\nMonth. D. h. ' \"\n1730. The 2d Satellite began to emerge April 29 10 19 20\nIt seemed in a Minute after to be as bright as the 4th Satellite — 20 20\nAnd at full Brightness about — 21 20\nMonth. D. h. 1 11\n\n1730. The 4th Satellite emerged Jan. 25 9 45 nearly\n1730. The 2d began to immerge Nov. 28 13 17 46\nAnd was quite out of Sight at 19 46\n1731. The 2d began to emerge March 29 11 33 8\nAnd seem'd at full Brightness about 36 30\nThe 1st Satellite began April 18 11 45 10\nto emerge —\nAnd was at full Brightness about 46 10\nAgain the 1st began to emerge May 4 10 4 30\nWas at full Brightness about — 5 45\nAnd passed by the 3d Satellite at 11 49 30\n1731. The 1st Satellite began to Jan. 7 12 2 55\nimmerge —\nAnd was quite out of Sight about 4 25\n1732. The 3d Satellite began to Jan. 28 14 16 00\nimmerge —\nWas but equal in Light to the 2d at 19 00\nQuite gone at — 24 00\n1732. The 2d Satellite began April 30 12 23 57\nto emerge —\nThe 1st Satellite began May 6 12 48 44\nto emerge —\n1733. The 3d Satellite quite Febr. 18 13 5 30\ndisappeared —\n1733. Again the 3d Satellite April 2 13 3 30\ndisappear'd —\nBut it began to fail of its Light\nabout 5 or 6 Minutes before.\n1735. The 2d Satellite immerged May 28 10 45 00\nThe 3d began to emerge August 3 9 10 30\nAnd was 4 or 5 Minutes before it came to its full\nBrightness.\n\nCc VIII. A",
