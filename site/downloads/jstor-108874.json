Samuel Haughton, M.D., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nReceived February 8,—Read February 25, 1864.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nIntroduction.\nPart I. On the Joint-Systems of the co. Donegal.\nPart II. On the Joint-Systems of the Mourne and Newry Mountains.\nPart III. On the Joint-Systems of Cornwall.\nPart IV. On the Joint-Systems of the co. Fermanagh.\nPart V. General Conclusions from the foregoing Observations.\nPart VI. Mechanical Theory of Rock Joints, and its comparison with the conclusions drawn in Part V. from observation.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions for 1858, I have given an account of the Joints of the Old Red Sandstone of the co. Waterford, and demonstrated in it the existence of the following Systems of Joints (page 348):\n\nFirst Conjugate System.\n\nA . . 81 observations . . 7° 46' N. of E. (Mag.) . . 32° 26' N. of E. (True.)\nC . . 49 ,, . . 6° 57' W. of N. ,, . . 31° 37' W. of N. ,, .\n\nSecond Conjugate System.\n\nA' . . 135 observations . . 33° 31' N. of E. (Mag.) . . 58° 11' N. of E. (True.)\nC' . . 47 ,, . . 35° 23' W. of N. ,, . . 60° 3' W. of N. ,, .\n\nThird Conjugate System.\n\nA'' . . 14 observations . . 30° 30' S. of E. (Mag.) . . 5° 50' S. of E. (True.)\nC'' . . 12 ,, . . 29° 10' E. of N. ,, . . 4° 30' E. of N. ,, .\n\nFourth Conjugate System.\n\nA''' . . 1 observation . . 10° 0' S. of E. (Mag.)\nC''' . . 6 observations . . 9° 30' E. of N. ,, .\n\nSince the publication of the foregoing account, I have found the system (A, C) in Donegal, Mourne, Cornwall and elsewhere, and have reason to believe it to be the most important of all the joint-systems of Waterford. I shall therefore call it the Primary System of Conjugate Joints, and the systems (A', C') and (A'', C'') I shall call\ncorrelated Secondary Systems of Conjugate Joints, as I believe that they can be shown to be simple mechanical consequences of the Primary System (A, C).\n\nNeglecting for the present the system (A'', C''), the whole of the Joints of Waterford may be represented by the following diagram (fig. 1), to which I shall frequently have occasion to refer.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nIt will be observed that the Primary System (A) divides somewhat unequally the angle between (A') and (A'').\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Angle between A and A'} & \\quad 25^\\circ 45' \\\\\n\\text{Mean} & = 27^\\circ 5' \\\\\n\\text{Angle between A and A''} & \\quad 38^\\circ 16' \\\\\n\\text{Mean} & = 37^\\circ 11'\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nPART I.—ON THE JOINT-SYSTEMS OF THE CO. DONEGAL.\n\nThe following Tables give the bearings of all the joints observed, arranged according to their azimuths, together with the locality, and a statement of the rock in which the joint was observed. In each locality several joints of the same bearing were measured but only one is recorded.\n\n**Table I.—East and West Joints in Donegal.**\n\n| No. | Bearing     | Dip | Locality                  | Rock   |\n|-----|-------------|-----|---------------------------|--------|\n| 1   | 45 N. of E. | ..... | Between Dunglow and Doocharry. | Granite. |\n| 2   | 45 \"        | ..... | Culdaff.                  | Quartzite. |\n| 3   | 35 \"        | ..... | The Mintiaghs.            | \"      |\n| 4   | 35 \"        | ..... | Urrismenagh.              | Granite. |\n| 5   | 30 \"        | 90  | Gweebarra, South.         | \"      |\n| 6   | 30 \"        | ..... | The Mintiaghs.            | Syenite. |\n| 7   | 30 \"        | ..... | Gap of Mamore.            | Quartzite. |\n| 8   | 20 \"        | ..... | Barnesmore.               | Granite. |\n| 9   | 20 \"        | ..... | Barnesbeg.                | \"      |\n| 10  | 15 \"        | 80 N.| Doocharry Bridge.         | \"      |\n### Table I.

Waterford.\n\nOf the whole 64 joints recorded, 44, or 69 per cent., are involved in these five planes; and the number of observations belonging to each is placed beside its designation in the diagram.\n\nIf we combine together the systems $(A, A'')$ and $(C, C'')$, we obtain the following as the most simple combination of joints observable in Donegal.\n\n| No. of observations | Magnetic bearing | True bearing |\n|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| I.

Secondary System $(A')$ | 5 | $32^\\circ 0'$ N. of E. | $58^\\circ 48'$ N. of E. |\n\nThe angle between the Primary System and its Conjugate $(A, C)$ is therefore found to be $93^\\circ 19'$.\n\nAnd the angle between the Primary and Secondary Systems $(A, A')$ is $32^\\circ 24'$.\n\nThe angle between $(A, C)$ and $(A', C')$ in the co. Waterford has been already stated to be $27^\\circ 5'$.\n\n**Part II.—On the Joint-Systems of the Mourne and Newry Mountains.**\n\nThe following Tables contain the observed joint-planes of the Mourne

Table.\n\nFrom an examination of Table VII., it appears that 71 per cent. of the total observations may be included in six systems of joints, each contained within limits of 10°.\n\n1.

It appears evident from the Table that they are all reducible to four systems, two of which have directions closely corresponding with the joint-systems (C) and (C') already found.\n\n* The magnetic variation of the Mourne district was $25^\\circ 40'$ W.\nTABLE IX.—Trap Dykes in Granite between Goragh Wood and Slieve Gullion.\n\nSystem (A\")?\n\n| No. | Bearing       | Dip   |\n|-----|---------------|-------|\n| 15  | 10° S. of E.  | 60° S.| Dolerite. |\n| 17  | 20° \"         | 50° S.| Dolerite. |\n\nSystem C.\n\n| No. | Bearing       | Dip   |\n|-----|---------------|-------|\n| 1   | 10° W. of N.  | — E.  |\n| 5   | 15° \"         | 90    |\n| 7   | 5° \"          | 90    |\n| 9   | 15° \"         | 70 E. |\n| 13  | 15° \"         | 70 E. |\n| 16  | 15° \"         | 45 E. |\n| 18  | 15° \"         | 70 E. |\n| 19  | 20° \"         | 90    |\n| 20  | 15° \"         | 90    |\n| 21  | 15° \"         | 70 E. |\n| 22  | 15° \"         | 65 E. |\n| 23  | 15° \"         | 70 E. |\n| 24  | 10° \"         | 90    |\n| 25  | 10° \"         | 70 E. |\n\nMean ...... 13° 34' W. of N.\n\nSystem A'.\n\n| No. | Bearing       | Dip   |\n|-----|---------------|-------|\n| 10  | 30° E. of N.  | 65° W.|\n| 12  | 55° \"         | 90    |\n\nSystem C'.\n\n| No. | Bearing       | Dip   |\n|-----|---------------|-------|\n| 2   | 45° W. of N.  | —     |\n| 3   | 45° \"         | 70 N. |\n| 4   | 35° \"         | 70 N. |\n| 6   | 45° \"         | 90    |\n| 8   | 50° \"         | 65 S. |\n| 11  | 50° \"         | 75 N. |\n| 14  | 35° \"         | 45 S. |\n\nMean ...... 43° 34' W. of N.\n\nThe trap dykes, with which other and distant parts of the Mourne district are intersected, correspond in general direction with the joint-systems already found, as is shown by the following, among other examples:—\nTrap Dykes of Systems A and A'.\n\n| Bearing | Dip | Rock | Locality |\n|---------|-----|------|----------|\n| 5 N. of E. | 50° S. | Felstone dyke in slate. | Rostrevor. |\n| E.W. | 90° | Greenstone dyke (19 feet wide) in slate. | Rostrevor. |\n| 5 N. of E. | 90° | Greenstone dyke (12 feet wide) in slate. | Killowen. |\n| 10 N. of E. | ...... | Greenstone in slate. | Clogh More. |\n| 15 N. of E. | ...... | Dolerite in slate. | Slieve Bawn. |\n| 5 S. of E. | 85° N. | Felstone porphyry in granite. | Slieve Bingian (little). |\n| 10 S. of E. | 90° | Felstone in slate. | Armer's Hole. |\n| 20 S. of E. | 90° | Elvan in granite. | Slieve Bingian. |\n\nTrap Dykes of System C.\n\n| Bearing | Dip | Rock | Locality |\n|---------|-----|------|----------|\n| N.S. | 90° | Basalt dyke in granite. | Ballymacrein. |\n| 10 W. of N. | 80° W. | Greenstone dyke in slate. | Carlingford Mountain. |\n| 5 W. of N. | 30° W. | Syenite in slate. | Carlingford Pier. |\n\nWe have therefore evidence of the existence of the following systems of Joints and Dykes in the Mourne and Newry Mountains:\n\nI.

De la Beche and other observers have noticed the relation between the directions of the lodes and of the joints in Cornwall.

I was desirous of testing it in the Carn Brea district, and therefore asked permission of the officers of Carn Brea, Dolcoath, and North Roskear Mines to make use of their maps for the purpose; the permission was readily granted, and I have here tabulated the results of my investigation.\n\n### Direction of Main Lodes (Mag.), 1840.\n\n#### System A.\n\n| No. | Bearing | Name of lode | Mine |\n|-----|---------|--------------|------|\n| 1   | \\(15^\\circ\\) N. of E. | Highbarrow. | Carn Brea. |\n| 2   | \\(9^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Druid's. | \" |\n| 3   | \\(5^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Teague's. | \" |\n| 4   | \\(16^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Western part. | Dolcoath. |\n| 5   | \\(5^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Eastern part. | \" |\n| 6   | \\(11^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | South lode. | \" |\n| 7   | \\(16^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Entral, western. | \" |\n| 8   | \\(5^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Entral, eastern. | \" |\n| 9   | \\(10^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Main lode. | North Roskear. |\n| 10  | E.W. | \" \" | \" |\n| 11  | \\(5^\\circ\\) N. of E. | \" \" | \" |\n\nMean ..... \\(8^\\circ 45'\\) N. of E.\n\n### Direction of Cross Courses conjugate to Main Lodes.\n\n#### System C.\n\n| No. | Bearing | Name of lode |\n|-----|---------|--------------|\n| 1   | \\(0^\\circ\\) N.S. | Carn Brea. |\n| 2   | \\(14^\\circ\\) W. of N. | \" |\n| 3   | \\(6^\\circ\\) \" \" \" | Great Cross Course, dividing Dolcoath from Cooks Kitchen. |\n\nMean ..... \\(6^\\circ 40'\\) W. of N.\nDirection of Caunter Lodes (A''?).\n\n| No. | Bearing | Lode       | Mine     |\n|-----|---------|------------|----------|\n| 1   | 16° S. of E. | Barncoose. | Carn Brea. |\n| 2   | 22° \"    | Vigors' Caunter. | \"        |\n| 3   | 39° \"    | Caunter.   | Dolcoath. |\n| 4   | 40° \"    | Caunter.   | N.

If we compare together the primary and secondary joints in each locality, we find the following Table:\n\n**Table XI.—Angle between Primary and Secondary Joints.**\n\n|                        | Waterford | Donegal | Mourne | Cornwall | Fermanagh |\n|------------------------|-----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|\n| Primary (A, C) and First Secondary (A', C') | +27° 5'   | +32° 24' | +31° 46' | ......    | +31° 1'   |\n| Primary (A, C) and Second Secondary (A'', C'') | -37° 11'  | ......   | -30° 56' | -27° 28' | ......     |\n\nThis Table discloses a very interesting and unexpected result, viz. that, in Waterford, Donegal, Mourne, and Fermanagh, the angle between the Primary and First Secondary Joint-Systems ranges between the narrow limits of 27° 5' and 32° 24', and that in Waterford, Mourne, and Cornwall the angle between the Primary and Second Secondary Joint-Systems ranges from 27° 28' to 37° 11'.\n\nI hope to be able to show that this important result of observation is an easy consequence of the mechanical theory of Joints; but before doing so, I shall prove by the following Table, that the theory of Conjugate Joints used in my paper on the co. Waterford applies equally well to the other districts examined by me.\n\n**Table XII.—Angles between Conjugate Joints, measured from East to North.**\n\n| Systems                  | Waterford | Donegal | Mourne | Cornwall | Fermanagh |\n|--------------------------|-----------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|\n| Primary (A, C)           | 89° 11'   | 98° 19' | 88° 51' | 90° 21'  | 94° 18'   |\n| Secondary (A', C')       | 91° 52'   | ......   | 90° 0'  | ......    | 91° 20'   |\n| Secondary (A'', C'')      | 91° 20'   | ......   | ......  | 92° 30'  | ......     |\n\nThe tendency of Conjugate Joints to place themselves at right angles is plainly shown by the foregoing Table.\n\n**Part VI.—Mechanical Theory of Rock Joints.**\n\nRock masses are always arranged in sheets, whose dimensions in two rectangular directions are much greater than in the third direction at right angles to the first two. Hence, when a system of forces acts upon such a mass, its first effect will be to produce a system of fissures at right angles to the plane of the resultant force. When other forces are subsequently applied to the rock mass, already divided into bands by the parallel fissures, their effect upon these rock bands will be different according as they have a large vertical or large horizontal component. In the first case the bands of rock will simply bend and break across along new fissures at right angles to the original fissures. This cause produces the phenomena of conjugate joints, which have been described and accounted for by several writers, and have been fully discussed by myself in the paper, \"On the Physical Structure of the Old Red Sandstone of Waterford,\" so often referred to by me.\nI shall therefore direct my attention at present to the phenomena of Secondary Joints, which have been shown to take place along directions inclined at about 30°, on each side of the primary direction of the original joints. Let \\(xy, x'y'\\) be the directions of two primary parallel joints, and let a force \\(P\\), acting horizontally, tend to produce a fracture in some unknown direction, \\(ab\\), making an angle \\(\\theta\\) with the directions \\(xy, x'y'\\); if the band of rock were capable of bending, this direction would be at right angles to the direction \\(xy\\); but if, from the pressure of superincumbent rock masses, or other cause, it be prevented from bending, it will fracture along the line \\(ab\\), which is the plane of easiest fracture, and whose direction \\(\\theta\\) is thus found.\n\nLet \\(K\\) denote the coefficient of cohesion of the rock, \\(l\\) the length of \\(ab\\), and \\(h\\) the perpendicular distance between \\(xy\\) and \\(x'y'\\), and let \\(\\mu = \\tan \\lambda\\) denote the coefficient of friction of the rock.\n\nThe mechanical condition of equilibrium is evidently as follows:\n\n\\[P \\cos \\theta = Kl + \\mu P \\sin \\theta,\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[P \\cos \\theta = \\frac{Kh}{\\sin \\theta} + \\mu P \\sin \\theta.\\]  \n\n(1)\n\nDifferentiating this equation, regarding \\(P\\) as a minimum and therefore \\(dP = 0\\), we find\n\n\\[-P \\sin \\theta = -\\frac{Kh \\cos \\theta}{\\sin^2 \\theta} + \\mu P \\cos \\theta.\\]  \n\n(2)\n\nEquating the values of \\(P\\) deduced from (1) and (2), we find\n\n\\[\\sin \\theta (\\sin \\theta + \\mu \\cos \\theta) = \\cos \\theta (\\cos \\theta - \\mu \\sin \\theta);\\]\n\nfrom which follows\n\n\\[\\cos 2\\theta = \\mu \\sin 2\\theta\\]  \n\n(3)\n\nor\n\n\\[\\cot 2\\theta = \\tan \\lambda;\\]\n\nand, finally,\n\n\\[2\\theta + \\lambda = 90^\\circ.\\]  \n\n(4)\n\nThe values of \\(\\lambda\\), determined for various kinds of rock, limestone, sandstone, and slate, vary from 30° to 38°, thus giving for \\(\\theta\\) corresponding values from 30° to 26°. These values agree very well with the angles between the systems of Primary and Secondary joints determined by the preceding observations in different localities; and I believe that the mechanical cause I have assigned is the true cause of these joints.\n\nFrom this it follows that a single hypothesis as to the direction of a system of forces is sufficient to account for the existence of three conjugate systems of joints, involving six directions; and it also explains the rudely hexagonal jointing of many rocks, if the coefficient of friction be such as to render the angle \\(\\theta\\) nearly 30°.\n\nMany other consequences flow from the preceding investigations, into which I have not time to enter, but which may be readily found and turned to practical use by the field geologist who prefers one hypothesis to many.",
