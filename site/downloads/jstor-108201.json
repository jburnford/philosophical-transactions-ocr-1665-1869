Reduced by the Rev. George Fisher, M.A. F.R.S.\n\nReceived November 21,—Read November 23, 1837.\n\nIt was the object in the experiments recorded in this paper, to determine the relative magnetic forces soliciting both the dipping, and horizontal needles, by observing the times of their completing a given number of vibrations at the various places visited during a period of three years, on the North American and West India Station, in Her Majesty's Ship Racehorse.\n\nThe dipping instrument used was one of modern construction by Dollond. Each observation for the dip consisted of an equal number of readings of the positions of the needle, with the face of the instrument east and west, before and after the inversion of the poles, and a mean of all the readings taken for the true dip. The instrument had two needles fitted to it, one of which being used solely for the purpose of observing its vibrations, its magnetism was therefore never interfered with, and this needle in this paper is distinguished by the letter B. The other needle was kept for the purpose of determining the dip, and the results obtained with it are given in Table I.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the horizontal forces, besides the needle B, four other needles, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, were used, the first two, four and a half, the others, three inches in length, and of a cylindrical form. When used they were suspended by fibres of raw silk in an apparatus constructed for the purpose. They had fixed centres of suspension, with sliding weights for their horizontal adjustments. The vibrations were confined to the same limits of arc, so as to render the experiments as comparative as possible, and to avoid any correction for circular arc. The state of the thermometer was also registered, though at present it is impossible to assign with any degree of accuracy the correction due to the results arising from the differences of temperatures at which the experiments were made.\n\nThe needles Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 appear, by comparing the experiments made near London previous to the voyage, with similar ones at the same place at the expiration of it, to have lost during the interval some portion of their magnetism; the same circumstance is also observable from the experiments made at Bermuda and other places. To compensate for this change in the intensities of the needles, the experiments contained within the horizontal lines in the Tables in which they are recorded\nhave been reduced to the same epoch, or mean period of observation, by the application of a proportional part of this change; and the corrected or concluded times of completing a given number of vibrations for each needle, together with the corresponding forces, which are inversely as the squares of these times, are given in separate columns. These forces are again reduced, and compared with the horizontal force at Plymouth, which is taken equal to unity.\n\nThe magnetism of the needle B appears to have been subject to some occasional changes during the voyage, but not of sufficient magnitude or regularity as to admit of any correction being made on this account. The mean of all the experiments collectively, that were made at the same place with this needle, is therefore taken as one result, and compared with others obtained in a similar way at the other places.\n\nSome degree of uncertainty is attached to experiments of this nature when made with various needles, the whole of which have only been occasionally used, and the magnetism of these subject to various changes, on account of the difficulty of assigning such values for the final results as the experiments themselves seem best to justify, since the means as deduced from the experiments at each place are on this account somewhat vitiated, being no longer strictly comparative; and moreover the same experiments may by different persons be differently compared with each other, and thereby results somewhat different may be obtained.\n\nIt is necessary to state, therefore, that the horizontal forces at Plymouth, Bermuda, and Port Royal in Jamaica have been determined by the experiments made at Plymouth in March 1834, immediately before leaving England, compared with similar ones made at the two latter places in the months of June and July following, and by applying a small correction for the diminution in the intensities of the respective needles. The experiments at Chagres are compared with the previous and subsequent ones at Jamaica made at short intervals of times; those at Para, Maranham, and Demerara with those made at Bermuda; and lastly those at Antigua with the previous and subsequent ones at Bermuda. The experiments thus grouped and compared together are contained between the horizontal lines in the Tables II., III., IV., and V., together with the comparative horizontal forces between these places; these forces are then compared with the force at Plymouth, and the results given in a separate column.\n\nHaving thus obtained the horizontal forces at each place as compared with Plymouth, these are again reduced to the forces in the direction of the dipping needle by multiplying the horizontal forces by the fraction $\\frac{\\cos.\\text{dip at Plymouth}}{\\cos.\\text{dip at Place}}$. The comparative whole forces being deduced by means of the horizontal needles, and also by direct experiment with needle B when vibrated in the dipping instrument, the final results are given in Table VIII.\n\nG.
