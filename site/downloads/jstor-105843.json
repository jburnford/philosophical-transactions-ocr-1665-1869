We shall be glad, if these observations can be of any service. We have endeavoured to discover to you the degree of dependance to be placed thereon.\n\nWith regard to the clock, we conclude from these equal altitudes (correcting for difference of declination, &c.), that, on the 3d of June, it was before mean time $1'8''$,8. You will easily discover if there is any error. We afterwards regulated by frequent equal altitudes, by a meridian line on the bottom of a window, and by the setting of stars behind some solid buildings.\n\nThe latitude appears, from these double altitudes, to be somewhere between $36^\\circ\\ 3'$, and $36^\\circ\\ 4'$; but from more correct declinations, &c. you will be able to determine it more precisely.\n\nFor the eclipse, we had no micrometer, nor any other method of determining the quantity of it.\nTo the eye, between $\\frac{1}{4}$th or $\\frac{1}{5}$th of the Sun's diameter seemed to be eclipsed. Though the beginning be rather incorrect, the end may be depended on.\n\nWe shall be glad if you can determine, from hence, the latitude and longitude of the place, and to know the result of the discoveries made in our system, by the observations of the late transit, if you will favour us.\n\nI am,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour most obedient,\n\nhumble servant,\n\nGibraltar, July 14,\n1769.\n\nAlexander Jardine.\n\nBy re-computing these observations, I find, that the external contact of Venus happened at $6^h\\ 5\\ 1'\\ 8''$, the internal contact at $7^h\\ 8'\\ 21''$, the beginning of the eclipse of the Sun at $18^h\\ 8'\\ 0''$, and the end at $19^h\\ 20'\\ 33''$, all apparent time; and that the latitude of the place, by the mean of the 4 altitudes of Cor Scorpii, is $36^\\circ\\ 4'\\ 44''$, N. The dip of the horizon of the sea, for an elevation of 160 feet, may be reckoned $12'\\ 5''$.\n\nNevil Maskelyne.\n\nXLVI. Obser-",
