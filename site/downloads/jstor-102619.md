Quæ propter rogamus, quoslibet Botanicae, Medicinæ, Philosophiae, &c. Studiosos Methodum hujusmodi Propositionis invenire.

Rogamus etiam, an esse possit signum aliquod, & quidnam sit illud, quod ex anatomia, ac cadaverum Dissectionibus certo poterit indicare quemlibet ob assumptum Opium interemptum fuisse?

VI. Part of a Letter from Mr. Llwid to Dr. Tancred Robinson, F. R. S. concerning a Figured Stone found in Wales; with a Note on it, by Hans Sloane, M.D.

Here send you the Representation of a Limestone-Marble, we have lately Discovered in this Country, when Polish'd. We have Plenty of it; but few pieces exceed Six, Nine, or Twelve Inches Diameter; for 'tis only a sort of Alcyonium, incorporated in several small blocks of the Lime-stone; whereof the first Figure represents a piece polish'd Perpendicularly, and the other Horizontally. I would intreat you to Discourse some Stone-Cutter, and to advise me what Uses it might seem proper for, &c. 'Tis (to me) more Beautiful than the Florentine Marble, but much more hard and substantial. I should be glad of a Line or two about it.
