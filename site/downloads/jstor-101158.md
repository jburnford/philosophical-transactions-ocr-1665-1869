ing the Heart from the Office of Sanguification, and charging the same upon the Lungs. To which he subjoyns a Quere, viz. Whether a Man born can live any Time without Respiration? Alleding divers noble Examples of Men, that have done so.

Proceeding to the Third Venter, the Head, he endeavours to refute the Cartesian Opinion about the Origin of the Brain; and then, among many other Particulars, animadverts, on those that alledge Instances of humane Bodies, that were distitute of all Brain, which he is unwilling to believe, suspecting, that it is grounded only upon superficial Inspection. Which done, he disputes against both the Cartesian Use of the Conarion, and that assigned by Dr. Wharton; as also against the Office, ascribed by Dr. Willis to the Cerebellum, viz. to serve for the performing of the Involuntary functions and actions of Animals. After which he Discourses largely of the Animal Spirits, attempting to disprove Dr. Glisson's Doctrine about the Matter, whence those Spirits are Generated, and that also of Des-Cartes, esteeming them not to differ Specie from the Vital: Himself in the mean time affirming them to be prepared in the Brain, thirstily out of the salin and a few sulphureous Particles of the Blood, and design'd not only for the animal, but also for some of the natural Actions of the Body, especially the Nutrition of the spermatic Parts, &c.

Passing to the Eye, he gives the anatome of the structure of this Organ, and the consideration of the Uses of every Part thereof. The like he does as to the Ear, and the rest of the Organs of our Senses. Discoursing of the Tongue, he will not acknowledge that Part to be a Muscle, as Spigelius, Bellinus, and others, take it to be. Speaking of the Salival Channels, he takes Notice of the contention risen between Blasius and Steno concerning the priority of their Discovery, &c.

Having dispatch'd these three Books, and in them the Three Venters, he goes on to the remaining seven Books, which he dispatches with more Brevity; treating therein of the Artus, the Muscles, with an Appendix about the Membrans and Fibres, the Arteries, the Veins, the Nerves (not allowing of Dr. Glisson's Doctrine, that the Nerves convey the nutritious Juice,) the Bones, the Cartilages and Ligaments, concerning which we cannot here enlarge.
