from our tables, that $A$ must be 35 years of age; therefore find, by the twenty-third proposition, the value of an annuity of a life for 35 to continue for a limited time of 31 years: let that value be sub-
ducted from the value of an annuity certain, to con-
tinue 31 years; and the remainder will be the value
of the reversion.

by Mr. Cradock, communicated to the Royal
Society by Mr. Henry Baker, F. R. S.

Read June 7. 1744.

THE Head and Body emitted an ex-
tremely lucid and white Flame.
The Tail appeared of a transparent Blue, like the
Flame of Sulphur.

This Phenomenon was seen on Sunday, May 27.
1744. at 11 Minutes after 11 o’Clock at Night: Its
Direction from S. E. to N. W. or thereabouts; its
Height seemingly not half a Mile.

It was seen, as here described, from the Terrace
in Somerset-Gardens, by me,

Zach. Cradock,
Of Somerset-House.
