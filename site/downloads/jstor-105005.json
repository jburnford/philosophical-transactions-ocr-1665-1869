The mother and sister say, that on the day they were buried their monthly evacuations were upon them, but they had not the least sign of them afterwards.\n\nThe above account was attested by the said women before the Intendant on the 16th of May, 1755.\n\nCXII. An Account of some of the more rare English Plants observed in Leicestershire.\n\nTo the Earl of Macclesfield, President of the Royal Society.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI take the liberty, by your lordship's means, of communicating to the Royal Society an account of some of the more rare plants, growing spontaneously in Leicestershire, transmitted to me by its author, Mr. Richard Pultney, an apothecary at Leicester. Mr. Pultney is a person of real merit, well skilled not only in whatever relates to his profession, but also in various parts of Natural History. His botanical knowledge is very extensive, and he is very zealous in promoting it. He has already laid before the public, though his modesty would not permit\npermit him to subscribe his name thereto, a series of very curious and useful observations upon the vegetable poisons growing in England; the knowledge of which cannot be too much or too generally inculcated.\n\nThe plants in the work, now put into your lordship's hands, are disposed according to the sexual system of Dr. Linnæus, a very worthy member of this Society: but our author has not contented himself with a simple arrangement of the plants, the subject of his work; he has gone further, and has given us not only the synonymes of some of the best authors, but as far as his reading and observations have enabled him, their medical and economical uses and their places of growth.\n\nNothing can more tend to the advancement of the natural history of this kingdom, than that persons conversant in the various parts of it, should collect the productions of their own neighbourhood, and transmit accounts thereof to the Royal Society. How much correspondence of this kind has already done, nothing can give a stronger testimony than the Synopsis Stirpium Britannicarum of the late Mr. Ray; as this, joined to his own industry, enabled Mr. Ray to communicate to the public a more perfect account of the plants of this country than any other nation has yet seen.\n\nI shall make no apology for troubling your lordship with this, as I am well apprised how sure every performance is to meet with your lordship's patronage, which tends to promote the ends of the institution of that Society, over which you so very worthily preside.\n\nI have\nI have the honour to be with the greatest deference and regard,\n\nMy Lord,\n\nYour Lordship's most obliged,\n\nLincoln's-Inn-Fields,\nNov. 24, 1756.\n\nand obedient Servant,\n\nW.

This elegant plant is not common in these parts. It is found in the river Soar, near Loughborough; also in a little brook near the seat of the Rev. Granville Wheler, Esquire, at West Leke Nottinghamshire.\n\nThis plant was soon discovered by the botanists, after the revival of learning, but they were at a great loss whither to refer it. Many of them took it for the Polygonum or Sanguinaria fæmina of Dioscorides: at length it fell among the Equisetata or Horsetails; till Ruppius, Dillenius, and Vaillant, finding its parts of fructification very different from the Horsetails, called it by a different name, the former adopting the word Pinastella, and two the latter the old name Limnopusce.\n\nThe flower of this plant is perhaps the most simple in all nature. It has neither Calyx nor Petal, but consists only of one Stamen and one Pistil, followed by a single seed.\n\nDIANDRIA\nmonogynia.\n\nVERONICA Linn. Gen. Plant.

What is sold for it in the shops here in the country, by the common herb-gatherers is the Veronica pratensis minor of Gerard and Parkinson, called Little or Smooth Fluellin or Paul's Betony, which is abundantly more common than the true sort. It is not long since the Veronica was a fashionable remedy for the gout, some taking it in the form of tea, and others the powder of the dried leaves.\n\nVeronica, racemis lateralibus, pedicellis pendulis, foliis linearibus integerrimis.

One of the hills in Charley Forest, near Sheepshead, called Ives Head, is almost covered over with it. It grows in Preswold Lanes, near Loughborough; also in a close the foot-way between Quorn and the turnpike.\n\nFrom the regular manner, in which the leaves of this plant are expanded upon the ground, it has been called by some the Star of the Earth; and much has been said relating to its virtues against the bite of a mad dog.

It is not a common plant in these parts; I have observed it upon Charley Forest, near Beacon Hill; and in the moist closes at Woodhouse, near Buddon Wood.\n\nDr. Haller, in his Iter Helveticum, attributes the extraordinary richness and plenty of the milk, in some parts of Switzerland, chiefly to this and two other plants common on their pastures; these are the narrow-leaved Plantain and the Muttelina of Gesner and Camerarius.

It is found upon the common nettle in some of the back lanes about Leicester.\n\nDodder is really the same plant wherever it is found; though authors have been used to call it by as many different names as there are different plants upon which it is found. It is subject to variation in the colour of the stalks, which at first are yellowish, afterwards purple: the colour of the flower is variable too, and these accidents have been the sources of several species. M. Vaillant, though commonly averse to the multiplication of species, yet enumerates three kinds of Dodder in the Botanicon Parisiense, p. 43. But Linnaeus, Haller, and M. Dalibard agree in referring them all to the *Cuscuta major* of Caspar Bauhine here mentioned, which is really the only species found in Europe. *Cuscuta tingit purpurascente colore*, Amæn. Acad. vol.

The Lithospermum arvense or Bastard Alkanet is much more common but not so frequent as in Lincolnshire, where I have observed it among the corn about Grantham and Sleaford abundantly.\n\n**Hottonia**, Gen.

This is scarce in these parts. In a moist\nmoist place in the outwoods near Loughborough. I observed it also about a little brook by the highway on the London road, between Northampton and Newport, about four miles from Newport.\n\nLysimachia foliis ovatis acutiusculis, pedunculis folio longioribus, caule repente, Sp.

In the boggy valleys in and about Charley Forest, and not sparingly.\n\nThe Lysimachia nemorum Linnæi, or Yellow Pimpernel of the Woods, and the Nummularia, Moneywort, or Herb Twopence, are both more common with us than the foregoing.\n\nThe purple-flowered Moneywort is one of those plants, which is almost peculiar to England and France; hence we wonder that Linnæus has omitted it in his Flora Anglica.\n\nCampanula, Gen. Plant. No. 201.\n\nCampanula foliis strictis: radicalibus lanceolato-ovatibus, panicula patula. Sp. Plant. 163. 4.\n\nCampanula esculentæ facie ramis et floribus patulis Dill. Elth. 68. Tab. 58. The rigid leaved Bell-flowers, with a diffusive panicle and patulous flowers.\n\nThis plant is found pretty plentifully in Buddon Wood near Loughborough, and especially in some of the hedges and lanes adjoining. It flowers in July and August.\nDr. Dillenius found this plant near Worcester, and took it for a Non-descript, though possibly it may be the plant, hinted at by Merret in his Pinax, under the appellation of *Rapuntium flore purpureo*. It has since been found in Sweden, though Linnæus makes no mention of it in any of his works before the Species Plantarum: elsewhere we have no intelligence of it. We have no doubt but ours is the plant described by both these authors; but if I might be allowed the conjecture, I should think it was known to Parkinson, and is the plant, which he describes and figures under the title of *Rapunculus nemorosus*. Theat. Bot. p. 649. 650. He tells us that the plant he describes under that name grows naturally wild in England; and tho' his figure is very awkward, and his description very vague, yet both answer better to our plant than to any other of the Bell-flowers, which grow spontaneously in England. Parkinson took his plant to be the *Rapunculus nemorosus* of Tabernæmontanus and the *Rapunculus campanulatus nervifolius tertius* of Thalius, or the *nemorosus angustifolius magno flore major* of C. Bauhine pin. 93. N°. 11. But M. Vaillant, (Bot. Paris. p. 27) and Dr. Haller (Enum. Stirp. Helv. p. 494.) apply all these names to the Peach-leaved Bell-flower: hence if these two able botanists are right, Parkinson must have been mistaken, as the Peach leaved Campanula, which he describes and figures likewise in the same chapter, is not a native of England.\n\nWhence comes it that professor Linnæus in the Flora Anglicana has referred his trivial name of the plant\nplant in question to the Rapunculus esculentus or Common Rampions of Ray's Syn. p. 277. No. 4. and that he has in the same piece omitted this last plant, although he mentions it in the Species Plantarum, p. 164. as a native of this island?\n\nCampanula caule angulato simplici, floribus sessilibus, capitulo terminali. Vir. cliff. 16. Sp. Pl. 166.\n\nCampanula pratensis flore conglomerato, C.B. pin. 94. Raii Syn. 277. Little Throatwort or Canterbury Bells.\n\nIn mountainous places, especially in a chalky soil. It flowers in July. This plant is very scarce in this county; I have observed it about Grantham, Ancaister, and Sleaford, in Lincolnshire, very plentifully.\n\nCampanula caule basi subramoso stricto, foliis oblongis crenatis, calycibus aggregatis corolla longioribus, capsulis prismaticis, Sp.

The lesser Venus Looking-glass, or coded Corn Violet.\n\nAmong the corn flowering in June and July, This I observed pretty plentifully among the corn for four or five years successively near Loughborough.\n\nDr. Haller takes this to be only a variety of the common Venus Looking-glass of the Gardens, and has put it down as such in the Enum. Stirp. Helv. p. 496. and though Linnæus makes it distinct, he doubts whether it be not originally sprung from the same plant.\nSAMOLUS, Gen. Plant. 205.\nSamolus, Hort. Cliff. 51. Fl. Suec. 165. Sp.

About Grace Dieu Abbey in this county, but sparingly. About North Luffenham in Rutland.\n\nThe intoxicating and poisonous quality of this herb is well known, and too many dreadful instances of its effects are to be found in various authors. See Matthiolus Comment. in Dioscorid. p. 756. Edit. 1598. Gerard em. p. 341. Bodaeus à Stapel in Theophrast. p. 586. Wepfer Hist. Cicut. aquat. cap. 17. Boerhaave Hist. Plant. Lugd. Bat. p. 510. The memorable story of the intoxication of the Danes by the Scots, as it is related by Buchanan Rer. Scot. lib. 7. is quoted by almost all succeeding writers, when mentioning this plant. Later instances of its bad effects may be seen in the Gentleman's Magazine for August and September 1747; also in the Magazine for September 1748. See also the case of two children and\nand their father; the former of which died, and the latter narrowly escaped, by eating the berries of this plant. Hill's British Herbal, p. 329. Dr. Haller quotes several authors both antient and modern to prove its deleterious quality. Enum. Stirp. Helv. p. 507.\n\nAs pernicious, however, as this plant has generally proved, when taken unwarily, there are gentlemen in the medical way, who have dared to administer it internally in one of the most formidable diseases incident to human nature: this is nothing less than the cancer. In the year 1739, there was a thesis published at Hall in Saxony, tending to prove it a specific in the cancer. Since then it has been administered in a case of that kind with the greatest success. This case is related in a very circumstantial manner and with the greatest appearance of candor and ingenuity, in the Bithiotheque Des Sciences et des Beaux Arts, for the first three months of the 1755. One successful case is far from being sufficient to establish the credit of a new medicine; but the result of that case seems to render it worthy of a farther trial: and happy will it be for a miserable part of mankind, if it be hereafter attended with the same success.\n\nRhamnus, Gen.

Dr. Haller refers to several, Enum. Stirp. Helv. p. 436. See also the Philosophical Transactions, N°. 480.\n\nWhen Linnæus was at Tornoa, upon the Lapland expedition, he discovered to the inhabitants, that the great destruction of their horned cattle, in the spring, when they were first turned out,\nand when it was no uncommon thing for an hundred of them to perish, was entirely owing to this plant, which is very common in their pastures. Flor. Lappon. p. 72. The Flora Suecica confirms the same effects upon the horned cattle. p. 84. Dr. Gmelin, who observed it in the marshes almost all over Russia and Siberia, tells us, that the people there universally affirm, that the horses eat it without any subsequent ill consequence; but that it infallibly kills the horned cattle, and that they swell very much before they die; which symptom Linnæus had remarked in those that perished at Tornoa. The inhabitants say likewise, that the root of the plant is abundantly more poisonous than the leaves. See Flora Sibirica, Vol. I. p. 203.\n\nPIMPINELLA, Gen. Plantar.

Great Burnet Saxifrage.\nIn woods, and among bushes in shady places, flowering in July. In Hallinghall Wood near Loughborough. In Stocking Wood, and the hedges adjoining, near Leicester.\n\nThe Pimpinella saxifraga minor is very common with us in dry pastures, and upon banks, about hedges.\n\nLinnaeus, Royen, and Ludwig, join these two species together, on supposition that they do not differ\ndiffer essentially. Haller keeps them separate, as not having seen the effect of culture upon them. Great deference is due to the opinion of such eminent botanists, and who have had such great opportunities for observation: the difference however is very remarkable, and we have seen them in the fields keeping that difference, when growing together upon the same soil.\n\nThe root of this plant is one of the ingredients in the Pulvis Ari compositus of the shops, and is a simple much esteemed by some of the German physicians, particularly by the followers of Stahl. Very few of our herb-gatherers know this plant, but produce the root of the common Sanguisorba or Burnet, or those of meadow Saxifrage, for it.\n\nTetragynia.\n\nParnassia, Gen. Plant.

The former might then have been called—Tormentilla foliis caulinis sessilibus, and the latter—Tormentilla foliis caulinis petiolatis.

The present practice, however, regards them but very little, except the ash-coloured ground Liverwort introduced into practice by Dr. Mead. Their economical uses are much more extensive: The orcella forms a branch of trade on account of its use in dying: but it is not the only species that is capable of being applied that way; there are others, which will tinge a purple and yellow colour: and it is to be wished that experiments were made with some of them for that purpose, as they are so plentifully found in our own nation. The common coralline moss is the principal food of the Rein-Deer, in winter, in the northern countries of Lapland, and even with this alone will they frequently become fat. We have hints of several other economical uses of this tribe of plants in the Flora Oeconomica, Amæn. Acad. Vol. I. taken from Linnæus's Itinera; which books we are deprived of the pleasure of reading on account of their being wrote in the Swedish tongue.
