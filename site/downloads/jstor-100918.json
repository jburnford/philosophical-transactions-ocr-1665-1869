At the present they intimate, that the reason why it hath not been observed but very late, is, that for a good while it was near the Sun; and when it was got clear of him, it was much obscured by the Moon.\n\nSince this, we have been informed by our Worthy and Learned Friend Mr. Isaac Newton, that about the 16th of March 1672, ft. v. he saw at night a dull Star South-west of Perseus, which, he saith, he now takes to have been that Comet, of which we gave him information: But he adds, that it was very small, and had not any visible Tail, which made him regard it no further; he fearing withall, that it will now be difficult to find it.\n\nAn Account of what hath been of late observed by Dr. Kerkringius concerning Eggs to be found in all sorts of Females.\n\nAlthough we have already (No. 70.) taken notice in brief of what the Inquisitive Kerkringius hath discoursed of, concerning Ovaria and Ova in all sorts of Femals; yet, to excite the more vigorously our eminent Anatomists here to a further search into this matter, as those of that profession in many foreign parts, as France, Italy, Holland, &c. employ themselves to find what truth there is in it; we thought, it would not be unwelcome to the Curious of all sorts of this Country, to give them here in English a particular description of what the said Kerkringius hath from his own Observations delivered\ndelivered on this subject: In the doing of which we shall not scruple to follow the French Philosophical Journals, published March 15, 21, and 22, to this effect;\n\nWhat Doctor Kerkring, (faith one of them) hath from his curious Observations advanced, viz. That Man hath his origin from an Egg, hath been very differently received, some appearing surprized at it, others rallying with it, and many being induced thereby to make further inquiry into it. This great diversity of sentiments made me think, I should do well for the satisfaction of all sorts of people, to insert here the particulars themselves, observed by the said Dr. Kerkring, and to add hereafter some Reflections, that may seem necessary to remove the principal difficulties occurring in this matter.\n\nBut since the things to be said do suppose some knowledge of the Parts, where these Eggs are formed and perfected, it will not be amiss, beforehand to cast your Eyes upon the Figures of Table II, of which the B represents a Matrix with its chief dependances: where\n\nB. is the Matrix.\nC. the Bladder of Urine, fastened to the neck of the matrix.\nD.D. the two testiculi, or rather the repository's, which contain the Eggs.\nE.E. the two Tubes of the matrix.\n\nF.F. the two vasa deferentia, steemed by Anatomists to convey semen testiculorum in uterum.\nG.G. the two vasa praeparantia, for preparing the matter, to be perfected in testiculis.\n\nFig. II. represents Eggs of different bigness, as Dr. Kerkring affirms to have found them in the testicles of a Woman.\n\nFig. III. shews a bigger Egg, such an one as we have found at Paris in a Woman of 40 years of age, and in those of a Maid of 18 years.\n\nFig. IV. exhibits smaller Eggs, of which we have found a good number in the testicles of a Cow.\n\nFig. V. represents an Egg, which D. Kerkring affirms to have opened three or four days after it was fallen into the matrix of a Woman, and in which he saw that little embryo marked B, whereof he found the Head begun to be distinguished from the\nthe Body yet without a distinct preception of the organs.\n\nFig. VI. shews a bigger Egg, which D. Kerkring did open a fortnight after conception, finding in it these particulars;\n\nA. a little Secondine.\nB. B. B. B. the membrane, Chorion, divided in four places.\nC. C. C. C. the membrane, Amnios, divided so too.\n\nD. the Navel-string, by which the Child is fastened to the Secondine.\nE. a Child of 14 days after Conception, in which the face begins to appear, together with the principal parts of the Body.\n\nFig. VII. represents the Skeleton of an Infant, found by the same in one of these Eggs three weeks after Conception.\n\nFig. VIII. exhibits the Skeleton of another Child, found also by him in an Egg, a month after Conception.\n\nFig. IX. represents the Skeleton of an Embryon, found by him in an Egg six weeks after Conception.\n\nThough this Opinion (saith Kerkringius) about the first formation of Man in an Egg, as that of all Fowl, is not common, yet 'tis true; and if any find it difficult to believe, he may cast his Eyes upon Fig. II. where he will see of those Eggs represented after the life, as I have found them myself in the body of many Women open'd by me.\n\nThese Eggs are to be met with, not only in the testicles of Women married, but also in those of Maids, even as young Hens will lay Eggs without any commerce with a Cock.\n\nThese Eggs are of the bigness of a pea, and they contain a glutinous liquor, which will be hard'n'd by the fire, just as the White and Yolk in other Eggs. The tast of them is flat and unpleasant enough; they are invested with one or two fine skins, which stretch themselves a little while after the Eggs are fallen into the Womb, and change into two membranes called Amnios and Chorion. And as these two membranes are always found afterwards, unwrapping the Child; so 'tis very probable, that the Eggs of Women are also cover'd with two skins from their beginning; though by reason of their fineness I could not distinctly see them.\n\nIt seems, that Falopius hath seen these Eggs before me; as appears in his Anatom. Observations. And as to their Use they have in Generation, it seems easy to be determined, by\nby reflecting on what that very expert Anatomist Thomas Wharton teacheth in his Treatise of Glandulls ch. 33. concerning the manner of Conception. For, according to him, *Semen Viri penetrat in tefies farniae per uteri Tubas*. Now there it is joyned with the Egg, in such a manner, which hath not been explained till now, but is never the less certain, and much resembling to what comes to pass in the other oviparous animals.\n\nThe Egg being made thus second, descends into the womb through the *vasa deferentia*, and in two or three days grows of the bigness of a black Cherry. When they fall down, they are a little bigger than we have represented them; but being soft, they are easily flattened, and never remain round. If in falling they are handled and slightly pressed, there will stick a little skin to the finger, which shews that 'tis not seed, nor anything like it, but of such Eggs, as we speak of. *Femina disjicunt hæc ova imprimis tempore menstruorum, vel in trecentum*.\n\nI have had (faith Kerckringius) an occasion favorable enough for examining that Germe of three or at most four daies, represented Fig. V. A married Woman dyed 3 or 4 daies post fluxum menstruum. I assisted at the opening of her Body, and having found in the matrix a little round mass of the bigness of a great black Cherry, I took the husband aside, and asked him, *Num à tempore fluxus menstruorum uxorium cognovisset?* And having received for answer, that he had, I pray'd him to let me carry home with me this little ball, which I had found in her womb. I was no sooner come home but I open'd it, and found, that nature had wrought with so much activity in so small a time, that one might already see the first lineaments of a Child, since we observed in it the head as distinct from the Body, and in the head we took notice of some traces of its principal organs. As for the rest of the Body, it was nothing as yet but a masse groly wrought, as you may see in this Figure.\n\nBut further, the Embrio represented in Fig. VI. was only of 15. daies, when in its Head there were noted the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, and Ears; and the Body began to have Leggs and Arms.\nArmes, as well distinguishable as appears in this Figure; which represents it just as it was given me. I durst not yet attempt to separate the Flesh from these little Bones, or rather from these small Cartilages, which in time become Bones; all these parts being yet too tender to make an accurate dissection of them.\n\nIn figure VII. is delineated a child, which is already furnished with all its Cartilages, though it had been conceived but three weeks. It being fallen into my hands, I attempted to sever the skin and the flesh from the Cartilages, holding the place of the Bones, and I succeeded well enough in it, and keep still by me the Skeleton thereof, truly represented in this Figure. The Head, wherein the Brain is to lodge and all man's wisdom, is nothing but a simple membrane inflated with wind or Spirits. The Armes are distinct from the Body, and the Hands have now their fingers perfectly distinct. One may easily count in this contexture of Cartilages, how many Ribbs there will be. And lastly the distinction of the Toes of the Feet is as perceptible, as that of the fingers of the Hands. But we must add withall, that all these parts are no longer than hairs, and consequently a great dexterity and niceness is to be used for displaying them.\n\nFigure VIII. represents a fetus of a moneth, having now the whole humane shape, and the Bones thereof firm enough in many places to support the parts. Behold the Figure well, which represents this little Engin in its natural size. It already in a manner sustains itself. The two Jaw-bones appear; the clavicles are formed; and all the Ribbs are very distinct, except the first and last; which are not wont to have, even in the second moneth, the consistence of Bones. One may see in the Armes the Joynts of the Shoulder-bones and of the Elbows; as also the Thighs and both the Leggs, together with their bones, called Focii; which I had not observed, when I wrote my treatise of the Generation of the Bones. All what you see of white in this eight figure, hath at this time the quality of bones. Where I have a fair occasion to enlarge and to discuss that great question, whence proceeds the hardness in Bones? And I could not give a better nor a more curious reason for it, than by alleging the doctrine, that serveth for a ground to all Chymistry;\nmistry; which is that there is an Acid Spirit, universally diffused through the world, which giveth solidity not only to Bones, but also Minerals and Metals, and to all Vegetables; penetrating all, fixing all, and being the Father of the Hardness and Solidity in all bodies.\n\nFig. IX. represents a Child of six weeks after Conception: where it is to be noted, that comparing together the Bones of divers foetus's it will be found, perhaps to admiration, that that which have been conceived but a little time after another, hath yet the bones in proportion twice as big. That which is here exhibited by Fig. IX. appears much lesser than another of two months, as appears in my Book of the Generation of Bones; but the Bones are for all that no less remarkable: for whatever hath the hardness and consistence of Bones in that, hath already the nature of Cartilages in this. The inferior jaw-bone is most observable in this Child of 6 weeks, marked A, it being at this age composed of six little bones, which when it is born are all joined together, and make but one.\n\nIf it be asked, How I come to know, that these degrees of growth come to pass exactly within those times recited; especially since in abortions we often see Embrio's of 4 months and above, that are not so big as those spoken of? I might answer by repeating all I said before, when I compared the proportions of those different Germes. To which I shall only add, that Embrio's which miscarry have often remain'd a long while in the Body before they came forth, or have lived there so sickly as not to draw perhaps half the nourishment, necessary for them, and therefore much less than else they would be.\n\nSo far Kerkringius; on whose discourse are made these Reflections by Monsieur Denys.\n\n1. That those Eggs are generated in Faminarum testiculis, and thence made to descend per tubam into the matrix, in cuitu, per vim spirituosam seminis masculi, per uteri tubam penetrantis.\n\n2. That those Eggs are of different bignesses; since those of the third Fig. represent one according to the life, as it was\nwas found with 9, or 10 lesser ones in a woman of 40 years of age. Such as were found by him in the testicles of a Cow, are duly exhibited in Fig. fourth. If any do wonder, that in so big an animal they should be so much smaller than in a Woman; he will have more cause to admire, that Women have them so little in comparison of those of Ducks, Hens, &c. the first beginnings of things not bearing always a proportion to their state of increase; as Beans and Peas (e.g.) whence grow plants but of a very middling size, are much bigger seeds, than the kernels of Apples and Pears, which do produce considerably big Trees. Besides, it may be, that Cows, when in their heat, may afford bigger Eggs. Mean time the reason why the Eggs of Fowl are always proportionably bigger than those of Women and of Quadrupeds, is, that they, when laid, must contain the matter not only for forming, but also for feeding the young animal.\n\n3. That this Opinion is not so new, as some imagine; since Fallopian in Observ. Anatom. Bartol. Anat. reform. l. i. c. 26. Riolan. Each. anat. l. 2. c. 37. Laurent. Anat. l. 7. c. 10. make mention of them.\n\nBut here we shall observe the True state of the Question out of the Journal of Monsieur Gaulois, saying, that the vesicles or Eggs in all sorts of females are to be considered in three conditions: 1. When they are fastened to the place where nature hath lodged them as in a repository. 2. When they are loosed from thence. 3. When they enclose the Embrion. The first of these, namely, that there are vesicles in all sorts of Females, fastened to their Bodies, is certain, and not new; as appears by the Authors just now quoted. It is also certain, that after conception, that which encloseth the Foetus, is almost like an Egg; but this is not new neither, seeing that Hippocrates hath observed it lib. de natura pueri; and Aristotle hath said it more than once, viz. l. 7. hist. Anim. c. 7. and l. 3. de gener. Anim. c. 9. To which also the moderns agree and amongst others the famous Harvey Exper. 68. de gener. Anim. The Question therefore is only, Whether these Vesicles, fastened to the body of Females, are loosed from it; and whether that kind of Eggs, wherein the Embrion is formed, is one of the vesicles loosed?\nloos'd? And here Kerkringius asserts the affirmative; as hath been seen above. Those that are of the contrary Opinion, say, that it is sure, that that bladder, like an Egg, in which the fetus is form'd, coms not from elsewhere; since 'tis known, that it is produced in the place of conception, and even how it is there produced; as appears out of Harvey, ibid. & tract. de Concept. Besides, say they, the vesicles found in the body of Women, are so fast'n'd there, that naturally they cannot be separated from thence; and suppos'd they were loos'd, there is in the same place, where they are, no passage large enough to get through. They add, that if you will give the name of Eggs to all the vesicles, to be found in the parts of Generation, there would also be Eggs in the body of Men, it being known, that at the side of the vasa deferentia there are found divers vesicles, which Anatomists compare to a Cluster of Grapes by reason of their figure.\n\nThe Reader, saith this Journalist, is left to decide this Question. He only intimates, that in the many Animals, dissected in the Royal Philosophical Academie at Paris there were never found any vesicles actually loose. But that, as to a passage for them, there had been, 3 years since, dissected a Woman, and found in each of the tube uteri a manifest cavity going into the bottom of the matrix: Adding, that though these conduits appear not open ordinarily, they may yet dilate themselves at the time of Conception: As the conduit, through which the Eggs of the Fowl do pass out of the ovarium into the matrix, is usually very close; but yet opens sometimes.\n\n4. To return to M. Denys, he observeth, that all other animate creatures (not to speak now of Plants) are produced by the meanes of Eggs; as Birds, Insects of all sorts, Fishes (of which last sort though Whales, Sea-Calves and Dolphins bring forth live creatures of their kind, yet they first breed them within their Bodies in Eggs;) And why not Quadrupeds also and the Femals of Mankind?\n\n5. As for Eggs, said by Kerkringius to have been found in Virginibus, the same M. Denys esteems that probable enough. For, saith he, though we had not the Instance of Hens, lay-\ning Eggs without any congress of a Cock; the place where they are bred shews enough, that Man contributes nothing to their production; all that he can do, being nothing but an attraction of the Eggs out of their Conservatory, and the making them descend into the uterus, ut ibi irrorentur à femine, & facunditatem acquirant; even as the Juices of the Earth do vivifie all the Plants by insinuating themselves into the grains, and penetrating their skins. And it may be, it is the alteration that befalls these Eggs, when they are retained too long, which causeth the abundance of Vapors and disorders, which other parts are accused of. On which occasion he alledgeth a notable example of a young Maid of quality, that lately died in the 18th year of her age; who was subject to very frequent Hysterical fits of vapors, of which she was one day assaulted with so great violence, that it cost her her life. Her Body being opened, Testiculus dexter erat flaccidus, & figure solitae; at sinister adeò tumidus & inflatus, ut Ovi Anatis aquaret magnitudinem: Eoque aperto, Ovum fuit intus repertum, Olivam figurà & magnitudine referens, & separatu nequaquam difficile. This, he saith, is still kept by Monsieur Charles.\n\nN. B. Since these particulars were sent to the Press, there came to the Publishers hands the very lately printed Book of that diligent and expert Anatomist Regnerus de Graaf, intitled Tractatus novus de Mulierum Organis generationi inferientibus; in which the above-recited difficulties, moved by M. Gaulois, and others also, are amply taken notice of, and ingeniously solved: Concerning which, we may by the next opportunity give the Curious Reader a fuller accompt; as also, wherein the said De Graaf differs from Kerkringius, in this matter, which, for want of time, could not be done at present.\n",
