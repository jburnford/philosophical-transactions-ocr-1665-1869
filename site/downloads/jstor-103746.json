Part of a Letter from the Reverend Mr. Wadde, Rector of Aynho in Northamptonshire, to Dr. Mead, concerning the difference in the Height of a Human Body, between Morning and Night.\n\nI have observ'd several Soldiers discharged for being a little under the Standard, and having experienced the difference of a Man's Height in the Morning and at Night, I mentioned it to an Officer, and thereby kept some Persons from being turn'd out of the Service. Since that Time I have measured Sir H. A...., Mr. C...., and a great many sedentary People, and Day-Labourers, of all Ages and Shapes, and find that Difference to be near an Inch. I try'd my self, when sitting, and found it in like manner; particularly, August 21. 1723. Weather warm, no Wind, at Eleven in the Morning I sat down, and fixed an Iron Pin so as to touch it, and that but barely. After that, I fatigued my self for half an Hour with a Garden-Roller, and the Consequence was, that at 12 Ho. 30 Min. I could not reach the Nail sitting, by about 5 Tents of an Inch, or the Breadth of one of the Rods of Hunt's Sliding-Rule. At 2 the same Day I wanted near six Tents of an Inch. On the 21st, at 6 Ho. 30 Min. in the Morning, I touched the Nail fully; and after the above-mentioned Exercise for only a Quarter of an Hour, at 7 Ho. 14 Min. I fell short almost as much as before. On the 27th, having sat up late with some Friends, I was faint, and felt my self heavy upon the Ground, and without any Spring, and at 9 that Morning I did not reach the Nail, though I had us'd no Exercise.\nExercise. I rid out, but could not reach it that Day. On the 28th I rid about four Miles; and whereas at 6 that Morning I reached the Nail, I had lost 6 tenths of an Inch by 8. September 19th I came from Oxford a little tired, and next Morning at 8 I wanted half an Inch. If I Study closely, though I never stir from my Writing-Desk, yet in 5 or 6 Hours I lose near an Inch. All the Difference I find between Labourers and sedentary People is, that the former are longer in losing their Morning Height, and sink rather less in the whole than the latter. I cannot perceive, that when the Height is lost, it can be regained by any Rest that Day, or by the Use of the cold Bath.\n\nI have not informed myself so well about Horses; my Mare comes Seven this Grass, is strong, short back'd, and well legg'd. I measured her before and after riding 20 Miles, April 30th, and could not perceive the least Difference in her Height.\n\nThe Alteration in the human Stature, I imagine, proceeds from the yielding of the Cartilages between the Vertebrae, to the Weight of the Body in an erect Posture.\n\nAYNH O, May 16, 1724.\n\nThis curious Observation has been confirmed by several Members of the Royal Society, and others, who have purposely tried the Experiment.",
