We see and admire the Effects of Electricity, and its stupendous Properties, every Day; which seems as it were an animating Soul to Matter. The Antients had a Notion that the Earth was a great Animal; probably from some Observations of Electricity; but certainly, when in our Days we feel these unusual and extraordinary Convulsions of Nature, it is a Lesson to us, to do our Duty toward that Great Being, who, by a Drop of Water can produce Effects so prodigious.

By a Letter I had from Mr. Oakes at Portsmouth, dated the 19th instant, he gives me an Account of the Inhabitants being alarm'd with a severe Shock of an Earthquake on Sunday the 18th at Six o'Clock in the Evening; and that it was felt stronger at the Common, which is about three Quarters of a Mile distant.
