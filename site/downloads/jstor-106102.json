B. The sign + signifies, that the degrees marked by the quicksilver were above 0, or the beginning of the division.\nThe negative sign — signifies, that the degrees were below 0, or the beginning of the divisions.\nThe thermometer was exposed in the open air to the North.\nThe hours are astronomical hours.\n\nExperi-\nExperiments on some Liquids.\n\n| Year | Month | Day | Hour | Minute | Description |\n|------|-------|-----|------|--------|-------------|\n| 1768 | Jan. 3 |     | 11   | 30     | I placed a wine glass half full of rack, another half full of rum, in a North window, to the open air: the next day, at the same hour, the rack was frozen to a thick jelly, with icy particles; the rum also to a jelly, but less thick. |\n|      |       |     | 4    | 50     | I exposed, as above, a wine glass, half full of cider: ditto of beer. Ditto of red wine, called Beaujenci. The cider began to freeze. Ditto consolidated. |\n|      |       |     | 5    | 13     | The beer began to freeze. Ditto consolidated. |\n|      |       |     | 5    | 12     | The wine began to freeze. Ditto nearly consolidated. |\n|      |       |     | 9    | 00     | The icy surface of the cider being broken, it froze over again, in three or four seconds, the ice forming, with a progressive motion, very perceptible to the eye. |\n|      |       |     | 9    | 15     | I exposed, as above, a wine glass half full of Malaga wine. Half ditto of Burgundy, called Migraine. Half ditto of Roussillon wine. Half ditto of spring water. Half ditto of cider-brandy. The water began to freeze. Ditto consolidated. |\n|      |       |     | 9    | 30     | The Malaga, Migraine, Roussillon, began to freeze. Ditto ditto ditto consolidated. |\n\nN. B.\nN.B. The brandy did not freeze; but the 6th at noon, the quantity was diminished, and some icy particles stuck to the glass, above the surface of what remained. I found, by weighing the above liquids hydrostatically, in a temperate state of heat, that the migraine, cyder, beaujenci, beer, and the water, were very nearly of the same specific gravity; and that a piece of gold, which weighed in the water - - 224.25 grains,\nweighed in the Malaga - - 224.00 ditto,\nin the Rouffillon - - 224.50 ditto,\nin the brandy - - 225.00 ditto.\n\nXXXIII.
