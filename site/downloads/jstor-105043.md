XXX. Mr. John Bradley's Observation of the Occultation of Venus by the Moon; communicated by Mr. James Short, F.R.S.

Read June 6. Mr. Gael Morris having favour'd me with the observation of the late occultation of Venus by the moon, taken at Greenwich with great exactness by Mr. John Bradley, I am induced to lay the same before the Royal Society, in order to shew its very near agreement with those phases, which Dr. Bevis observed at my house in Surry-street, allowing for the difference of meridians. I must take notice, that, besides the advantage of a six-foot reflector with a great magnifying power, which shew'd the planet's limb very well defined, he had also another, which the doctor had not, I mean
a very serene air, free from smoke, which enabled him to discern and keep sight of the moon during the whole occultation, so that he might observe the moment of the emersion with the same certainty, as that of the immersion: for Mr. Canton, with a reflector of 18 inches only, that day plainly saw the moon at his house in Spital-fields.
