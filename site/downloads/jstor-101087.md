Another Extract of a Letter written from Midleton in Warwickshire to the Publisher July 1st by Francis Willughby Esquire; about the Hatching of a kind of Bee, lodged in Old Willows.

The Cartrages that I got at A*bro* near a Twelfmonth ago, do now almost every day afford me a Bee; and I can hear them gnawing out their way before I see them: So that there is nothing irregular in the way of breeding of these Bees.

If any be laid so late, that they have not time enough to come to the state of Nymphas before Winter, they will most certainly die; and then it is no loss nor inconvenience, though their Cells be perforated.

This Accompt was communicated by the same Gentleman, that imparted the former, in a Letter written from Boston in New England Oct. 26. 1670. as followeth: Since
