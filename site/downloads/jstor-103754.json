  "text": "N.B. The foregoing Papers having been read before the Society thirty Years since, were then deposited by their Author in their Archives, and not published; he being sensible that he might have adventured ultra crepidam; and apprehensive least by some unguarded Expression he might incur the Censure of the Sacred Order. Nor had they now been printed, but at the Desire of a late Committee of the Society, who were pleased to think them not unworthy the Press.\n\nHere the Reader is desired to observe, that Mr. William Whiston's Book, entituled, A New Theory of the Earth, was not published till about a Year and a half after the Date hereof, and was not presented before June 24, 1696. to the Royal Society.\n\nFINIS.\n\nERRATUM.\nPag. 118. lin. 25, 26. read Relation.",
