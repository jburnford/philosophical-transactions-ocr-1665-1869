Stopping the hole E, there is a perpetual strong wind, issuing forth at G; and G being stopt, the wind comes out so vehemently at E, that it will, I believe, make a Ball play, like that at Frescati.\n\nAn Extract of a Letter, containing some Observations, made in the ordering of Silk-worms, communicated by that known Vertuoso, Mr. Dudley Palmer, from the ingenuous Mr. Edward Digges.\n\nI herewith offer to your Society a small parcel of my Virginian silk. What I have observed in the ordering of Silk-worms, contrary to the received opinion, is:\n\n1. That I have kept leaves 24 hours after they are gathered, and flung water upon them to keep them from withering; yet when (without wiping the leaves) I fed the worms, I observed, they did as well as those fresh gathered.\n\n2. I never observed, that the smell of Tobacco, or smells that are rank, did any waies annoy the worm.\n\n3. Our Country of Virginia is very much subject to Thunders: and it hath thundered exceedingly when I have had worms of all sorts, some newly hatched; some half way in their feeding; others spinning their Silk; yet I found none of them concern'd in the Thunder, but kept to their business, as if there had been no such thing.\n\n4. I have made many bottoms of the Brooms (wherein hundreds of worms spun) of Holly; and the prickles were so far from hurting them, that even from those prickles they first began to make their bottoms.\n\nI did hope with this to have given you assurance, that by retarding the hatching of seed, two crops of Silk or more might\nmight be made in a Summer: but my servants have been remiss in what was ordered, I must crave your patience till next year.\n\nAn Account of Micrographia, or the Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies, made by Magnifying Glasses.\n\nThe Ingenious and knowing Author of this Treatise, Mr. Robert Hook, considering with himself, of what importance a faithful History of Nature is to the establishing of a solid Systeme of Natural Philosophy, and what advantage Experimental and Mechanical knowledge hath over the Philosophy of discourse and disputation, and making it, upon that account, his constant business to bring into that vast Treasury what portion he can, hath lately published a Specimen of his abilities in this kind of study, which certainly is very welcome to the Learned and Inquisitive world, both for the New discoveries in Nature, and the New Inventions of Art.\n\nAs to the former, the Attentive Reader of this Book will find, that there being hardly any thing so small, as by the help of Microscopes, to escape our enquiry, a new visible world is discovered by this means, and the Earth shews quite a new thing to us, so that in every little particle of its matter, we may now behold almost as great a variety of creatures, as we were able before to reckon up in the whole Universe itself. Here our Author maketh it not improbable, but that, by these helps the subtilty of the composition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various texture of their matter, the instruments and manner of their inward motions, and all the other appearances of things, may be more fully discovered; whence may emerge many admirable advantages towards the enlargement of the Active and Mechanick part of knowledge, because we may perhaps be enabled to discern the secret workings",
