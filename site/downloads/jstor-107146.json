Fellow of Caius College.\n\nRead April 12, 1804.\n\nIn analytical investigation, two important objects present themselves: the concise and unambiguous expression of the conditions of a problem in algebraic language; and the reduction of such expression into forms commodious for arithmetical computation.\n\nIf the introduction of the new calculi, as they have been called, has extended the bounds of science, it has enormously increased its difficulties, in their number and magnitude. The differential forms that can be completely integrated, occur in few problems only, and those of small moment. In physical astronomy, the investigations give rise to differential expressions, which call forth all the resources of the analytic art, even for their approximate integration.\n\nFor the integration of differential expressions that, by the process of taking the differential, can be derived from no finite algebraic form, recourse is had to infinite series: thus, if the expression be $dx \\cdot fx$, and there is no quantity $Fx$, such that $dx \\cdot fx = d(Fx)$: $fx$ is put $= f((x - a) + a) = f(x - a) + df(x - a) \\cdot a + P^2 f(x - a) a^2 + \\&c.$ and $\\int dx \\cdot fx = \\int dx \\cdot f(x - a) + \\int dx \\cdot df(x - a) + \\int dx \\cdot P^2 f(x - a) \\&c.$ or,\nputting $fx = f(a + x - a)$, the integral of $dx \\cdot fx$ is calculated from the series $\\int dx \\cdot fa \\cdot (x - a) + \\int dx \\cdot df_a \\cdot (x - a)^2 + \\&c.$\n\nBut, although the integrals of many expressions can thus be exhibited, yet such series are useless for the purpose of arithmetical computation, except their terms continually decrease, and except the limits of the ratio of the decrease of the terms can be determined; and the invention of series adapted to arithmetical computation, has not been the least of the difficulties encountered by modern analysts.\n\nAlthough the differential expressions that admit no finite integration have not been reduced into classes, yet there are some, from their simplicity, and frequent occurrence in analytical investigation, more conspicuously known and attentively considered: such are the expressions $\\frac{dx}{1+x}$, $\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$; and the computation of their integrals, in other words, is the determination of the logarithms of numbers, and the lengths of circular arcs.\n\nThe necessity of calculating the integrals of expressions such as $\\frac{dx}{1+x}$, $\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, must soon have obtruded itself on the attention of the early analysts: for several expressions, as $\\frac{dx}{1-x^2}$, $\\frac{dx}{x\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, $\\frac{dx}{1+x^2}$, $\\frac{dx}{x\\sqrt{x^2-1}}$, &c. apparently dissimilar, are easily reduced to the forms $\\frac{dx}{1+x}$, $\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$; and besides, the difficulty of integrating a variety of forms, is soon reduced to that of the integration of $\\frac{dx}{1+x}$, $\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$: such, for instance, are the forms $\\frac{dx}{x\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, $\\frac{dx}{x^3\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, and all that are comprehended under $\\frac{dx}{x^{2m+1}\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$; the forms $\\frac{x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, $\\frac{x^4 dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, &c. and all that are comprehended under $\\frac{x^{2m} dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$.\nIt is on the grounds of convenience of calculation, and of systematic arrangement, that differential expressions, such as have been just exhibited, are resolved into a series of terms $Pdx + P'dx + P''dx + \\&c. + Q \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, where $Pdx + P'dx$, $P''dx$ are integrable; for, remove those grounds, and it will be difficult to assign a reason why $\\frac{x^{2m+1}}{2m+1} + \\frac{x^{2m+3}}{2m+3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{x^{2m+5}}{2m+5} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 4} + \\&c.$ is not an integral of $\\frac{x^{2m} \\cdot dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$ equally exact as $-\\sqrt{(1-x^8)} \\left\\{ \\frac{x^{2m-1}}{2m} + \\frac{1 \\cdot (2m-1)}{(2m-2) \\cdot 2m} \\cdot x^{2m-3} + \\frac{1 \\cdot (2m-1) \\cdot (2m-3)}{(2m-4) \\cdot (2m-2) \\cdot 2m} \\cdot x^{2m-5} + \\&c. \\right\\} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots 2m-1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdots 2m} \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$.\n\nIn the application of the differential calculus to curve lines, after making certain arbitrary assumptions, it appears that hyperbolic areas, and arcs of circles, may be computed from the integrals of the expressions $\\frac{dx}{1+x}$, $\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$; the integrals of which are in fact afforded by the several methods that relate to the quadratures of the circle and hyperbola; and mathematicians, either for the sake of embodying in some degree their speculations, or from a notion of a necessary connexion subsisting between circles, hyperbolas, and the integrals of $\\frac{dx}{1+x}$, $\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$, have expressed the integrals by the arcs and areas of those figures. Although the computation of the integrals, is totally independent of the existence of the figures, and of their properties, yet it is curious, that the simplest transcendental expressions of analysis, should express parts of the simplest figures in geometry.\n\n* This series arises from expanding $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, and from integrating each term multiplied into $x^{2m}$, $dx$.\nIn analytical investigation, after \\( \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} \\) \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\), the transcendental expression, next, in point of simplicity, is \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2} \\right)} \\);* in a particular application, this differential represents the arc of an ellipse,\\(\\dagger\\) a figure, next, in point of simplicity, to the circle.\n\nMany differential expressions depending, for their integration, on the integral of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2} \\right)} \\), it became necessary to exhibit it, for all values of \\( x \\) and \\( e \\). A problem in consequence arose, of no small difficulty, named, analogously to the naming of \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\), the rectification of the ellipse. In the prosecution of the researches to which this problem led, it was discovered that the hyperbola might be rectified by means of the ellipse, or, to speak correctly, and without the employment of figurative language, it was discovered that the transcendental expression \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{e^2 x^2-1}{x^2-1} \\right)} (e > 1) \\) might be made to depend, for its integration, on that of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2} \\right)} e < 1 \\).\n\nThe integration of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2} \\right)} \\) does not depend more on the length of an ellipse, than it does, on the time of the vibration of a pendulum in a circular arc, or on the attraction of a spheroid; but, in each of these problems, it occurs as an analytical phrase, an expression in symbolical language, the exact meaning of which it is necessary to know. If the meaning be determined for one case, it is for all three; and hence, with the rectification of\n\n\\* \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2 x^2)}} \\) is as simple an expression: they are considered together in the following pages.\n\n† The ellipse admits of an easy mechanical description; and, considered as a section of the cone, was admitted by the ancient geometricians into plane geometry.\nthe ellipse, a problem by itself unimportant, the solutions of other problems, are intimately connected; and, with this object in view, the determination of the length of a curve line, mathematicians have enriched analysis with several curious artifices, and valuable methods.\n\nTo determine the integrals of \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\), \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}\\right)} \\), it is necessary to expand them into series. The difficulty is, to expand them into series that converge: the determination of the integral of \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\) ought to precede that of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}\\right)} \\); indeed, in most of the series that represent the latter, \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\) is involved as a term, and is supposed to be known. The determination of each integral presents a curious circumstance, in the correspondence of certain geometrical properties and analytical artifices; for instance, the theorem for the tangent of the sum of two circular arcs, affords, analytically, a means of computing the length of the arc; and, conversely, the analytical artifice* by which the integral of \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\) is computed; translated, leads to the\n\n* The method of deducing the value of \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\) between the values of \\( x, o \\) and \\( 1 \\), independently of any reference to a circle, is as follows.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \\frac{du'}{\\sqrt{1-u'^2}} + \\frac{du''}{\\sqrt{1-u''^2}} \\) then \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} = \\int \\frac{du'}{\\sqrt{(1-u'^2)}} + \\int \\frac{du''}{\\sqrt{(1-u''^2)}} + C \\), and, expressing the integrals by their exponential expressions, we may deduce (see Phil. Trans. 1802) \\( u' \\sqrt{(1-u'^2)} + u'' \\sqrt{(1-u''^2)} = x \\). Let \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( u' = u'' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), consequently \\( \\frac{2du'}{\\sqrt{(1-u'^2)}} = \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\), or twice the integral of \\( \\frac{du'}{\\sqrt{(1-u'^2)}} \\) between the values of \\( u', o \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), equals the integral of \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} \\) between the values of \\( x, o \\) and \\( 1 \\). Again, put \\( \\frac{du'}{\\sqrt{(1-u'^2)}} = \\frac{dv}{\\sqrt{(1-v^2)}} + \\frac{dv'}{\\sqrt{(1-v'^2)}} \\) \\( \\therefore \\) as before, \\( v \\sqrt{(1-v^2)} + v' \\sqrt{(1-v'^2)} = u' \\); put \\( u' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\) and \\( v' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\), consequently \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}} = 2 \\int \\frac{dv'}{\\sqrt{(1-v'^2)}} \\) (contained between the values of \\( v', o \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\)).\n\nMDCCCIV. G g\nproperties of the sines, and tangents, of circular arcs. Again, Fagnani's theorem, by which a right line is assigned equal to the difference of two elliptic arcs, affords a method of arithmetically computing the length of the ellipse; and, conversely, the analytical artifice by which the integral of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\) is computed; translated into geometrical language, becomes Fagnani's theorem. And again, the analytical resolution of\n\n\\[\n\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} = Au' + Bu'' + P \\int du' \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e'^2 u'^2}{1-u'^2}} + Q \\int du'' \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e''^2 u''^2}{1-u''^2}},\n\\]\n\n(where the integrals, on account of the\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{dv}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}} \\quad \\text{(contained between the values of } v, 0 \\text{ and } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}),\n\\]\n\nwhich latter series, from the smallness of \\( v, v' \\), converge with considerable rapidity; or the latter part thus, put \\( v = \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{1+z^2}}, v' = \\frac{z'}{\\sqrt{1+z'^2}}, u' = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{1+y^2}}, \\text{ then } \\frac{x+z'}{1-zz'} = y, \\text{ and } \\int \\frac{dy}{1+y^2} = \\int \\frac{dz}{1+z^2} + \\int \\frac{dz'}{1+z'^2}.\n\\]\n\nNow, if \\( u' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, y = 1,\n\\]\n\nif \\( v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}, z = \\frac{1}{2},\n\\]\n\nif \\( v' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}, z' = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\)\n\nConsequently, the integral of \\( \\frac{dy}{1+y^2} \\) (between the values of \\( y, 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\)) \\( = \\int \\frac{dz}{1+z^2} \\)\n\n(between the values of \\( z, 0 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)) \\( + \\int \\frac{dz'}{1+z'^2} \\) (between the values of \\( z', 0 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)),\nand consequently, \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\) (between \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\)) \\( = 2 \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 2^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 2^5} - \\&c. \\right\\}\n\\]\n\n\\( + 2 \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{3 \\cdot 3^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 3^5} - \\&c. \\right\\} \\) which is, in fact, Euler's method of determining the periphery of a circle. Now, from this analytical artifice of putting the integral of \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \\int \\frac{du'}{\\sqrt{1-u'^2}} + \\int \\frac{du''}{\\sqrt{1-u''^2}}, \\) by which means its arithmetical value is computed, may be deduced those theorems which relate to the sines, and tangents, of the sum and difference of arcs, &c. by translating the formula \\( u'\\sqrt{1-u'^2} + u''\\sqrt{1-u''^2} = x \\) into geometrical language.\nsmallness of $e'$, $e''$, are readily computed,) translated into the language of geometry, expresses a curious relation between the arcs of three ellipses, the excentricities of which vary according to a certain law.\n\nHence it appears, that there are two different methods by which the analytic art may be advanced; either by artifices peculiarly its own, or by aid drawn from the properties of figures and curve lines; if, for instance, Fagnani's theorem be proved for an ellipse, by processes purely geometrical, then, such a theorem, expressed in analytical language, becomes immediately a means of computing the integral of $dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}}$; or if, by reasonings strictly geometrical, a relation can be established between the arcs of three ellipses, whose excentricities vary according to a certain law, then, by expressing such a relation in the signs of algebra, the integral of $dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}}$ may be computed by means of the integrals of $du' \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e'^2 u'^2}{1-u'^2}}$, and of $du'' \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e''^2 u''^2}{1-u''^2}}$; which integrals can be found more readily than the original integral, by reason of the quicker convergency of the series into which the differential expressions may be expanded, $e'$ and $e''$ being less than $e$.\n\nOne main object of the present paper is, to exhibit the integral of $dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}}$ for all values of $e$, and to reduce other integrals to it. Much has been already done on this subject. The researches of mathematicians on the length and comparison of elliptic arcs, are extended over the surface of many memoirs; yet I hope to have something to add in point of invention, and more in point of arrangement and simplicity of expression. The labours of future students will surely be lessened, if it be\n\nG g 2\nshown, that several methods, apparently distinct and dissimilar, because expressed in different language, are fundamentally, and in principle, the same.\n\nThe simplest mode, and the first that occurred to mathematicians, of finding the value of \\( \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\) was, to expand the differential expression into a series of terms ascending by the powers of \\( e \\), and to take the integral of each term. This method, however, is very imperfect; for, if \\( e \\) be nearly \\( = 1 \\), the series converges so slowly as to be unfit, or at least very incommodious, for arithmetical computation. It became necessary then to possess a series ascending by the powers of \\( 1 - e^2 \\); and such a series was first given by Euler, in his Opuscula, published at Berlin in 1750; and it must be manifest, that there can be no one single series, ascending by the powers of \\( e \\), or by powers of the same function \\( e \\), that can in all cases represent its value.\n\nI purpose to consider the several series that represent the value of \\( \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\),\n\nwhen \\( e \\) is small,\n\nwhen \\( e \\) is nearly \\( = 1 \\), or, when \\( \\sqrt{1-e^2} \\) is small,\n\nwhen \\( e \\) is \\( < \\sqrt{1-e^2} \\) and \\( < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\),\n\nwhen \\( e \\) is \\( > \\sqrt{1-e^2} \\) and \\( > \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\),\n\nwhen \\( e \\) and \\( \\sqrt{1-e^2} \\) are equal, or when each equals \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nThe series for the first and second cases, I shall deduce, because I wish to consider the subject in its fullest extent; but those series, when we regard practical commodiousness, are superseded by the methods by which the \\( \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\) is to be found, in the third and fourth cases. Two methods then, are only requisite for finding the integral in all the values of \\( e \\); for the integral\nin the last case may be found, with nearly equal convenience, by either of the methods in the two preceding cases.\n\nFor the sake of conciseness, I employ the symbol $D$ to denote the numeral coefficients of the terms arising from the expansion of $(1 - x)^m$; thus, $D^1 m$ signifies $m$; $D^2 1^m$, $m \\cdot m - 1$; $D^3 1^m$, $\\frac{m \\cdot (m-1) \\cdot (m-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}$; $D^n 1^m$ signifies $\\frac{m \\cdot (m-1) \\cdot (m-2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (m-n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n}$,\n\nand consequently, in particular values of $m$ and $n$, $D^3 \\frac{1}{2}$ signifies $\\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6}$; $D^4 \\frac{1}{2}$ signifies $-\\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8}$; $D^3 x \\frac{1}{2}$ signifies $-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6}$;\n\n$D^4 x \\frac{1}{2}$, signifies $\\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8}$; &c.\n\nEmploying, therefore, this notation in the expansion of $\\sqrt{(1 - e^2 x^2)}$, we have $dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - e^2 x^2}{1 - x^2}} = dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1 - x^2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - D_1 e^2 x^2 + D^2 e^4 x^4 - D^3 e^6 x^6 + \\text{&c.} \\right)$, and the $(n+1)$th term is\n\n$D^n e^{n+2} \\cdot x^{2n} \\cdot dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1-x^2}}.$\n\nNow, $d(x^{2n} \\sqrt{1-x^2}) = (2n-1) \\frac{x^{2n-2} dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} - 2n \\frac{x^{2n-1} dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$; hence,\n\n$F(x^{2n} dx) = -\\frac{1}{2n} x^{2n-1} \\sqrt{1-x^2} + \\frac{2n-1}{2n} \\int \\frac{x^{2n-2} dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$\n\n$\\quad = -\\frac{1}{2n} x^{2n-1} \\sqrt{1-x^2} + \\frac{2n-1}{2n \\cdot 2n-2} x^{2n-3} \\sqrt{1-x^2}$\n\n$\\quad + \\frac{(2n-1)(2n-3)}{2n \\cdot 2n-2} \\cdot \\int \\frac{x^{2n-4} dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}};$\n\nconsequently, continuing the reduction,\n\n$F(x^{2n} dx) = -\\sqrt{1-x^2} \\left\\{ \\frac{x^{2n-1}}{2n} + \\frac{(2n-1)}{2n \\cdot 2n-2} \\cdot x^{2n-3} + \\text{&c.} \\right\\}$\n\n$\\quad + \\frac{(2n-1)(2n-3)}{2n \\cdot 2n-2} \\cdot \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} (\\Phi).$\n\nHence, putting for $n$ the several values $0, 1, 2, 3,$ &c. we have\n\n$Fdx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} = \\Phi$\n\n$\\quad - D_1 e^2 \\left\\{ x\\sqrt{1-x^2} |_{\\frac{-x}{2}} + \\frac{\\Phi}{2} \\right\\}$\n\n$\\quad + D^2 e^4 \\left\\{ -\\frac{x}{3}\\sqrt{1-x^2} - \\frac{3x\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{4 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}}{2} \\cdot \\phi \\right\\}$\n\n$\\quad + \\text{etc.}$\n\\[\n-\\frac{D^3}{c} \\left[ \\frac{-x^5 \\sqrt{1-x^2}}{6} - \\frac{5x^3 \\sqrt{1-x^2}}{6 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot x \\sqrt{1-x^2}}{6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\phi}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6} \\right] + \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nHence, if the integral of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\), between the values of \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\), be required, putting \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 14159}{2} = \\text{value of } \\phi \\), or of \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\), when \\( x = 1 \\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\quad (\\text{from } x = 0 \\text{ to } x = 1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left[ 1 - D_1 \\frac{1}{2} e^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + D_2 \\frac{1}{2} e^4 \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 4} - D_3 \\frac{1}{2} e^6 \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6} + \\text{&c.} \\right] (1)\n\\]\n\nor, developing the symbolical coefficients \\( D_1 \\frac{1}{2}, D_2 \\frac{1}{2}, \\text{&c.} \\)\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{2 \\cdot 2} e^2 - \\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{2 \\cdot 4} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 4} e^4 - \\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6} e^6 - \\text{&c.} \\right]\n\\]\n\nwhich series has been given by several authors, Simpson, Euler, Animadversiones in Rect.

But it also appears, that the property of the bisection of the ellipse, established geometrically, ought not to be regarded as a merely curious and beautiful property, since, by its aid, the length of the elliptic quadrant may be computed. Several other properties, considered hitherto in the light of curious and speculative truths, translated, would appear analytical artifices, and in computation practically useful.\n\nBy the preceding series, the integral of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\) may be computed, when \\( e \\) is nearly = 0 or 1. It is necessary, however, to possess a method of computing the integral when \\( e \\) is of mean value; and the methods I am about to exhibit, are such as to supersede the use of the two series ascending by the powers of \\( e \\) and \\( b \\); in other words, from two similar methods, in all values of \\( e \\) between 0 and 1, the integral may be commodiously computed.\n\nThe principle of the method is this, if \\( df = dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\); then,\n\n* This theorem of Fagnani has lately been very neatly demonstrated, by a most skilful mathematician, Mr. Brinkley, in the Irish Transactions, by a geometrical process, but not without the use of prime and ultimate ratios.

M. LAGRANGE is, I believe, the original author.\n\nWhen \\( x \\) is called the sine of an arc \\( \\theta \\), \\( dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\) may be expressed by \\( d\\theta \\sqrt{(1-e^2 \\sin. ^2\\theta)} \\), \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2 x^2)}} \\), by \\( \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{(1-e^2 \\sin. ^2\\theta)}} \\). LAGRANGE, Fonct. Analyt. p. 90, has treated of the integrals of these expressions; as has LEGENDRE, Mem. de l'Acad. p. 663, and LACROIX, Traité du Calcul diff. Vol. II. page 454.\n\nThe results obtained by these authors, may easily be deduced from the substitution of \\( x \\sqrt{\\frac{1-x^2}{1-e^2 x^2}} = v \\sqrt{\\frac{1-v^2}{1-e^2 v^2}} \\). Some of these results may appear curious; but I apprehend, what is chiefly necessary for the solutions of problems in physics and astronomy, into which the expressions \\( \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2 x^2)}} \\), \\( dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} \\) enter, is a method of approximating to their integrals.\n\nA certain method of approximating to these integrals, has been given in the preceding pages. In different applications, its expression may be varied; thus, \\( f \\) is transformed into an expression involving \\( f', f'' \\), where \\( f', f'' \\), can be more easily computed than \\( f \\); express this transformation with reference to an ellipse, and it appears that the length of one ellipse may be estimated, from the lengths of two ellipses of different eccentricity. Again, \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2 x^2)}} \\), in order to be computed, is transformed into\nof certain differential Expressions, &c.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+e'}{2} \\int \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{(1-u^2)(1-e^2u^2)}}, \\text{ or into } \\frac{(1+e')(1+e'')}{2} \\cdot \\int \\frac{du''}{\\sqrt{(1-u'^2)(1-e'^2u'^2)}},\n\\]\n\n&c. but \\( \\int \\frac{mdx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2x^2)}} \\) (m a constant quantity) expresses the time of vibration of a pendulum in a circular arc; consequently, the time of vibration of one pendulum may be estimated from the time of vibration of another pendulum, vibrating in a different arc; and, generally, corresponding to relations established between abstract quantities \\( f, f', f'' \\), &c. will be found properties subsisting between those subjects, of which, in particular applications, \\( f, f', f'' \\), &c. become the exponents and expressions.\n\nA certain method for computing the integral of \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1-e^2x^2}{1-x^2} \\right)} \\) (\\( df \\)) being obtained, in a systematic treatise, the next business of the analyst would be, to show what differential forms depended for their integration on that of \\( df \\).

In an analytical point of view, there is nothing curious or remarkable in the reduction of such a form to \\( dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1-e^2x^2}{1-x^2} \\right)} \\), and other quantities that can be integrated; but, with certain conditions, \\( \\int dx \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{e^2x^2-1}{x^2-1} \\right)} \\) represents the arc of an hyperbola; consequently, announcing the analytical result in geometrical language, the hyperbola may be\nrectified by means of an ellipse; which property is to be reckoned curious, I conceive, because the ellipse and hyperbola are sections of the same solid cone; for, otherwise, I do not perceive why it is more curious, that an hyperbola should be rectified by means of an ellipse, than that any other curve, whose arc $= F$, ($F$ an integral dependent on $\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{x^2-1}}$) should be rectified by means of an ellipse.\n\nIn order to integrate $dx \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 x^2 - 1}{x^2 - 1}}$ by means of $\\int dy \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 y^2}{1-y^2}}$, put $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\frac{z^2}{e^2}}{1-z^2}}$; then, when $z = 0$ $x = 1$, and when $z = 1$ $x = \\infty$, and $dx \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 x^2 - 1}{x^2 - 1}} = \\frac{(1-m^2) dz}{(1-z^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\sqrt{(1-m^2 z^2)}}$, \\{ putting $m = \\frac{1}{e}$ \\}; consequently, $\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 x^2 - 1}{x^2 - 1}}$ ($e > 1$ \\} between the values of $x = 0$ and $x = \\infty$ = integral of $\\frac{(1-m^2) dz}{(1-z^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\sqrt{(1-m^2 z^2)}}$ between the values of $z = 0$ and $z = 1$.\n\nNow, $d \\left\\{ z \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 z^2}{1-z^2}} \\right\\} = dz \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 z^2}{1-z^2}} - \\frac{(1-m^2) dz}{\\sqrt{(1-z^2)(1-m^2 z^2)}} + \\frac{(1-m^2) dz}{(1-z^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} (1-m^2 z^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$.\n\nHence, $\\int \\frac{(1-m^2) dz}{(1-z^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\sqrt{(1-m^2 z^2)}} = z \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 z^2}{1-z^2}} - \\int dz \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 z^2}{1-z^2}} + (1-m^2) \\int \\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{(1-z^2)(1-m^2 z^2)}}$;\n\nbut, if we put $\\int dz \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 z^2}{1-z^2}} = F$, $\\int d'z \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 z^2}{1-z^2}} = F'$,\n\n$m = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-m^2}}{1+\\sqrt{1-m^2}}, \\quad z = \\frac{2}{1-m} \\cdot z \\sqrt{\\frac{1-z^2}{1-m^2 z^2}}$.\n\nThen, by equation (a) page 240,\n\n$\\int \\frac{dz}{(1-z^2)(1-m^2 z^2)} = \\frac{2mz}{1-m^2} - \\frac{2F}{1-m} + \\frac{2F'}{1-m^2}$;\n\nconsequently, $\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 x^2 - 1}{x^2 - 1}} = \\int \\frac{(1-m^2) dz}{(1-z^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\sqrt{(1-m^2 z^2)}}$.\nwhich, in fact, is Landen's theorem; for \\( \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 x^2 - 1}{x^2 - 1}} \\) represents the arc of an hyperbola, semiaxes 1 and \\( \\sqrt{e^2 - 1} \\), and F, F, the arcs of two ellipses.\n\nIn an analytical point of view, the latter part of this solution is unnecessary; for the problem is completely resolved, when it is proved that\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{(1-m^2) \\, dx}{(1-x^2) \\sqrt{(1-m^2 x^2)}} = z \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} - \\int dz \\sqrt{\\frac{1-m^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} + (1-m^2) \\int \\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-m^2 x^2)}}.\n\\]\n\nIf the differential of \\( x \\sqrt{\\frac{1-x^2}{1-e^2 x^2}} \\) be taken, it appears that\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2 x^2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{1-e^2} \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}} - e^2 \\cdot x \\sqrt{\\frac{1-x^2}{1-e^2 x^2}};\n\\]\n\nand hence may be deduced a differential equation of the second order, similar to the one given in page 236.

These integrals, it is necessary to compute; and methods have been given for that purpose for all values of \\(e\\), and consequently for all values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). If the coefficients are to be determined by deriving \\(A, B\\) from \\(A', B'\\), &c., the best method to be followed, is that given by Mr. Ivory, who determines the coefficients, when the index \\(2m+1 = -1\\), in fact, by integrating \\(\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2 x^2)}}\\), \\((dF)\\), or \\(\\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{(1-e^2 (\\sin \\theta)^2)}}\\), on which \\(A\\) depends, and \\(dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2 x^2}{1-x^2}}\\) \\((df)\\), or \\(d\\theta \\sqrt{(1-e^2 (\\sin \\theta)^2)}\\), on which \\(B\\) partly depends.*\n\nThe author last mentioned, in his valuable Paper inserted in the Edinb.

Transactions, Vol. V. p. 256. But the great difficulty of the problem does not consist in deriving the coefficients from one another, but in computing the value of the first and second; and, for this end, a series that simply expresses the expansion of\n\n\\[\n(1 - e^2 (\\cos \\theta)^2)^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}}\n\\]\n\nmust be inadequate, at least, it cannot be commodious and general.\n\nClairaut has given a peculiar method for finding A, Mém. de l'Acad. 1754, p. 546. Arbogast, Calcul des Derivations, p. 359, has given a form for the expansion of\n\n\\[\n(1 - c \\cdot \\cos \\theta)^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}},\n\\]\n\nwhich agrees with Lacroix's, Calc. int. p. 121; but the expansion is inconvenient, for reasons already stated, for the purposes of arithmetical computation.\n\nIf we join together certain parts of Legendre's Memoir, we shall obtain a complete solution of the problem of the expansion of\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab (\\cos \\theta))^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}};\n\\]\n\nfor he shows, that E, the integral of \\( d\\theta \\cdot \\sqrt{(1 - e^2 (\\cos \\theta)^2)} \\) may always be resolved into similar integrals E', E\", or \"E, \"E, or, by continuing the resolution, into E'', E''', or \"E, \"E, &c. and, consequently, he shows how E may, in all values of \\( e \\), be computed; and moreover, he shows that the integral of\n\n\\[\n(\\cos \\theta)^n (1 + \\alpha \\cdot \\cos \\theta)^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}} d\\theta,\n\\]\n\nmay be always reduced to that of\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\alpha \\cdot \\cos \\theta)^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}} d\\theta,\n\\]\n\nand therefore to the integral of\nof certain differential Expressions, &c.\n\n\\[ d\\theta \\sqrt{1 + a \\cos \\theta} \\text{ and } \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{1 + a \\cos \\theta}}. \\]\n\nNow, the coefficient affecting\n\n\\[ \\cos n\\theta = af \\cos n\\theta \\cdot d\\theta (1 - c \\cos \\theta)^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}}, \\quad (a \\text{ a constant quantity,}) \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\cos n\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (2 \\cos \\theta)^n - n(2 \\cos \\theta)^{n-2} + \\frac{n(n-3)}{2} (2 \\cos \\theta)^{n-4} - \\&c. \\right] \\]\n\nE, E', &c., LEGENDRE calls ellipses, because the differential of the arc of an ellipse may be represented by an expression as\n\n\\[ d\\theta \\sqrt{1 - e^2 (\\cos \\theta)^2}; \\]\n\nbut the problem of the expansion of\n\n\\[ (a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos \\theta)^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}} \\]\n\nrequires only the integrals of \\( \\frac{d\\theta}{R}, d\\theta \\cdot R; \\)\n\nthe determination of which integrals, is totally independent of ellipses, as it is, of all other curves.\n\nThat the determination of the coefficients A, B, &c. depended on the integral of \\( Rd\\theta, \\) which, in a particular application, represents the arc of a conic section, was known to D'Alembert. In the *Recherches sur differens Points importans du Systeme du Monde*, page 66, he proves that A, B, are respectively equal to \\( \\frac{2M}{c}, \\frac{2M'}{c}, \\)\n\n\\( c \\) being the semicircumference of a circle, and M, M', the integrals of\n\n\\[ dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{n}{2}}, \\text{ and } \\cos z \\cdot dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{n}{2}}, \\text{ when } z = \\frac{c}{z}; \\]\n\nwhich integrals depend, he says, on the rectification of the conic sections; he then adds a remark, which requires some comment and explanation. \"Tout se reduit donc à trouver par approximation,\n\n\"la rectification d'un arc donné dans une section conique; et c'est\n\n\"à quoi on peut parvenir aisément par différentes méthodes. Mais\n\n\"je ne m'étendrai pas davantage là-dessus, parce que cette manière\n\n\"de trouver les inconnues A et A', me paroit plus curieuse et plus\n\n\"géometrique que commode pour le calcul.\" p. 67. D'Alembert, therefore, rejects a method which has since been adopted: the reason, I presume to be this; if he had attempted to find the co-\n\nefficients by the rectification of the conic sections, he must have\n\nreduced the integrals of \\( dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{n}{2}}, \\cos z dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{n}{2}}. \\)\nto a series of terms, as $Z' + Z'' + Z''' \\&c.$ $+ \\int dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{1}{2}} + \\int \\frac{dz}{(a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$; and, after this reduction, he must have found the integral of $dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, which, as he then could only do by resolving it into a series, was a problem not more easy, than the finding of the integral of $dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{n}{2}}$ from its immediate resolution into a series; consequently, the reduction of $dz (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{n}{2}}$, into $Z' + Z'' + \\&c.$ would have been useless and unprofitable labour. Had a certain and easy method of computing $(a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ been known to D'Alembert, he would not have asserted the reduction of $\\int (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{n}{2}}$ into $Z' + Z'' + \\&c.$ $\\int (a + b \\cos z)^{\\frac{1}{2}} dz$, to be a method \"plus curieuse que commode.\"\n\nThe integral of $\\frac{x^4 dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$ furnishes an easy instance for illustration. Suppose it were necessary to compute it, a value of $x$ being given less than 1; resolve it into\n\n$$\\sqrt{(1-x^2)} \\left\\{ Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx \\right\\} + \\int E \\cdot \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}};$$\n\nthen, from such expression, may the integral be easily found, since we have tables that exhibit the value of $\\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$ for all values of $x$ between 0 and 1; but, if the zeal and ability of former computists had not enabled us, in all cases, to assign the value of $\\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$, it would be, practically, more easy and convenient, for a single instance, to compute an expression as $\\int \\frac{x^4 dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$ immediately from\n\n$$\\int x^4 dx \\left\\{ 1 - D_1 x^2 + D_2 x^4 - D_3 x^6 + \\&c. \\right\\},$$\n\nor $$\\frac{x^5}{5} - \\frac{D_1 x^7}{7} + \\frac{D_2 x^9}{9} - \\&c.$$ than from $\\sqrt{(1-x^2)} \\left\\{ Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx \\right\\} + \\int E \\cdot \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)}}$.\nsince, after this reduction, it would be necessary to compute\n\n\\[ E \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\text{ from } E \\left\\{ x - D_1 \\frac{x^3}{3} + D_2 \\frac{x^5}{5} - \\&c. \\right\\} \\]\n\nThese observations are, however, digressive; the problem, the expansion of \\( (a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos \\theta)^{\\frac{2m+1}{2}} \\), is, I conceive, completely resolved in the preceding pages, whatever be the ratio between the radii of the planets' orbits.*\n\nWhat I have advanced, on a former occasion, concerning the independence of analysis and geometry, is confirmed by the present reasonings and results. \\( \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^2}{1-x^2}}, \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 x^2-1}{x^2-1}}, \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-e^2 x^2)}} \\), have been computed, without the introduction of an ellipse, an hyperbola, an oblique cylinder, or a pendulum.\n\n* In the case of the new planets Ceres and Pallas, whose mean distances from the sun are nearly equal, the series (8), and the expression\n\n\\[ \\frac{(1+b)(1+\\&b) \\cdots (1+(m)b)}{z^m} \\cdot l. \\frac{4}{(m)b} \\] (F), will be very convenient, on account of the rapid convergency of the quantities, \\( b, \\&b, \\&c.; \\) and, in general, in estimating the disturbing forces of z planets, since \\( e' \\) is\n\n\\[ = \\frac{\\text{mean distance of nearest planet}}{\\text{mean distance of the more remote planet}}, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{1-e'}{1+e'}, \\text{ putting } b=e', e'=\\sqrt{2}-1=0.4142, \\&c. \\]\n\nhence, if \\( e' \\) be greater than 0.4142, &c. the series of terms \\( b, \\&b, \\&c. \\) decrease more rapidly than \\( e'', e''', \\&c. \\) and, consequently, the series (8), page 248, and the series\n\n\\[ \\frac{(1+b)(1+\\&b) \\cdots (1+(m)b)}{z^m} \\cdot l. \\frac{4}{(m)b}, \\]\n\nare to be used in determining the perturbations, when the planets are Mercury and Venus, \\( e'=0.53516076 \\)\n\nVenus and Earth, \\( e'=0.72333230 \\)\n\nVenus and Mars, \\( e'=0.4747320 \\)\n\nEarth and Mars, \\( e'=0.6530030 \\)\n\nJupiter and Saturn, \\( e'=0.54531725 \\)\n\nSaturn and Georgium, \\( e'=0.49719638 \\)\n\nCeres and Pallas,\nvibrating in a circular arc; and, as \\( \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^4}} \\) might have been computed, without the introduction of the Lemniscata.* I have stated the mode by which analysis may derive aid from geometry; the extent of the aid however is, I conceive, very small; remove the circle, ellipse, and parabola, curves whose properties have been the object of so much investigation, and we only create for ourselves unnecessary and circuitous operations, by introducing curves into the discussion of questions purely analytical. For the purposes of classification, however, curves may not be altogether useless.\n\nThe correspondence that has been shown, between the artifices of calculation and the properties of geometrical figures, may be thought, perhaps, curious or remarkable; and the reduction of several methods into one is, I presume, practically and scientifically useful. On similar reductions, the perfection of analysis, to a great degree, depends: for, a frequent result of a careful investigation is, the discovery that methods apparently different, because differently expressed, are founded on the same principle and fundamental notion; but, if examination and study thus diminish the seeming bulk of our knowledge, they, at the same time, increase its precision and purity.\n\n* See Euler's Memoir, Novi Comm.
