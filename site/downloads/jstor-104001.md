VII. Some Observations of Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites, made by Geo. Lynn, Esq; at Southwick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire; Communicated in a Letter to James Jurin, M.D. F.R.S. and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London.

SIR,

HEARING that some Foreigners enquired for Observations of the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellite, I have sent what I had of that Sort: They are indeed but few these two last Years, on account of my Absence during part of the Time for Observation, and also on account of the small Arc Jupiter has lately made above our Horizon. The Telescope I made use of is the same as formerly, having a thirteen Foot Object-Glass, with an Aperture of two Inches and four Tenths, and an Eye-Glass of two Inches and an half Focus. By apparent Time, at Southwick, near Oundle in Northamptonshire, Longitude West from London, 00 Deg. 30 Min. as follows:
