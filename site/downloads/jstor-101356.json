See Dr. Willis de Cerebro. c. 19. pag. 241. Edit. in 4°. and c. 15. p. 187.\n\nA Letter of Mr. Lister dated May 21. 1673. in York, partly taking notice of the foregoing Intimations, partly communicating some Anatomical Observations and Experiments concerning the unalterable Character of the Whiteness of the Chyle within the Lacteous Veins; together with divers particulars observed in the Guts, especially several sorts of Worms found in them.\n\nI come to your Letter, where the Analogy betwixt the Veins in Plants and the Nerves in Animals, hinted by Dr. Wallis, is a considerable notion, and I shall set myself a task e're long to examine them both again on purpose, and to give you my thoughts. In the mean time, I will entertain",
