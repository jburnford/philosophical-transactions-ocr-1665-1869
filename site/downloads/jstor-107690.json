S.\n\nRead May 16, 1822.\n\nThis has been a favourite subject with many of the most celebrated anatomists. The great Harvey, Malpighi, and John Hunter, have done more than any others in the advancement of this enquiry.\n\nHunter's observations were never rendered so complete as to induce him to publish them; but what he has done is open to the public, both in the preparations in his Collection, and in his Cabinet of Drawings.\n\nIn these last, the vesicle which begins near the rectum, and afterwards envelopes the embryo, is clearly made out.\n\nIn the year 1815, Mr. Dutrochet, an ingenious French anatomist, laid a Memoire upon this subject before the French Academie. Mr. G. Cuvier has given a Report upon this Memoire, but has not given the Memoire itself. He considers the author to be the first person who has clearly explained the rise and progress of the vesicle; but some of Mr. Hunter's drawings of it are dated 1773, the year I went to live in his house.\n\nAfter all that has been done, much is still wanting to render the investigation complete; and to promote this object, the following Observations and Drawings are brought before the Society.\n\nThe gelatinous molecule, from which the future embryo\nSir Everard Home on the changes the egg undergoes\n\nis to be formed, is originally placed on the surface of the yelk; it is found there before the yelk leaves the ovarium, and lies loose upon it, not being enveloped in any capsule.\n\nThe external membrane of the yelk is very thin and delicate, its surface is studded over with red dots, which disappear in its passage along the oviduct. When this is removed, there is a second thick and spongy covering under it, in which there is a natural aperture; and the areola, surrounding the molecule, is nothing more than the surface of the yelk, that is circumscribed by the margin of this aperture. No such aperture has been before taken notice of.\n\nThe molecule itself has a granulated appearance; in the centre it is made up of globules $\\frac{1}{2800}$ part of an inch in diameter, surrounded by circles of a mixed substance, consisting of about two-thirds of the same small globules, and one-third of larger oval globules, about $\\frac{1}{1600}$ part of an inch in length, and $\\frac{1}{2000}$ part in diameter; these last, in their figure, resemble the red globules of the blood in the bird in every respect, excepting their red colour. Besides the globules there is some fine oil, which appears in drops when the parts are immersed in water. Oval globules and oil are also met with in the yelk itself, but in small proportion, and without colour.\n\nAll these parts, except the red dots on the surface, are met with in the yelk on a smaller scale, even six days before it is completely formed.\n\nThe ovarial yelk-bag gives way at the middle line, farthest from the insertion of the blood-vessels, and the yelk drops out into the mouth of the oviduct.\n\nThe yelk-bag does not immediately close, although it con-\ntracts considerably: some time after it is nearly obliterated; and on the pedicle, the rudiments of a new yelk are formed.\n\nThe yelk-bags are exceedingly vascular; the outer membrane of the yolks is connected to them by vessels and fasciculi of fibres, but easily separated.\n\nThe yelk, while in the ovarium, has an oval form, and lies with its long axis towards the pedicle of the bag. See Plate XXXII. figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nIn its passage along the oviduct the yelk acquires the albumen, and before it comes to the lower end, the albumen is covered by a very fine membrane.\n\nIn this passage the thread-like substances, called by Mr. Hunter the poles, by others the chalazes, are formed; and terminate in the double membrane, which is added at the time the egg has reached the enlargement at the lower end of the oviduct. In the cloacus the shell is formed. If the egg is taken out before it has acquired a shell, it remains soft for several days; in one instance, after four days, it was so semi-transparent as to receive a yellow tint from the yelk. On puncturing the covering, the contents rushed out, but immediately resumed their form, being inclosed in the thin membrane of the albumen. The molecule with its areola, and the chalazes, were distinctly seen. The whole contents had less volume than the shell, particularly in the long axis, being truncate at both extremities. When immersed for an hour and half in distilled vinegar, the albumen and other parts had become somewhat coagulated. Plate XXXII. fig. 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nIn the new laid egg the appearances are exactly the same,\nSir Everard Home on the changes the egg undergoes whether it is impregnated or not. Plate XXXII. fig. 10, 11, 12.\n\nWhen the shell and membranes under it are removed from one side, the yolk appears to be kept in its place by the poles, although allowed to rotate upon its axis.\n\nThe gelatinous molecule, with its areola, is always found upon the highest point of the upper surface of the yolk. Whether this arises from the molecule, or from the areola being the lightest part of the yolk, has not been ascertained.\n\nWhen the hen begins to sit, a new laid egg, which has not been allowed to cool, will have the rudiments of the embryo formed some hours sooner than in the other eggs.\n\nHaving traced the formation of the egg itself through all the changes that take place from the time the yolk leaves the ovarium till it is impregnated, we are now to follow those changes that are met with during incubation till the embryo becomes a completely formed chicken.\n\nIn 4 hours after incubation the outer edge of the areola had become enlarged, and that part of it next the molecule appeared darker. One end of the molecule appeared like a white line, the first rudiments of the embryo. Plate XXXIII. fig. 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn 8 hours, the white line was found to be extended, and the rudiments of a brain and spinal marrow were formed, surrounded by a membrane, which afterwards becomes amnion.\n\nThe areola had extended itself, and the surface beyond the line which formed its boundary had acquired the consistence of a membrane, and had also a distinct line by which it was\ncircumscribed. This I shall call the outer areola. In the space between these two areolas, there were distinct dots of an oily matter. This extension of membrane to the outer areola lies under the inner membrane of the yelk, and can readily be removed entire. Plate XXXIII. fig. 4, 5, 6.\n\nIn 12 hours, the rudiments of the brain were more distinct, as well as of the spinal marrow. These parts were placed upon a black ground in vinegar, and hardened; the upper end showed the tuberculum annulare of the brain, from which passed down two semi-transparent lines resembling an appearance peculiar to the spinal marrow of the bird. Plate XXXIII. fig. 7, 8, 9.\n\nIn 16 hours, there was a farther advance in the structure of all these parts. Plate XXXIV. fig. 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn 24 hours, a still greater increase. Plate XXXIV. fig. 4, 5, 6.\n\nIn 36 hours, the head was turned to the left side. The cerebrum and cerebellum appeared to be distinct bodies; the iris was seen through the pupil of the eye. The intervertebral nerves were nearly completely formed; those nearest the head the most distinct. A portion of the heart was seen.\n\nAt this period, under the inner areola, apparently at the termination of the spinal marrow, a vesicle had begun to protrude. In some eggs it is seen earlier than in others, and has been observed before the heart had become visible. Plate XXXIV. fig. 7, 8, 9.\n\nIn 2 days 12 hours, the spinal marrow was found to have its posterior part enclosed; the auricles and ventricles of the heart were seen, the auricles filled with red blood. An arterial trunk from the left ventricle gave off two large\nvessels, one to the right side of the abdomen of the embryo, the other to the left, sending branches over the whole of the areolar membrane, which was bounded on each side by a large trunk carrying red blood; but the two trunks did not unite, there being a small space on one side rendering the circle incomplete.\n\nThe vesicle was somewhat increased in size; it lay in the lower part of the abdomen, the parietes of which were not yet formed. Plate XXXV. fig. 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn 3 days, the outer areola had extended itself over $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the circumference of the yolk, carrying the marginal arteries along with it to the outer edge, but diminished in size. The brain was much enlarged, consisting of four cavities containing a fluid, the cerebellum still the largest. The spinal marrow and its nerves were more perfectly formed. The eye appeared only to want the nigrum pigmentum.\n\nThe right ventricle of the heart contained red blood: the arteries could be traced to the head: the rudiments of the wings and legs were formed: the vesicle was farther enlarged, but its vessels did not carry red blood. It had forced its way out through the external covering of the yolk, and opened a communication through this slit, by which a part of the albumen was admitted to mix itself with the yolk, and give it a more oval form. At this period the embryo is generally found to have changed its position, and to be wholly turned on the left side. Plate XXXV. fig. 4, 5, 6.\n\nIn 4 days, the vesicle was more enlarged and more vascular, its vessels containing red blood.\n\nThe optic nerve and nigrum pigmentum of the eye were visible; the other parts had become more perfectly formed,\nThe outer areola had extended itself half over the yelk, which had now become still more encreased in size, a greater portion of albumen having become mixed with it. Plate XXXV. fig. 7, 8, 9.\n\nIn 5 days, the membranous bag that formed the vesicle had acquired a great size, and become exceedingly vascular in its coats; the cavity contained a fluid. The yelk had become thinner in its consistence, more of the albumen having been mixed with it. Plate XXXVI. fig. 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn 6 days, the vascular membrane of the areola had extended farther over the yelk. The vesicle at this time had suddenly expanded itself in form of a double night-cap over the yelk and its coverings, beginning to enclose the embryo.\n\nThis change is so rapid, that it has been with difficulty detected, and different accounts have been given of the mode in which it takes place.\n\nThe amnion contained water, in which the embryo floated, suspended by the vessels supplying the areolar and vesicular membrane.\n\nThe brain had become enlarged to the size of the body of the embryo: its vessels were distinctly seen. The two eyes equalled in size the whole brain: the marsupium was seen covered with nigrum pigmentum. The vessels of the cerebellum could be traced into the convolutions of the pia mater.\n\nThe parietes of the thorax and abdomen had begun to form; the wings and legs were nearly completely formed, as well as the bill. At this period muscular action was first noticed. Plate XXXVI. fig. 4, 5, 6.\n\nIn 7 days, the vesicle having extended over the embryo,\nhad begun to enclose the areolar covering of the yelk, and a pulsation was distinctly seen in the trunk that supplied the vesicular bag with blood. The pulsations were 79 in a minute while the embryo was kept in the temperature of 105°, but when the temperature was diminished the pulsation ceased, and when restored was reproduced. The pulsation was kept up, by attention being paid to the temperature, for 36 hours. Muscular action had become vigorous in the limbs.\n\nWhen the embryo was completely immersed, although the temperature of the water was 108°, the pulsations immediately ceased, the blood being no longer aerated. Plate XXXVI. fig. 7, 8, 9.\n\nIn 8 days, the anastomosing branches of the vesicular circulation had the arterial pulsation very strong in them. Plate XXXVII. fig. 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn 9 days, the vesicle had nearly enclosed the yelk, but not entirely; for when the embryo was turned upon its back, and the opposite surface examined, a portion of yelk was unenclosed, and beyond it some of the albumen was met with not mixed with the yelk. Plate XXXVII. fig. 4, 5, 6.\n\nIn 10 days, the vesicle was opened, and the upper half turned aside. When the amnion, which had become full of water, was opened and the embryo taken out, the thorax was found completely enclosed; the roots of the feathers were distinct, and the passage for the areolar as well as the vesicular vessels exposed.\n\nIn 14 days, the yelk remained out of the body. When the thorax and abdomen were opened, and the heart as well as the lobes of the liver turned aside, the trunks of the blood-vessels could be traced to the heart; but as the arteries\nimmediately after death become empty and the veins remain full, the vein from the vesicle, and that from the areola were the most conspicuous.\n\nIn 18 days, the greater part of the yelk was drawn into the body.\n\nIn 20 days, the chick was completely formed; the yelk was entirely drawn in, and only some portions of the membrane of the vesicle appeared externally. The yelk passed into the intestine a little way above the openings of the cœca.\n\nHaving traced the progress of the formation of the chick step by step, from the first appearance of the molecule found on the yelk before it leaves the ovarium to the complete evolution of all its parts, and its leaving the shell, I shall now take advantage of this investigation, which, illustrated as it is by Mr. Bauer's microscopical drawings, will stand long without a parallel.\n\nAlthough the processes by which the human foetus and that of quadrupeds are formed, differ in many essential particulars from those employed in the bird, some circumstances are common to both; one of these, the mode in which the vesicle bursts the membranes of the yelk is distinctly seen in the embryo in the egg hatched out of the body, and explains what takes place where the embryo is attached to the uterus, which otherwise could not have been ascertained.\n\nIn a former paper, I have shown the formation of the ovum in the corpus luteum; I have traced this ovum into the uterus, where it became concealed in the soft flocculent bed of efflorescent coagulable lymph prepared to receive it. That it is afterwards enveloped in this moss-like covering, has been demonstrated by my revered master in Human Anatomy,\nDr. William Hunter; but in what manner the embryo breaks its amnion, and opens a communication with the uterus, is a question on which Dr. Hunter is silent: indeed it is one that could not be touched upon till it was ascertained that the ovum, when it arrived at the uterus, was completely enclosed in the amnion.\n\nHaving been the first to ascertain that curious fact, and having arrived at that knowledge through the microscopical observations of Mr. Bauer, I am peculiarly gratified, that the same powers, exerted in another correspondent investigation, should have enabled me to give the solution.\n\nIn the ovum of the hen, the rudiments of the embryo require nourishment from one source, aeration from another. In the human ovum one source supplies both; but in either case there is a necessity for a communication between the blood vessels of the embryo and the source of their blood's aeration; and this is effected in exactly the same manner in the human species, the quadruped, and the bird. Out of this the embryo acquires a mode of suspension in the amnion which secures it from injury, both in the bird and quadruped. The mode is as follows: that bag, which is afterwards in the human species and in quadrupeds to become the urinary bladder, is enlarged to a certain size with such rapidity, that it bursts the amnion, which is prepared to be so ruptured, and the arteries lying upon its two sides are carried directly into contact with the chorion, and there the placenta is formed in the open space between the two edges of the chorion. This is exactly similar to the vesicle in the chick bursting the covering of the yelk, and forming the enveloping bag. It is deserving of remark, that in the human ovum, and that of\nquadrupeds, there is a natural opening in the external membrane; in the bird, the natural opening is in the internal one, which in its structure bears a resemblance to the chorion.\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.\n\nPLATE XXXII.\n\nFig. 1.
