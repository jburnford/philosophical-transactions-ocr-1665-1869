An Extract of a Letter
Written by Dr. Edward Brown from Vienna in Austria March
3. 1669. concerning two Parhelia's or Mocksuns, lately seen in
Hungary.

I received the account of the Parhelia's, seen January 30th
last, st.n.about one of the clock in the afternoon, over the City
of Cassovia in Hungary. It was communicated to me from a
Learn'd Jesuit, call'd Father Michel, who lives at Pressburg, but
is now in this City. There were two Parhelia's, one on each
side of the true Sun, and they were so refulgent, that the na-
ked Eye could not bear the brightness thereof. One of them
(the lesser of the two) began to decay before the other, and
then the other grew bigger, and continued well nigh two hours,
projecting very long rays from itself. They were both on that
part, which was towards the Sun, tinged with a pale yellow,
the other parts being somewhat fuscous. There were at the
same time seen several Rainbows, together with the Segment
of a great white Circle, of a long duration, passing through the
two Parhelia's and the Sun: and all this at a time, when the
Air was almost free from Clouds, though here and there were
scatter'd some very thin ones.
