IV. The AMERICAN PHYSITIAN; or a Treatise of Roots, Plants, Trees, Shrubs, Fruit, Herbs, &c. growing in the English Plantations in America: whereunto is annexed a Discourse of the Cacao-nut-Tree, and the use of its Fruit. By W. Hughes. London 1672. in 12°.

Though the Author of this Tract do only promise in the Title of it to give an Account therein of the Vegetables growing in the English Plantations of America; (which is of good use, forasmuch as it may make a part of the Universal History of Nature, now more than ever laboured after by the generous Philosophers of this Age;) yet he indeed performs more: since he presents his Readers with several particulars, that are without the Sphere of the Vegetable Kingdom; such as are the White-Coral-Rocks, to be found upon the Coast of Jamaica, as well as in other parts of America; the Sea-star-Fish; the Alligator; the easy way of making good Salt in Jamaica: For the particulars of all which, we refer to the Book itself.
