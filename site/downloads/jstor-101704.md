Apparuisse in Germania Cometam audivi, mensis Decembris; nusquam tamen ipse conspexi, nec a nostris alicubi visum intellecti.

Hesternà nocte monitu tuo excitus, Carolos infra Procyonem perlustrans,
Nebulosam offendi, latam, & Stellulis confertissimam. Hanc eandem credo,
quam Tu observasti; certior etsi, si quanta ejus fuerit Declinatio vel Altitudo meridiana, indicaveris. Novam etiam in Petiore Coticis sepium ante octo menses vidi, nec minorem quam Tu innis. Sed de Mercurio nihil pronunciare possum, siquidem nullas circa ipsum circumpositas fixas intra tubi capacitatem inventi; & ampliora nondum confecta sunt Instrumenta, quibus ejusdem a Stellis remotioribus distantie rite capi possint. Vale, Vir Clarissime, &c.,
si quas Occultationum futurarum Observationes Cali indulescent, perge, ut capiisti, me earum facere participem. Ego meus vicissim lubentissime semper concedere paratus sum. Grenovici, A. 1676. Martii 4.

I. Ἀρχιμήδους τῆς Συγγραφῆς ὑπομνήματος, ἢ Κύκλων Μάθηματος: Εὔτοιχε Ἀσκαλάντι-
τε εἰς ὁμίλον ἀνδρῶν, &c. Cum Versione & Notis Joh. Wallis SS.Th.
Doct. Geometriae Professoris Saviliani. Oxonii e Theatro Sheldoniano, 1676.

Though this Tract of Archimedes his Arenarius have been formerly twice printed in Greek, and thrice in Latin, yet did the learned Dr. Wallis see cause enough to publish another Edition, therein presenting us with many emendations in the Original, and with a new Version in Latin, and adding some short strictures serving to illustrate the sense thereof. And the Book seemed to deserve these pains, as being not only an elegant and acute piece, worthy of Archimedes, but also an excellent Monument preserving both a piece of remote Antiquity, as is that of Aristarchus Samius his Hypothesis, revived by Copernicus, and that of the Dorick Dialect in Prose. Besides, it exhibits the foundation laid of the Art of Numbering or rather Noting of numbers, now in use amongst us, with Saracenique or rather Indian Cyphers. And it accommodates those numbers \(a, b, c, d, \ldots\) not only to numbers proportional in a duple ratio; but also to any others, in any ratio whatsoever, that are in a continual proportion from the Unite: And they are the same with what is commonly call'd Unit, Root, Quadrat, Cube, Biquadrat, to wit,

\[
\begin{align*}
& a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2, \ldots \\
& a^3, b^3, c^3, d^3, \ldots \\
& a^4, b^4, c^4, d^4, \ldots \\
& a^5, b^5, c^5, d^5, \ldots \\
& a^6, b^6, c^6, d^6, \ldots \\
\end{align*}
\]

As to the argument of the Book, 'tis well enough known to the Curious, that it Geometrically shews a number exceeding that which
which is equal to the number of the Sand, capable to fill up not only
the whole Earth and its cavities, but also the whole World.

To this Tract of the Number of the Sand, is added that other
of the same Archimedes, touching the Dimension of a Circle, because
'tis several times quoted in the former, as the foundation of his Calculus; nor did it want emendation. To it is annexed Eutocius his
short Commentary upon the said Dimension, which exhibits a Specimen of the form and manner, wherein the later Greeks were wont
to write their Comments upon their more ancient Authors; and
shews withal, how laborious it was to make Multiplications, Divisions, and Extractions of roots before the use of the Indian Cyphers
was introduced, as also after what manner they were performed.

II. Observationes Medicae circa MORBORUM ACUTORUM
HISTORIAM ET CURATIONEM; Auth. Thoma Sydenham
M.D. Londini, in 8°.

The Author of this Treatise, aiming principally in his Practice
of Physick to contribute what he can to the real and constant cure
of all Diseases, and being well aware of that great desideratum in
Physick of faithfully recording such Medical Observations and Methods of Cure, as by candid and careful Physicians are made, and
with success employ'd, resolved at length, after many solicitations of
those of his Friends that knew his Practice, and his constant endeavours of improving the same for the common benefit of Mankind, to
publish these his Observations, relating to the History and the
successful and certain Cure of Acute Diseases, waving therein all
Philosophical Hypotheses, and delivering nothing but genuine matter of Fact; distinguishing withal the peculiar and constant Phenomena of Diseases from those accidental and adventitious; and
very carefully observing the aptness of the several Seasons of the
Year to occasion the several sorts of Diseases reigning in them.

Now this History and Cure of Acute Diseases here described,
comprehends his Observations of the fifteen last years of this Age;
a competent time, for rendering an account of the distinct species
of Epidemicals, which not only fortuitously invade us, but are in
one year, or in a certain series of years, of one and the same kind,
and in other years different from one another.

To descend to the particular Matter here performed,
our Author hath observ'd, that from the years 1661 to that
of 1676, there have reigned five several Constitutions of the Air,
Air, which have produced as many species of Epidemical Diseases and Fevers severally named.

Of these he calls the first the Continual Depuratory Fever, lasting from 1661 to 1665, which he esteems to be the principal Fever of Nature, forasmuch as therein she doth so regulate all the Symptoms, as to dispose the Febrile matter, when duly digested and prepared, to be discharged either by a competent sweat or a liberal transpiration. Here he records divers important Observations of his, and notes the several symptoms of the Disease, the Method of cure, and the Diet of his Patient, both during the Disease and after it; concluding this Head with describing the nature, symptoms and cure of the Intermittent Fevers bred in this first Constitution.

The second Epidemical Constitution of another kind he observes to have been in London in the years 1665 and 1666. This kind he calls Inflammatory, of which nature the Plague or Pestilence was in the highest degree, sweeping away, when it was in its height, 8000 in one week, more or less. Here he takes notice, that for rendering a rational account both of such wasting Diseases as this, and of such that are very gentle, it may be supposed, that sometimes the constitution of the body of the Air is such that it breeds Diseases that carry away innumerable People; at other times it afflicts but a very small number of them; though it be yet very obscure to us, wherein that different texture of Air, that hath such different effects, doth consist.

Now of this second sort he very particularly describes also the several symptoms, and the difficulties occurring in respect of those Physicians that advise and use Vena-section in the Plague: Where he relates a strange example of the good success thereof here in England; as also his own use of bleeding in this distemper for a while, together with his reason of desisting from it, and the method by him employ'd afterwards, and the success thereof.

The third Epidemical Constitution, described by him, did obtain in the years 1667, 1668, and part of 1669; and it was that of the Small pox, and of a Variolous Fever, resembling (except the eruption of the pustules) the Small-poxes, in symptoms and duration, and vanishing with the Small-pocks. This was accompanied with a Diarrhoea, especially at the later end of it; & it approached so near the nature of the Small-pocks, that it seem'd to be nothing else,
but the same turn'd inward and incumbent on the visceræ. The
Phænomena, symptoms, and cure of this Fever, and the differ-
ence between the Distinct and the Flex-pox, and the slaughter of
thousands sick of these Pox for want of a due Method in treating
the patients, and many other considerable remarks, are with great
care and skill deliver'd by the Author.

The fourth Epidemical Constitution here discoursed of, was here
in vogue An. 1670, 1671, 1672, and is by our Author call'd the
Dysenteric Fever, accompanied with the Measles, and the Cho-
lera morbus, and followed by a Bilious Colick: All described as to
their effects and method of cure, with the like care and caution,
as the foregoing.

The fifth Constitution that obtained here was An. 1673, 1674,
1675, viz. A Fever of a very Anomalous nature, to which the
Dysentery and Diarrhoea were only symptonical, not essential, and
upon which surven'd Epidemical coughs, with Pleuritis and
Peripneumonia; as these five constitutions were Stationary, so they
had some Intercurrent Fevers, as the Scarlet-feaver, the Bastard
Peripneumonia, the Rheumatisme, the Frysphilus, and the Angina,
which are also accurately described by our Author, both as to their
Phenomena and Cure. See the Author himself both for his Observa-
tions and manner of the Cure.

III. De CONSENSU VET. ET NOVÆ PHILOSOPHÆ
Libri IV, seu Promota per Experimenta Philosophia pars prima:
Authore J. B. Du Hamel P.S.L. & Regiae Scientiarum Academiae
à Secretis, in 12°.

In this second and considerably augmented Edition the worthy
and Learned Author performs four things in so many Books.

In the first, he gives an account of the Principles of the Platonick
Philosophy, and shews the difference between it and the Peripate-
tick; delivering in the same the Natural Theology of the Platonists;
and discoursing fundamentally, from their Principles, of the Exi-
stence of God, and his Providence and Concourse; then of the
Origine as well as the Spirit of the World; not forgetting to shew,
how that Philosophy endeavours to raise the Mind to the consid-
eration of Eternal and Primæval notions, and having diverted it from
immersing itself into unstable and perishable things, converts it to
such as are only perceived by the Intellect; which our Author,
duely pondering the dignity of Humane Nature, esteems to be of
exceeding
exceeding great importance, especially since the world now swarms with those that are so very sensual as to contend, that nothing can be understood but Body.

In the second Book he explains first the Principles of Aristotle, and discourses at large of the nature and origine of Formes; yet without determining here, whether the Forms of living substances or the qualities of Bodies are things different from matter, or not. Next, he treats of the Epicurean Philosophy, as less difficult and more obvious; discoursing of Atoms, their nature and figures of continuity, and the manner of the cohesion of Atoms, as also of vacuity, &c.

Thirdly, he explains the Cartesian Principles; where he hath first a large discourse about the nature of a Physical Body, endeavouring to evince, that the essence of it consists not in a true Dimension, &c. to shew, that the Idea of the three dimensions, (than which Des Cartes contends we can have no other of a Body,) is the Idea only of a Mathematical, not a Physical Body. Secondly, he treats largely of the Nature and Law of Motion. Thirdly, of the Elastique motion, and the causes of that motion, and of the manners in which it is communicated; as also what difference there is in the configuration of the parts in Springy Bodies, from those that have no Spring; inquiring also, in the Appendix to this Treatise, into the efficient causes of Elasticity, concerning which he delivers the sentiment of Mr. Perrault, after he had alleg'd the Materia subtilis of Des-Cartes, and the ignited Atoms, and the Effluvia of Bodies, which as so many wedges do dilate the constricted passages of the inflected Body. As to the opinion of Mr. Perrault, he supposes, that the ambient Air is of two sorts; one thicker, composed of particles of Earth, Water, &c. inspired by us, not pervading glass nor any other solid body; the other, far subtler and more penetrant, intermingled with the thicker, almost after the manner that quick-lime is mixed with sand, both swimming and moving in the ether, and mixed with it as lime is mingled with water. Moreover, that as the thicker Air, which extends itself to some miles, hath its weight, so the more subtile hath a greater weight (many Experiments evincing both.) Now to this subtile Air Mr. Perrault ascribes the Elastique power and other affections, as the firmness and cohesion of Bodies; forasmuch as the corpuscles, which compose every thing, having plain and flat and manifold superficies, cannot
cannot be pull'd asunder, but they must remove the neighbouring parts of the Air from their place, and by doing so somewhat raise the mass of the Air incumbent, they being everywhere pressed from the environing Air, no otherwise than a Body immersed in water is on all sides compressed by water. Wherefore as often as a firm body, e.g. the branch of a tree, is bent, the convex parts thereof are somewhat forced asunder; but when that exterior force ceaseth, than every part recovers its proper figure and scite; and this, he faith, is mainly effected by the weight of the subtler Air, &c.

In the third Book he treats amply of the four Elements, commonly so called, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth: where occur many considerable Observations concerning Fire and Air. The Epicurean notion of Fire is here explained, and the Cartesian likewise; and those particulars discussed, that seem difficult in the latter. There are also recited many phenomena of Flame, and the latent fire in Lime and other Bodies ingeniously discoursed of: Moreover, what is the nature and use of the Air, what the nature of the Ether, together with the many Experiments about the Spring of the Air, made in the Machina Boyliana, in England and elsewhere, &c.

In the fourth are explained the Principles of Chymistry, the mixture and dissolution of Bodies, Fermentation &c. This also is full of new Experiments and Observations, made here and in France, and other Countries. So that there being represented in this new Edition, as in an Epitome, most of the subjects and enquiries of Natural Philosophy, and they treated with much plainness and elegancy, it may be of great use to young Students in Philosophy to instruct themselves in all those matters with brevity and delight.

IV. Of EDUCATION, especially of Young Gentlemen, in two parts, the second impression with Additions; Printed at the Theater Oxon. &c.

That eminently Learned and Famous Knight Sir Henry Wotton, did long since, at the end of his Elements of Architecture, promise, as devoted to the service of his Countrey, a Philosophical Survey of Education which is indeed (says he) a Second Building or Repairing of Nature, and a kind of Moral Architecture. This he promised An. 1624; and he made many Essays, and began some Chapters, but could never bring his design to so much perfection, as could give satisfaction to his own mind and intentions. This our Author
Author, who is pleased to conceal his Name, is very full and punctual, with Instructions proper for all conditions of human life, particularly for the Generous.

The wisest of all Ages have taken care of Education, as fundamental to prosperous Government, and the best & most seasonable help to good Literature. Solomon for the East, and Daniel, had there an extraordinary felicity. Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Isocrates, and the Sententious small Poets, as we call them, are, in their several capacities, for Greece. Cicero and Quintilian, above all others, for sound Wit and Eloquence, and peculiarly for their Orator, which should be their perfect, compleat and honest (that is, in their Style, Honorable) Man among the Romans. And some of the acutest of our Modern have been free of their Advizo's to prompt the Studious: Bodin, for History; Clapmarius in his Nobile Studiorum Triennium. Also Grotius, in one or two sheets; Sturmius, with like brevity; Chr. Colerus De Studio Politico; and Casselius in a touch: Joac. Focani De ratione Studiorum Dissertatio: For choice or variety of Books, Drexelius. And Gabr. Naudai Bibliographia Politica, and his Instructions for erecting a Library, elegantly English'd by Worthy Mr. Evelyn. Many curious French have done well for the main; J. M. argutely in an English sheet, &c.

But this our Author hath reduced the best of Antient and Modern Advizo's into a compact Method, and inter'act'd it with a very great variety of his own seasonable suggestions. I shall give no judgment upon the particulars; and the whole is composed so succinctly, that it needs not nor admits any other brevity. But I dare affirm it, that this Treatise is singularly worthy to be perused by all the Ingenuous, that are or may be concern'd in those Fundamental affairs; as worthy also to come forth from the Famous Theatre of Oxford.

III. Bathoniensium & Aquigranensium THEIR MARUM Comparatio, varia adjunctis illustrata à R. P. Londini, impensis Joh. Martyn, ad insigne Campanae in Cimiterio D. Pauli, 1676. in octavo.

The ingenious comparison that is made in this Tract of these two Baths, regards their Antiquity, Scituation, Structure, Cause of their Heat, Minerals that are their Ingredients, and their Medicinal Virtues; further, their Number, Difference, and Form:
Form: To which is added the diversity of Time, when the waters of these Bathes are to be used; together with the Recreations and Divertisements that occur in both places.

VI. VIRETUM BRITANNICUM, or a Treatise of Cider, and such other Wines and Drinks, as are extracted from all manner of Fruits growing in this Kingdom; with the Method of propagating all sorts of Vinous Fruit-Trees. And a Description of a New invented Ingenio or Mill, for the more expeditious and better making of Cider. Also the method of making Metheglin and Birch-Wine; with Copper-plates: By J. W. Gentleman in octavo.

This is done by the worthy Author of Systema Agriculturae in Fol. who, by the Printer's fault, was omitted Num. 114, p. 322, and only mentioned in the Errata at the end of Numb. 115, though he deserves Recommendations much larger than I am able to give, for his great merits towards the Publick.

Printed by T. R. for John Martyn, Printer to the Royal Society at the Bell in St. Paul's Church-Yard.
