F. R. S.\n\nRead May 15, 1794.\n\nIn the last paper which I communicated to the Royal Society on the doctrine of survivorships, I concluded with observing that, as far as my own judgment could discover, I had then given rules for determining the values of reversions depending upon three lives in every case which admitted of an exact solution, and that the remaining cases, which were nearly equal in number to those I had already investigated, involved a contingency for which it appeared very difficult to find such a general expression as should not render the rules too complicated and laborious. Since that period I have bestowed much time and attention on this subject, and have at length so far succeeded as to give me reason now to hope that it is capable of being entirely exhausted. It is not my present design to enter into the investigation of all the problems which still remain to be solved. I shall here confine myself to a few of the most important, reserving the conclusion of the subject for some future opportunity.\n\nThe contingency to which I have alluded in this and my former paper, as opposing the great difficulty in those problems which I have not yet solved, is that of one life's failing\nafter another in a given time. It becomes necessary, therefore, previous to any other investigation, to deduce a general method of ascertaining such an event, and for this purpose I shall subjoin the following lemma.\n\n**LEMMA.**\n\nTo determine, from any table of observations, the probability that B the elder dies after A the younger of two lives, either in any given number of years, or during the whole continuance of the life of B.\n\n**SOLUTION.**\n\nThis event can take place in the first year only by the extinction of both lives, A having died first; the probability of which will be expressed by the fraction $\\frac{b - m \\cdot a'}{2ab}$. In the second year the probability will be increased; for the event may have taken place, as above mentioned, in the first year, or the lives may have failed in the second year, A having died first; or B may have died in this year, and A in the first year. The expression, therefore, for the second year will be\n\n$$\\frac{b - m \\cdot a'}{2ab} + \\frac{m - n \\cdot a'}{2ab} + \\frac{m - n \\cdot a'}{ab} = \\frac{1}{ab} \\times \\frac{b \\cdot n \\cdot a'}{2} + \\frac{m - n \\cdot a' + a''}{2}.$$ \n\nIn the third year the probability will be still further increased; for, in addition to the foregoing contingencies, the event may have taken place by the extinction of the two lives in the third year, A having died first; or by the extinction of the life of A\n\n* In order to avoid unnecessary repetitions, I have uniformly in this paper preserved the same symbols as in my last paper.—See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXXI. page 247.\nin the first or second years, and of the life of B in the third year. Therefore, the probability for the third year will be expressed by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b-m.a'}{2ab} + \\frac{m-n.a''}{2ab} + \\frac{m-n.a'}{ab} + \\frac{n-o.a''}{2ab} + \\frac{n-o.a'+a''}{ab} = \\frac{1}{ab} \\times \\frac{b-o.a'}{2} + \\frac{m-o.a'+a''}{2} + \\frac{n-o.a'+a''}{2}.\n\\]\n\nBy proceeding in the same manner for the fourth year, the probability will be found\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{ab} \\times \\frac{b-p.a'}{2} + \\frac{m-p.a'+a''}{2} + \\frac{n-p.a''+a'''}{2} + \\frac{o-p.a'''+a'''}{2};\n\\]\n\nand supposing \\(x\\) to denote the difference between the ages of B, and of the oldest person in the table, and \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) respectively the number of persons living at the two last ages in the same table, the whole probability of the elder life's dying after the younger will be\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2ab} \\text{ into } b-z.a' + m-z.a'+a'' + n-z.a''+a''' + o-z.a'''+a'''' \\ldots + y-z.a^{x-1}+a^x.\n\\]\n\nNow, since it is well known that the probability of both lives failing in \\(x\\) years, without any regard to the order of their extinction, is\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{b-z \\times a'+a''+a'''+a'''' \\ldots + a^x}{ab}\n\\]\n\n(or supposing \\(\\pi\\) to be the number of persons living at the end of \\(x\\) years from the age of A)\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{b-z.a-\\pi}{ab},\n\\]\n\nit is evident that, if the foregoing series be subtracted from this fraction, the probability will be obtained of the younger person's dying after the elder in \\(x\\) years. In the first paper which I communicated to the Royal Society on this subject,* I not only described the most concise method of computing a table of the probabilities of survivorship between any two given lives, but computed a comprehensive one for persons of all ages, whose common difference was not less than ten years. As the contingency in this lemma is of considerable\n\n* See Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. p. 335.\nimportance, and the solutions of a great number of problems require that it should be previously ascertained, I have computed a similar table on the present occasion; and it will appear from the following operations that both are formed in nearly the same manner.\n\n| Ages of B. A | Probability of B's dying after A. | Probability of A's dying after B. |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| *95 85      | \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{41 \\times 3}{2} \\] = .0827 | \\[ \\frac{3 \\times 41}{4 \\times 186} = .0827 \\] |\n| 94 84       | \\[ \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{48 \\times 8 + 48 + 41 \\times 3}{2} \\] = .1546 | \\[ \\frac{8 \\times 89}{9 \\times 234} = .1546 \\] |\n| 93 83       | \\[ \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{55 \\times 15 + 55 + 48 \\times 8 + 48 + 41 \\times 3}{2} \\] = .2072 | \\[ \\frac{15 \\times 144}{16 \\times 289} = .2072 \\] |\n| 92 82       | \\[ \\frac{1}{24} \\times \\frac{57 \\times 23 + 57 + 55 \\times 15 + 55 + 48 \\times 8 + 48 + 41 \\times 3}{2} \\] = .2422 | \\[ \\frac{23 \\times 201}{24 \\times 346} = .2422 \\] |\n| 91 81       | \\[ \\frac{1}{34} \\times \\frac{60 \\times 33 + 60 + 57 \\times 23 + 57 + 55 \\times 15 + &c.}{2} \\] = .2696 | \\[ \\frac{33 \\times 961}{34 \\times 406} = .2696 \\] |\n| 90 80       | \\[ \\frac{1}{46} \\times \\frac{63 \\times 45 + 63 + 60 \\times 33 + 60 + 57 \\times 23 + &c.}{2} \\] = .2864 | \\[ \\frac{45 \\times 324}{46 \\times 469} = .2864 \\] |\n| 89 79       | \\[ \\frac{1}{62} \\times \\frac{66 \\times 61 + 65 + 63 \\times 45 + 63 + 60 \\times 33 + &c.}{2} \\] = .2907 | \\[ \\frac{61 \\times 389}{62 \\times 534} = .2907 \\] |\n\nFrom these specimens it will be readily seen, that the probability between two younger lives is derived from that of the two preceding older ones, without any addition of labour; for the sum of all the terms of the series, excepting the two first, is constantly obtained from the foregoing operations. Thus, when the ages of B and A are 92 and 82, the two terms \\[ \\frac{55 + 48 \\times 8}{2} + \\frac{48 + 41 \\times 3}{2} \\] form a part of the preceding series, which expresses the probability between two persons aged 93 and 83.\n\n* This, and all the other computations in this paper, are deduced from the Northampton Table, in Dr. Price's Treatise on Annuities, Vol. II. p. 36. edit. 5th.\nAnd in like manner when their ages are 91 and 81, the three terms $\\frac{57+55 \\times 15}{2} + \\&c.$ form a part of the series which denotes the probability between two persons, aged 92 and 82. By proceeding with these operations, a table may be formed for all lives, whose common difference of age is the same, with little more trouble than in the single case of the two youngest lives. If a table of the probabilities of survivorship be already formed (such as that to which I have referred in my first paper), the operations in the present case may be exceedingly abridged; and it will not perhaps be improper here to explain the manner in which this is effected. By exchanging the symbols $c$, $d$, $e$, &c. in the solution in my first paper, for their equals $m$, $n$, $o$, &c. in the present solution, the series expressing the probability of B’s surviving A will become $= \\frac{1}{ab} \\times \\frac{b \\cdot a'}{2} + \\frac{m \\cdot a' + a''}{2} + \\frac{n \\cdot a'' + a'''}{2} \\ldots \\ldots + \\frac{x \\cdot ax}{2}$, which exceeds the series expressing the probability of B’s dying after A by $\\frac{z}{ab} \\times a' + a'' + a''' \\ldots \\ldots + \\frac{ax}{2}$ (or supposing $z$, as in the Northampton Table, to be = 1) by $\\frac{a-\\pi}{ab}$ nearly. If, therefore, the given probability of B’s surviving A be denoted by $Y$, the probability of B’s dying after A will be $= Y - \\frac{a-\\pi}{ab}$, and the probability of A’s dying after B will be $= \\frac{a-\\pi}{a} - Y$. The following table has been computed in this manner, excepting the first and the two last divisions, where the difference of age between the two lives is 10, 80, and 90 years. In these cases, the probabilities have been deduced from the series in this lemma, and chiefly with the view of proving the accuracy of the table in my first paper. It is\n\nG g 2\nhowever necessary to observe, that in the abovementioned series\n\n$$\\frac{z}{ab} \\times a' + a'' + a''' + \\ldots \\ldots \\frac{a^x}{2},$$\n\nthe last term, $\\left(\\frac{a^x}{2}\\right)$ by supposing\n\nthe whole series $= \\frac{a-\\pi}{ab}$, is taken $= a^x$, and therefore the difference between Y and the probability of B's dying after A, is not exactly expressed above. Regard has been had to this circumstance in the following table, in all cases where the age of the eldest life exceeds 86 years. But under that age it is omitted, as the expression $\\frac{a-\\pi}{ab}$ becomes then true to four places of decimals, and of consequence sufficiently correct for any useful purpose.\nTABLE,\n\nShewing the probability of one life's dying after another.*\n\n| Ten years difference. | Twenty years difference. | Thirty years difference. | Forty years difference. |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Ages.

It may not be improper to add, that both tables, though deduced from the decrements of life at Northampton, may be safely used, even when the values of the life annuities are derived from a different source, as the probabilities they express are very nearly the same, from whatever table of observations they are computed.\n| Ages | Youngest | Eldest | Ages | Youngest | Eldest | Ages | Youngest |

two lives becoming extinct in a given time, both in the case of the elder life's dying after the younger, and of the younger's dying after the elder. When the ages of the two lives are very different, this method (as I have observed in my former paper) must be incorrect. I have taken considerable pains to determine the extent of the inaccuracy, and for this purpose have computed the following table.\n| Age   | True Val. Approx. | True Val. Approx. | True Val.

But the differences would have been the same if his life had been the youngest; only in this case the true values would have varied as much as they do in defect. This is obvious from the nature of the approximation.\n\nShewing the value, at 4 per cent. of £1, payable at the end of a given time, provided the life of B shall have failed after the life of A. \n\nMr. Morgan on Survivorships.\nFrom this table it appears, that the approximations and exact values do not differ much from each other till the last years of B's life, and that the principal inaccuracy in adopting the approximation will arise after the extinction of the life of B, when it becomes necessary to multiply the fraction expressing the probability of his dying after A into the remaining series of the solution. But this perhaps will be better understood from the following problems, and from the computations which are made to prove the correctness of the general rules.\n\n**PROBLEM I.**\n\nTo find the value of an annuity on the life of C after A, on the particular condition that A's life when it fails shall fail before the life of B.\n\n**SOLUTION.**\n\nAs the approximation appears from the preceding table to be always sufficiently correct, except in the two or three last years of B's life, it is evident, that if the fractions which express the probability of B's dying after A in those years, be either confined only to the value of the annuity during that short period, or be not involved at all in the computation, no great inaccuracy will arise from having recourse to the ordinary method of determining that probability, provided the solution be founded on real observations of life, and not on Mr. De Moivre's hypothesis. In the present problem, when C or A is the oldest of the three lives, the abovementioned fractions either never enter into the computation, or are confined to the last years of A's life; and in both cases they are combined.\nwith another contingency, which necessarily renders them of less consequence. The solution, therefore, particularly in the former case, becomes very easy; and even in the latter, by the assistance of the table in my first paper,* it becomes equally simple and correct. But when B is the oldest of the three lives, the above fractions are combined with a series which is often of considerable importance, and consequently the common method of solution fails in this case. Yet even here, being possessed of the table deduced from the foregoing lemma, it is attended with little or no difficulty, and a general rule as short and accurate is obtained as in the other cases. This however will be more satisfactorily proved by the following operations.\n\n1st. Let C be the oldest of the three lives. In the first year the payment of the annuity depends on one or other of two events; either that A and B both die (B having died last), and that C lives, the probability of which event is expressed by $\\frac{a' \\cdot b - m \\cdot d}{2abc}$, or that only A dies, and that B and C both live, which probability is expressed by $\\frac{a'md}{abc}$. The value, therefore, of the annuity for the first year will be $= \\frac{a'bd}{2abcr} + \\frac{a'md}{2abcr}$. In the second year, the payment of the annuity depends nearly on the same events: 1st. that A and B both die in the first or second year (B having died last), and that C lives to the end of this term, which is $= \\frac{e}{c} \\times \\frac{b - n \\cdot a' + a''}{2ab}$; or 2dly, that only A has died before the end of the second year, and that B and C have both lived, which is $= \\frac{ne \\cdot a' + a''}{abc}$. Hence the value of the annuity for the\n\n* Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. p. 337.\nsecond year will be \\( \\frac{be \\cdot a' + a''}{2abc r^2} + \\frac{ne \\cdot a' + a''}{2abc r^2} \\). In the third year, by following the same steps, the value of the annuity will be found \\( \\frac{bf \\cdot a' + a'' + a'''}{2abc r^3} + \\frac{of \\cdot a' + a'' + a'''}{2abc r^3} \\), and in the remaining years of C's life the value of the annuity may be determined in a similar manner. The whole value of the annuity therefore, when C is the oldest of three lives, will be expressed by the two series \\( \\frac{a'd}{2acr} + \\frac{a' + a'' \\cdot e}{2acr^2} + \\frac{a' + a'' + a''' \\cdot f}{2acr^3} + \\&c. \\) and \\( \\frac{a'md}{2abc r} + \\frac{a' + a'' \\cdot ne}{2abc r^2} + \\frac{a' + a'' + a''' \\cdot of}{2abc r^3} + \\&c. \\). The first of these series is \\( \\frac{C - AC}{2} \\), and the second is \\( \\frac{BC - ABC}{2} \\); hence the required value in this case is \\( \\frac{C - AC}{2} + \\frac{BC - ABC}{2} \\).\n\nSecondly. Let A be the oldest of the three lives, and if z denote the number of years between the ages of A and of the last person in the table, C' the value of an annuity on the life of C for z years, and B'C' the same value on the two joint lives of B and C; the value of the annuity for the first z years will evidently in this case be \\( \\frac{C' - AC}{2} + \\frac{B'C' - ABC}{2} \\). At the expiration of this term the life of A is necessarily extinct, and consequently the value of the annuity for the remaining years of C's life (supposing δ, ε, ζ, η, &c. to denote the number of persons living in the table at the end of \\( z + 1 \\), \\( z + 2 \\), \\( z + 3 \\), &c. years, and φ to denote the probability of B's surviving A*)\n\nwill be \\( \\phi \\times \\frac{\\delta}{cr^{z+1}} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{cr^{z+2}} + \\frac{\\zeta}{cr^{z+3}} + \\&c. = \\phi \\cdot C - C' \\).\n\nThe whole value of the annuity therefore, when A is the oldest\n\n* See the table in the LXXVIIIth Vol. of the Phil. Trans. p. 337. N. B. When this table is used in the present and following problems, certainty must be denoted by unity.\nof the three lives, will be \\( \\frac{C' + B'C'}{2} + \\phi \\cdot \\overline{C - C'} - \\frac{AC + ABC}{2} \\).\n\nThirdly. If \\( B \\) be the oldest of the three lives, let \\( x \\) denote the number of years between the ages of \\( B \\) and of the last person in the table, \\( C' \\) the value of an annuity on the life of \\( C \\) for \\( x \\) years, \\( A'C' \\) the same value on the joint lives of \\( A \\) and \\( C \\), and \\( \\pi \\) the probability (found by the table in the foregoing lemma), that \\( B \\) dies after \\( A \\). Then, by proceeding as above, the value of the annuity in this case will be found \\( = \\frac{C - A'C'}{2} + \\pi \\times \\overline{C - C'} + \\frac{BC - ARC}{2} \\ldots Q. E. D.\n\nWhen the lives are all equal, the general rule deduced either from the series or the foregoing expressions becomes \\( = \\frac{C - CCC}{2} \\), which is known to be the exact value in this case from self-evident principles.\n\nAs this method of solution is applicable to a great number of problems, I have thought it necessary to make the following computations, with the view of determining how far it may be depended upon. It is to be observed, that the first series of fractions in the above solution, or \\( \\frac{a' \\cdot b - m \\cdot d}{2abc} + \\frac{a' + d' \\cdot b - n}{2abc^2} + \\ldots \\) &c. should have been (according to the lemma), in order to express the exact value, \\( \\frac{d \\cdot b - m \\cdot d}{2abc} + \\frac{d \\cdot b - n}{2abc^2} + \\ldots \\) &c. and that it is impossible to find a general expression which shall be equal to this latter series and at the same time fit for use. This has rendered it necessary to have recourse to the present approximation. But in the first column of the following examples, each term of this last series has been separately computed, so that by comparing the values in that and the second column an exact idea may be formed of the accuracy of the preceding rules.\n| Ages of | Annuity of £1. |\n|---------|----------------|\n| C. B. A. | True value. | Approximation. |\n| 78 15 75 | - | .138 | - | .146 |\n| 70 20 65 | - | .406 | - | .408 |\n| 81 70 80 | - | .530 | - | .550 |\n| 15 85 10 | - | 13.833 | - | 13.782 |\n| 15 75 15 | - | 11.385 | - | 11.230 |\n| 35 75 15 | - | 8.968 | - | 8.834 |\n| 15 65 20 | - | 8.485 | - | 8.379 |\n| 15 80 70 | - | 9.893 | - | 9.529 |\n| 15 10 85 | - | .647 | - | .698 |\n| 15 15 75 | - | 1.038 | - | 1.193 |\n| 35 15 75 | - | .786 | - | .920 |\n| 15 20 65 | - | 1.769 | - | 1.876 |\n| 15 70 80 | - | 4.307 | - | 4.671 |\n\nFrom these examples it appears, that when C or A is the oldest of the three lives, the approximated and the true values agree sufficiently near for any useful purpose; and that even when B is the oldest, the difference is almost as inconsiderable. It should likewise be observed, that these examples are cases in which the difference is likely to be greatest, and therefore a nearer approximation need not be required. Both Mr. Simpson and myself have given solutions of this problem, and in most of the foregoing examples the values derived from them are more correct than could have been expected; but these solutions being founded on a wrong hypothesis, are not so correct as the present, except when C is the oldest of the\nthree lives, nor are they even more simple, so that it can now be seldom necessary to have recourse to them. Without the assistance of the preceding lemma, and the computations which have been just made, it would not have been possible to have ascertained the degree of accuracy of any approximation; and therefore were no other end answered by them, this of itself would be of sufficient consequence to deserve the time and labour which I have bestowed upon this subject. But it will appear, in the solution of some of the succeeding problems, that the use and application of this lemma, and especially of the table deduced from it, are much more extensive and important.\n\n**PROBLEM II.**\n\nTo find the value of an annuity during the life of C, after the decease of A, provided A should survive B.\n\n**SOLUTION.**\n\nThe payment of this annuity depends only on one contingency; and that is, the extinction of the two lives of A and B before the end of each year (B having died first), and the continuance of the life of C to the end of those respective years. The value therefore of the annuity for the first year will be \\( \\frac{d \\cdot b - m \\cdot a'}{2abc} \\), for the second year \\( \\frac{e \\cdot b - n \\cdot a' + a''}{2abc^2} \\), for the third year \\( \\frac{f \\cdot b - o \\cdot a' + a'' + a'''}{2abc^3} \\), and so on for the remaining years. The value of the annuity (when C is the oldest life) will consequently be expressed by the two series \\( \\frac{da'}{2acr} + \\frac{e \\cdot a' + a''}{2acr^2} + \\)\nMr. Morgan on Survivorships.\n\n\\[ \\frac{f \\cdot a' + a'' + a'''}{2abc^3} + \\text{&c.} \\ldots \\text{and} - \\frac{mda'}{2abcr} - \\frac{ne \\cdot a' + a''}{2abcr^2} - \\frac{of \\cdot a' + a'' + a'''}{2abcr^3} \\]\n\n\\&c. \\(= \\frac{C - AC}{2} - \\frac{BC - ABC}{2}\\). If \\(A\\) be the oldest of the three lives this rule will be insufficient. Let \\(z, C', B'C'\\) and \\(\\phi\\) denote the same quantities as in the second part of the preceding problem; then will the value of the annuity in this case, for the first \\(z\\) years, be \\(= \\frac{C' - AC}{2} - \\frac{B'C' - ABC}{2}\\), and its value for the remaining years of \\(C'\\)’s life \\(= 1 - \\phi \\cdot C - C'\\); for the payment of it during this last term depends on the contingency of \\(C'\\)’s living so long, and of \\(A\\)’s having survived \\(B\\), which probability is \\(= 1 - \\phi\\); therefore the whole value will be \\(= C - \\frac{C' + B'C'}{2} - \\phi \\cdot C - C' - \\frac{AC - ABC}{2}\\).\n\nIf \\(B\\) be the oldest of the three lives, let \\(x, \\pi, C', A'C', \\delta, \\epsilon, \\zeta, \\&c.\\) denote the same quantities as in the third part of the foregoing problem; also let \\(x'\\) denote the sum of the decrements of the life of \\(A\\) for \\(x\\) years, and \\(\\alpha', \\alpha'', \\alpha'''\\), \\&c. the decrements of the same life in the \\(x + 1\\)st, \\(x + 2d, x + 3d, \\&c.\\) years. The value of the annuity for the first \\(x\\) years will it is evident be \\(= \\frac{C' - A'C'}{2} - \\frac{BC - ABC}{2}\\). In the \\(x + 1\\)st year the payment of it will depend on the contingency of \\(A\\)’s having died after \\(B\\) in \\(x + 1\\) years, and \\(C\\)’s having lived to the end of this term. As the life of \\(B\\) becomes necessarily extinct in \\(x\\) years, it is plain that the probability of \\(A\\)’s dying after him in \\(x + 1\\) years must be \\(= \\frac{x' + \\alpha'}{a} - \\pi\\), and therefore that the value of the annuity in this year will be \\(= \\frac{x' + \\alpha'}{a} \\times \\frac{\\delta}{cr^{x+1}} - \\frac{\\pi \\cdot \\delta}{cr^{x+1}}\\). In the same manner the value of the annuity in the \\(x + 2d,\\)\n\nMDCCXCIV.\n$x + 3d$, &c. years will be $= \\frac{x' + a' + a''}{a} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{cr^x + z} - \\frac{\\pi \\cdot \\xi}{cr^x + z} \\ldots \\ldots$\n\n$\\frac{x' + a' + a'' + a'''}{a} \\times \\frac{\\xi}{cr^x + z} - \\frac{\\pi \\cdot \\xi}{cr^x + z} \\ldots \\ldots$ &c. But the series $\\frac{x' + a'}{a} \\times \\frac{\\delta}{cr^x + z}$\n\n$+ \\frac{x' + a' + a''}{a} \\times \\frac{\\varepsilon}{cr^x + z} + \\ldots \\ldots$ &c. is $= C - C' - AC - A'C'$, and\n\nthe series $\\frac{\\pi \\cdot \\delta}{cr^x + z} + \\frac{\\pi \\cdot \\varepsilon}{cr^x + z} + \\ldots \\ldots$ &c. is $= \\pi \\cdot C - C'$, the whole value of the annuity therefore, when B is the eldest, will be $= C - AC - \\frac{C' - A'C'}{2} - BC - ABC - \\pi \\cdot C - C'$.\n\n**COROLLARY.**\n\nIf the solution of either of these two problems be given, the solution of the other problem may be immediately derived from it; for the value of the reversion in one is no more than the difference between the value of the reversion in the other, and the value of an annuity on the life of C after A. In other words, let the value found by either of these problems be called Q, and the required value of the reversion in the other problem, supposing the ages of A, B, and C to be the same in both, will be $= C - AC - Q$. This deduction is self-evident, and if applied to any of the foregoing rules will be found to confirm the truth of the solution.\n\n**PROBLEM III.**\n\nTo find the value of a given sum payable on the death of A and C, provided B should survive one life in particular (A).\nMr. Morgan on Survivorships.\n\nSOLUTION.\n\nIn the first year the payment of the given sum will depend upon either of two events; 1st, that all the three lives shall drop (B having survived A) which is \\( \\frac{b-m \\cdot c-d \\cdot a'}{2abc} \\). 2dly, That B shall live, and only A and C die, which is \\( \\frac{c-d \\cdot ma'}{abc} \\).\n\nThe value therefore of the given sum in the first year will be \\( \\frac{s \\cdot a'}{abcr} \\times \\frac{bc+mc-bd-md}{z} \\). In the second and following years the payment of S will depend upon either of seven events: 1st. that all the three lives drop in the year, B having survived A. 2dly, That B lives, and only A and C die in the year. 3dly, that A dies in the year, C dies in any of the foregoing years, and B lives. 4thly, That B dies after A in the year, and C dies in any of the foregoing years. 5thly, That C dies in the year, and B dies after A in any of the foregoing years. 6thly, That B and C both die in the year, and A dies in any of the foregoing years. And 7thly, That C dies in the year, A in any of the foregoing years, and B lives. From the several fractions expressing these contingencies the value of the given sum will be found \\( \\frac{s}{2ab} \\times \\frac{a'b}{r} + \\frac{a''m}{r^2} + \\frac{a'''n}{r^3} + &c. + \\frac{s}{2ab} \\times \\frac{a'm}{r} + \\frac{a'n}{r^2} + \\frac{a''o}{r^3} + &c. - \\frac{s}{2abc} \\times \\frac{a'bd}{r} + \\frac{a''me}{r^2} + \\frac{a'''nf}{r^3} + &c. - \\frac{s}{2abc} \\times \\frac{a'md}{r} + \\frac{a'ne}{r^2} + \\frac{a''of}{r^3} + &c. + \\frac{s}{2acr} \\times \\frac{a'd}{r} + \\frac{a'+a''e}{r^2} + &c. + \\frac{s}{2abcr} \\times \\frac{a'md}{r} + \\frac{a'+a''ne}{r^2} + &c. - \\frac{s}{2acr} \\times \\frac{a'e}{r} + \\frac{a'+a''f}{r^2} + &c. - \\frac{s}{2abcr} \\times \\frac{a'me}{r} + \\frac{a'+a''nf}{r^2} + &c. = E + \\frac{s}{2r} \\times \\frac{C-CA-r-1}{b} \\).\n\n\\( BC - ABC - \\frac{s \\cdot \\beta}{2b} \\times \\frac{FC-AFC}{b} + \\frac{s \\cdot d}{2cr} \\times \\frac{m \\cdot PT-APF}{b} \\)\nIf \\( A \\) be the oldest of the three lives, let \\( z, C', B'C' \\), and \\( \\phi \\) denote the same quantities as in the second part of prob.

I, be denoted\nby Q, the second will be \\( \\frac{s \\cdot r - 1}{r} \\cdot Q \\). The required value\ntherefore will be \\( E \\cdot \\frac{s \\cdot r - 1}{r} \\cdot Q \\). If the three lives be\nequal, the general theorem will become \\( \\frac{s \\cdot r - 1}{r} \\cdot V - CC\n-C - CCC \\), which may be derived from either of the fore-\ngoing rules, or from the different series given above.\n\n**PROBLEM IV.**\n\nTo find the value of a given sum S, payable on the death\nof A and C, should B die before one life in particular (A).\n\n**SOLUTION.**\n\nThe payment of S in the first year depends on the contingency\nof the three lives having become extinct (A having survived\nB), which is expressed by \\( \\frac{b-m \\cdot c-d \\cdot a'}{2abc} \\), and therefore the va-\nlue of S in this year will be \\( \\frac{s \\cdot a'}{zubcr} \\times bc - mc - bd + ma' \\).\nIn the second and following years the sum S will become pay-\nable if either of five events should take place. 1st, If the\nthree lives should drop in the year (B having died before A).\n2dly, If C should die in any of the preceding years, and A\ndie after B in that particular year. 3dly, If B and C\nshould die in any of the preceding years, and only A die in\nthat year. 4thly, If B should die in any of the preceding\nyears, and A and C both die in that year: and 5thly, If A should die after B in any of the preceding years, and C die in that year. From the different fractions expressing those probabilities, the value of S may be found \\(= \\frac{s}{a} \\times \\frac{d'}{r} + \\frac{d''}{r^2} + \\frac{d'''}{r^3} + &c.\\)\n\n\\[\n+ \\frac{s}{acr} \\times \\frac{d'_m}{r} + \\frac{e \\cdot d' + d''}{r^2} + &c. - \\frac{s}{2ab} \\times \\frac{d'_m}{r} + \\frac{a''n}{r^2} + \\frac{a'''o}{r^3} + &c. +\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{2abc} \\times \\frac{a'_bd}{r} + \\frac{a''me}{r^2} + \\frac{a'''nf}{r^3} + &c. + \\frac{s}{2abc} \\times \\frac{a'_md}{r} + \\frac{a''ne}{r^2} + \\frac{a'''of}{r^3} + &c.,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n- \\frac{s}{2ac} \\times \\frac{da'}{r} + \\frac{e \\cdot d' \\cdot d''}{r^2} + &c. - \\frac{s}{2abc} \\times \\frac{a'_md}{r} + \\frac{a'' + a''' \\cdot ne}{r^2} + &c. +\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{2acr} \\times \\frac{ea'}{r} + \\frac{f \\cdot d' + d''}{r^2} + &c. + \\frac{s}{2abc} \\times \\frac{a'me}{r} + \\frac{a'' + a''' \\cdot nf}{r^2} + &c.\n\\]\n\nThe three first of these series are \\(= \\frac{s \\cdot r^{-1}}{r} \\times V - A - C + AC\\), and the remaining eight denote the value of S by the third problem, with contrary signs. If this last value be called Y, and the value of an annuity of £1. on the longest of the two lives of A and C be called Z, the required value will be \\(= \\frac{s \\cdot r^{-1}}{r} \\times V - Z - Y\\); that is, the value of the given sum in this case is \"the difference between its value after the extinction of the lives of A and C, on the contingency of B's surviving A, and the whole value of the reversion after the death of A and C, without any restriction.\" This rule is self-evident, and proves the truth of the foregoing investigations. The solution of this problem may also be derived from the second problem in this paper, and the third problem in my paper communicated in the year 1788.* In other words, \"the value of S in the present case is equal to the difference between its value after the death of A and B, provided B\n\n* Phil. Trans.

But if the ages of B and C differ much from each other, it is evident that the annuity on the single life of the younger of them (suppose C), and on the joint lives of AC and AT, ought to be continued only for as many years as are equal to the difference between the age of B and of the oldest life in the table of observations. In this case also there is a further value of S, after the necessary extinction of the life of B, arising from the contingency of that life's having failed after the life of A, and of C's having failed after both of them.

A similar result may likewise be immediately obtained from the series themselves; for the value of \\( S \\) for the first year is easily found in this case to be \\( \\frac{s}{r} \\times \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{d}{2c} + \\frac{dd}{2cc} - \\frac{d^3}{6c^3} \\), for the second year \\( = \\frac{s}{r^2} \\times \\frac{ee}{2cc} - \\frac{dd}{2cc} + \\frac{d}{2c} - \\frac{e}{2c} + \\frac{d^3}{2c^3} - \\frac{e^3}{2c^3} \\), for the third year \\( = \\frac{s}{r^3} \\times \\frac{ff}{2cc} - \\frac{ee}{2cc} + \\frac{e}{2c} - \\frac{f}{2c} + \\frac{e^3}{2c^3} - \\frac{f^3}{2c^3} \\), and so on for the other years.\n\nHence the whole value is \\( \\frac{s \\cdot r-1}{6r} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{V-L}}{3c} \\). . . .

When A is the oldest they are \\( \\frac{C'-B'C'-AC+ABC}{2r} + \\frac{d}{2cr} \\times \\frac{AT-ABT-T-B'T}{2} \\).\ntrue values, I have in the following examples undergone the labour of separately computing each of those latter fractions, and the results appear to differ so little from the approximated values, that I think a greater degree of accuracy need not be required.\n\n*Value of £100, payable on the contingency in this problem, computed from the Northampton table, at 4 per cent.*\n\n| Ages of | Value by the rule. | Correct value. | Difference. |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------|-------------|\n| A.      | B.                 | C.             |             |\n| 10      | 85                 | 80             | 1.467       | 1.438       | 0.029       |\n| 15      | 75                 | 73             | 2.233       | 2.150       | 0.083       |\n| 15      | 75                 | 35             | 2.761       | 2.589       | 0.172       |\n| 15      | 75                 | 78             | 1.698       | 1.513       | 0.185       |\n| 20      | 65                 | 64             | 3.031       | 2.912       | 0.119       |\n| 20      | 65                 | 70             | 2.588       | 2.580       | 0.008       |\n| 70      | 80                 | 78             | 9.457       | 9.068       | 0.389       |\n| 70      | 80                 | 35             | 10.109      | 9.618       | 0.491       |\n\nI have chosen those cases in which the approximation was likely to have been most inaccurate; for if the ages of A and B are either both younger, or differ less from each other than they do in these examples, it is obvious that the foregoing rules must be still nearer the truth. I have also uniformly supposed the life of B to be older than that of A, and of consequence the approximated value always errs in excess; if the life of A had been the older of the two, it would have been found to have erred in defect, and nearly to the same amount. But as, in this latter case, the value of the reversion is greater\nthan when B is the older life, the error must necessarily bear a less proportion to the whole value than it does in the preceding examples.\n\nWith regard to the fifth problem, the error in some cases is greater, in others less than in the present problem. If B and C are both older than A it will be nearly twice as great. If one is older and the other younger, it will be altogether inconsiderable; for the fractions which express the probability of the older of B and C dying after A will be as much above the truth, as the other fractions expressing the probability that the younger of these two lives die after A will be below it, and thus the errors of one correct those of the other, and render the computation almost perfectly accurate. I have not given any examples to that problem, not only as the correctness of its rules may be inferred from the examples which have been given to those of the present problem, but as I wished to make as few additions as possible to a paper, which having engaged a large portion of my time and attention for the last three years, has already become too long, and for which my only apology is the attempt to give correct, and not very laborious, solutions to some of the most difficult and complicated cases in the doctrine of survivorships.",
