There was near a week's frost about January the 10th; again about February the 6th; and the sharpest this winter was about the 18th, but none of them lasted a week. It was in general an open, mild, and pleasant winter, and drying, except one great rain and flood, February 23. The NE winds in the middle and latter end of March delayed the grass, but the season was in general calm. It was a fine April, chiefly dry, though with some fine rains at times, and not without some storms. A fruitful season, though in some measure hindered by frequent frosty mornings, for the first three weeks of April: this brought the grain on finely; and the low meadows, which were so thoroughly soaked by the wet last winter, had great crops of grass; but the late laid uplands were thin.\n\nI think it was upon the whole one of the finest summers I have known; a great deal of calm, sunny, and fine weather, and moderately hot. The wet of the winter prevented the ground from burning till the middle of the summer: then a wet middle of July set the grass growing again; but, as rain was wanted, it was not complained of, though in hay-time; for it rather hindered than damaged the hay, which was for the most part pretty well got, though rather troublesome, and the wet made plenty of turnips, and fine eddishes. The harvest was in general well got, with good crops of white corn; but the weather had been full dry for the beans and peas, which were thin, though pretty well corned; and the harvest was early, for it was almost finished in August. The fine harvest made the ground begin to burn again in September; but that was soon stopped, by a great and windy rain before the end of\nthe month. The autumn was fine, with few frosty mornings; yet one or two severe nights in October, before the green-house plants were housed, killed many of them, especially the Geraniums: but it was afterwards warm and wet again, and continued pretty fine, for the season, till the middle of December, when, after some misty weather, followed by very severe frost in the last week, it was exceedingly cold, and the thermometer was one day down at $5\\frac{1}{2}$, which I never saw it at but once before; and the frost continued, though not so severe, till near the middle of January, 1799.",
