Glasses into the Tapers, I found the smallest Prints somewhat larger, but not so clear, so distinct, nor so pleasing to the Eye, as when I use the Empty Tapers. Also I am so confirm'd, that these empty tapers do preserve, strengthen, and in some small degree recover the sight.

* This may give occasion to consider, Whether to a sight much decay'd, a hindrance of the Refractions may be a Remedy? And whether that hindrance of Refractions, which helps some Eyes, helps not others?

And I find myself best at ease with those Leather Tubes, I first used; and rather without any fastening to the bone of the Spectacles: For, as they hang in that slight manner, I can with a touch of my finger raise them up, or bow them down, divide them, or unite to take in the same object, which is more than I said at first. And I put them off and on as speedily and as easily as any other Spectacles.

An Extract of a Letter,

Written from Dantzick to the Honourable R. Boyle, containing the success of some Experiments of Infusing Medicines into humane Veins.

Monsieur Smith, Physician in Ordinary to this City, having liberty granted him to try an Experiment upon some persons desperately infected with the Poxe, then in the publick Hospital here, adventur'd the opening a Veine, and infusing some Medicines into the blood; which was tried upon two persons, whereof the one recover'd, and the other dyed. Yet being since farther encouraged by corresponding with some of the Royal Society in England, about a Moneth since, the said Physician, together with Monsieur Scheffeler, another ancient Practitioner in this City, repeated the Experiment by infusing Altering Medicines into the Veines of the right Armes of three persons: the one, lame of the Goute; the other, extremely Apoplextical; and the third, reduced to extremity by that odd distemper, the Plica Polonica. The Success of this, as Monsieur Hevelius (who was the person only admitted to be present at the operation) informes me, was; That the Gouty man found himself pretty well next day, and shortly after went to work, it being Harvest time, and has
has continued well ever since, leaving the Hospital yesterday, and professing himself cured. The Apoplecticall hath not had one Paroxysme since: And the several Sores, which the Plica Polonica had occasioned, are healed; and both these Persons have been able to work any time these three Weekes. Dated August 18. 1668.

Additional Answers

To the Queries of Mines,

What the Worthy and Learned Mr. Joseph Glanvil intimated in his Answers to the Queries concerning Mines, publish'd Numb.28. p.525. viz. That he did not think himself by the return, then made, absolv'd of his Task, but intended to pursue that matter further, He now proveth to have been his real purpose, by the following Additions, very obligingly imparted by him; concerning the same Mendip-Mines; To which he premiseth this short instructive Letter;

Sir, I now send you a more perfect account of the Mendip-Mines, which by the help of an Ingenious friend I procured from some very experienc'd Mine-men. I have since communicated these Informations to the Gentleman, who gave me the former, which I also sent you; and he assures me, that they are exact. Only in some little things they differ from some circumstances of his; as the Virgula he never knew practis'd; whereas these say, it hath, but is not much valued. For which, allowance must be made to the difference of 30 yeares; it being so long agoe, that my first Informant had to do in those matters. He also saith, that the Trees are sooner wither'd in their leaves upon this Hill; whereas they observe, that when a Mineral-vein runs up into the Roots of Trees, yet they have not noted any difference at Top; which must be understood with respect to other Trees there, into whose roots no such veins ran. I can perceive no difference in the account else, that is any wayes material. What defects you find in it, if you intimate them to me, I shall inquire again for further satisfaction, &c.

To the 10—16 Qu. (Viz. Numb. 19. p.333.) the Grass is rank and good. There are few Trees on this part of the Hill; but the Workmen have known the Vein to run up into the roots of Trees, when they have observ'd no difference at the Top. They esteem the water healthy to drink, and to dress Meat with it.
