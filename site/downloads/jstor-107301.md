XXI. *Eclipses of the Satellites of Jupiter, observed by John Goldingham, Esq. F. R. S. and under his Superintendance, at Madras, in the East Indies.*

Read June 30, 1808.

The following eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, were observed with achromatic telescopes, by Dollond, of three and half feet focal length, and magnifying power between 70 and 80; having been constructed more immediately for this purpose, for which they were exceedingly well calculated in all respects.

An astronomical clock, with gridiron pendulum, and dead beat, regulated by transits of the sun and stars, was used for the time; which was deduced from the transit of the sun nearest the eclipse, and verified by the one immediately preceding or following.

The circumstances under which the eclipses were observed are noted; from these may be inferred, how far the results are to be depended upon: those observed with the "air clear and the planet high," are the most satisfactory and valuable, nothing to the contrary being afterwards expressed.

The longitude of the place, by numerous observations of various descriptions, is $5^\text{h} : 21' : 14''$ or $80^\circ : 18' : 30''$ east of Greenwich: by comparing this with the numbers in the last column, the difference of the tables will be obtained.
The greater number of these eclipses were not visible at Greenwich, but have been found very useful, when correspondent observations have been taken in India.

Persons not much in the habit of observing these eclipses, but desirous of obtaining as much correct information from their observations as possible, may find the following general remarks of use.

A correct difference of longitude, it would appear, is not to be expected, by comparing the time of observation with that in the tables; it therefore becomes necessary to have a correspondent observation to compare with, or some satisfactory observations taken under a known meridian, about the time; from which the errors of the tables may be found. Correspondent observations, should, however, be obtained if possible: but it must not be supposed, that even these will give a correct difference of longitude, unless observed at both places, under the like favourable circumstances, and with telescopes of the same powers.

The air being clear; the planet so high as to be out of the thick atmosphere, and to make the position easy; the telescope sheltered from the wind, and steady; neither moonlight nor twilight, and the satellite not near the body of the planet: An eclipse observed under such circumstances, will, I apprehend, be as perfect as it well can be; and a correspondent observation taken under the like circumstances, will give a correct difference of longitude of the two places, provided the eclipse be observed with telescopes of the same powers.

Taking the eclipses in the following tables, observed under these favourable circumstances as the standard, and comparing their results as given in the last column, with those
of the others, it will be found, how much the latter are affected, by the eclipses having been observed when the atmosphere was hazy, or the planet very low, during twilight, or when the moon was near the planet, or the satellite not far from the body of Jupiter; and that even if correspondent observations had been taken, under favourable circumstances, at a known meridian, the difference of longitude given by the comparison would have been far from correct: the same eclipse observed at two places, under similar unfavourable circumstances, would possibly give a result near the truth; as the observations at both places would be affected in the same way, but probably not in an equal degree, as it is not likely there would be exactly the same degree of haze, the same strength of twilight, &c. &c. at both places; and therefore those observations taken under the same favourable circumstances can only be relied upon with certainty.

It may not be an easy matter to have telescopes at both places of precisely the same powers for these observations: at Madras we had two telescopes in use, constructed at the same time, in appearance precisely alike, and intended by Dollond to have been so in all respects; yet on repeated trials, one was found to have a decided advantage of several seconds over the other, shewing the emersions sooner, and the immersions later by that quantity. In order to do away the error arising from a difference in the powers of telescopes, immersions and emersions should be observed at both places; the difference of longitude will be as much greater than it ought to be by one series as less by the other, but the medium will be the correct difference of longitude of the places: it is possible also there may be some difference in the eyes of
observers, any error which may arise from this source will also be done away by this method.

Hence it would appear, that in order to obtain a correct difference of longitude of two places from correspondent eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, the circumstances at both places should be similar and favourable; and that the telescopes should have equal powers, or that both immersions and emersions should be observed, which indeed ought always to be done, where time will admit: also, that the circumstances being favourable at one place and not so at the other, a result very different from the truth will be obtained.
