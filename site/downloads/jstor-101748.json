  "text": "IV. Longitude found, by Henry Bond Senior, Teacher of the Mathe-\nmatics. London 1676. in 4o.\n\nThe Attempt and Pains of the Author of this Book are certainly\nvery commendable, forasmuch as he endeavours to explain to\nus the Use of the Inclinatory Needle, and in so doing makes it known\nto the world, that, as both the Variation and Inclination of the Needle\nwere found out first of all in this Nation by two Englishmen, Mr. Ro-\nbert Norman and Mr. William Burrows; so he (our Author) hath now\nmade it his business to apply it to an Use, formerly, for ought we\nknow, not thought of, viz. To find the Longitude. Which how he per-\nforms and makes good, is left to the Sagacious Reader to judge.\n\nMean time, the Publisher is desired, here, to take notice of a\nmistake committed in this Book, viz. in the page printed next after\nthe Epistle to the Reader; where 'tis said, that This Treatise hath been\nexamined by six Commissioners appointed by the King, and the Truth of it\naffirmed to his Majesty: Whereas of the six persons there named, the\nRight Honourable the Lord Viscount Brouncker, Chancellor to her\nMajesty, and President to the R. Society, declareth, that he never so\nmuch as saw this Treatise before it was printed, nor was ever present\nat any of the Meetings of the other Commissioners; the Quality of\nthe report of whom concerning this matter the Reader will doubtless\nbe acquainted with in due time.\n\nV. The Royal Almanack: By N. Stephenson, one of his Majesties\nGunners. London 1677. in 12o.\n\nThis Almanack is a very useful Diary of the true places of the\nSun, Moon, and other Planets; their Rising, Southing, and Set-\nting; as also of High-water at London-bridge, with Rules to serve other\nplaces after the New Theory of Tides, and Directions of Sir Jonas\nMoore. To which are added the Eclipses, with a Table of Equations\nfor the regulating curious Pendulum-Clocks, and Movements to the\nSun: Likewise, a Table of the Suns right Ascension in time for every\nday at Noon, and of Thirty of the most notable Fixed Stars: Toget-\nher with the Moons and the other Planets Appulses to the Fixed\nStars, for the Meridian of London, in the year 1677; as also a Transit\nof Mercury under the Sun, calculated for Octob. 28. next. All done\nwith great care and pains at his Majesties command.\n\nErrat. p.766.l.14 & 15.r.icicles; ibid.l.22.r.the Consideration.\n\nImprimatur,\n\nDecemb. 14.\n1676.\n\nB R O U N C K E R, P. R. S.\n\nLondon, Printed for John Martyn, Printer to the R. Society, 1676.",
