Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford, and F. R. S.\n\nRead Dec. 19, 1771.\n\nTHE uncertainty as to the quantity of the Sun's parallax, deduced from the observations of the transit of Venus in 1761 (whether it arose from the unfavourable position of the planet, so that a sufficient difference of time in the total duration of the transit was not, and indeed could not be, obtained from observations made at different places; or from the disagreement of the observations of different astronomers, which were to serve as terms of comparison) seems now to be entirely removed: and from the observations made in distant parts by the astronomers of different nations, and especially from those made under the patronage and direction of this Society, the learned of the present time may congratulate themselves on obtaining as accurate a determination of the Sun's distance, as perhaps the nature of the subject will admit.\nThe two following Tables give not only the observations themselves, but also the computed differences of time from which the parallax was deduced.\n\n**Table I.**\n\n| Places          | Latitude | Observers names | Int.

The point therefore at King George's Island, where the transit was observed, is $9^h\\ 57'\\ 53''$,6 = $149^\\circ\\ 28'\\ 24''$ W. of Greenwich; Vill St. Joseph in California is $7^h\\ 18'\\ 42\\frac{1}{2}''$ = $109^\\circ\\ 40'\\ 37''$ W. of Greenwich; and Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay $6^h\\ 16'\\ 49\\frac{1}{2}''$ = $94^\\circ\\ 12'\\ 22''$ W. of Greenwich.\n\nFrom the near agreement of the several results before found, which are independent of the knowledge of the longitude of each place, and affected only by the necessary error in observing, the accuracy of the observation made at the Cape of Good Hope in 1761, by Messieurs Mason and Dixon, is abundantly confirmed; by comparing which with the\nthe best observations made in the places whose longitudes were very nearly ascertained, the Sun's parallax on the 5th of June was found = $8''$,692 *. And Mr. Pingré, notwithstanding the several arguments very speciously produced in favour of his own observation at the Island of Rodrigues, as represented in his learned Memoire on the Sun's Parallax, will probably be of opinion, that an error of one minute was committed in writing down the time of his observation, as was conjectured by many persons, as well as myself; a mistake to which the most experienced observer is sometimes liable, when at the time of observation the minute is nearly compleated.\n\nThe parallax on the 3d of June being $8''$,65, the mean parallax will be found to be = $8''$,78; and if the semidiameter of the Earth be supposed = 3985 English miles, the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun will be 93,726,900 English miles. And, as the relative distances of the planets are well known, their absolute distances, and consequently the dimensions of the Solar System, will be as follows.\n\n| Relative distance | Absolute distance |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| Mercury,           | 387,10           | 36,281,700       |\n| Venus,             | 723,33           | 67,795,500       |\n| Earth,             | 1000,00          | 93,726,900       |\n| Mars,              | 1523,69          | 142,818,000      |\n| Jupiter,           | 5200,98          | 487,472,000      |\n| Saturn,            | 9540,07          | 894,162,000      |\n\nOxford, Dec. 17, 1771.\n\n* See Phil.
