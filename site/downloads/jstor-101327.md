eodem minorem. Sit A:B::B:D; \(\frac{12}{15} C + \frac{4}{5} B - D\) minor erit quam arcus ABC; differentia autem in semi-circumferentia minor erit quam ipsius \(x^2\), & in quadrante minor quam ipsius \(x^3\). Inter has approximationes sit maxima, penultima sex continue Arithmetice proportionalium, quae minor erit quam arcus, differentia autem, in semi-circumferentia minor erit quam ejusdem \(x^2\), et in quadrante minor quam ejusdem \(x^3\). Sed hæc levia mihi videntur, cum possim Approximationes exhibere, quae ab ipsa semi-circumferentia differant minori intervallo, quàm quælibet ejus pars assignata, neque nobis amplius apparent hæc mirabilia, cum demonstratio solida innotescat. Ad reliqua ab Hugenio publicata, cum à meo instituto sint aliena, nihil dico, nisi quod ipsa Hugenii dicta (non obstante exactissima sua, ut ait, materiae hujus examinatione à me Appendicula factis, ni fallor, longe superentur.

Dein, reflecta lineæ DE parte decima EF, ducas FB, & tandem BG, ipsi perpendiculari: & habebis lineam AG æqualem Arcui ABC, cujus excessus tantillus erit, ut etiam tunc, quando hic arcus æqualis erit semi-circumferentiae Circuli, futura non sit differentia \(x^2\) suæ longitudinis; at quando non est nisi tertiae partis circumferentiae, differentia non erit \(x^3\); et si non sit nisi quartæ partis, non differet nisi \(x^4\) suæ longitudinis.

An Extract

Of the Anatomical Account, written and left by the famous Dr. Harvey, concerning Thomas Parre, who died in London at the Age of 152 years and 9 months.

This Account is annexed to a Book, lately publisht in Latin by Dr. John Betts M.D. one of his Majesties Physicians in Ordinary, and Fellow of the London-Colledge of those of that Profession: In which Treatise (to touch that briefly) the Author endeavors to shew, that Milk, or something Analogous to it,
it, is the universal nourishment of all living Creatures, and the immediate and whole Matter of Blood; whence, and from the three parts whereof, viz., the Butyraceous, Serous, and Gaseous, and their various concoction in the Stomach, and constitution in the Veins, he would deduce the different nature of the Humors and Spirits composing the blood; as from the different Quantity and Quality of these, he would derive the whole business of Health, and Sickness, and the method of Cure.

But as to the Observations made upon the Person, and Dissection of Thom. Parre, 'tis noted,

1. That he was a poor Countryman of Shropshire, whence he was brought up by the Right Honorable Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, and that he dyed, after he had out-lived nine Princes, in the tenth year of the Tenth of them, at the age of 152 Years and 9 Months.

2. That being open'd after his death (viz., An. 1635. Novemb. 16.) his body was found yet very fleshy, his breast hairy, his Genitals unimpaired, serving not a little to confirm the report of his having undergone publick Censures for his incontinency; especially seeing that after that time, viz., at the age 120 years, he married a Widow, who owned, Eum cum ipsa rem habuisse, ut alii mariti solent, & nsque ad 12 annos retroactos solitum cum ea congressum frequentasse. Further, that he had a large Breast, Lungs not fungous, but sticking to his ribs, and distended with much blood; a lividness in his face, as he had a difficulty of breathing a little before his death, and a long-lasting warmth in his Armpits and Breast after it (which sign together with others were so evident in his Body, as they use to be in those, that die by suffocation.) His Heart was great, thick, fibrous, and fat. The blood in the Heart blackish and dilute. The Cartilages of the Sternum not more bony, than in others, but flexible and soft. His Viscera very sound and strong, especially the Stomach; and it was observ'd of him that he used to eat often by night and day, though contented with old Cheese, Milk, coarse Bread, Small Beer, and Whey; and which is more remarkable, that he did eat at Midnight, a little before he died. His Kidneys cover'd with fat, and pretty sound; only in the anterior surface of them there were found some aqueous or ferous (as 'twere) abscesses, whereof one was near the bigness of a Hen-egge, with a yellowish
lowish water in it, having made a roundish cavity, impressed in that kidney: whence some thought it came, that a little before his death a suppression of urine had befallen him; though others were of opinion, that his urine was suppressed upon the regurgitation of all the Serosity into the Lungs. Not the least appearance there was of any Stony matter either in the Kidneys or Bladder. His Bowels were also found, a little whitish without. His Spleen very little, hardly equalling the bigness of one Kidney. In short, all his inward parts appear'd so healthy, that if he had not changed his Diet and Air, he might perhaps have lived a good while longer.

3. The Cause of his death was imputed chiefly to the change of Food and Air; forasmuch as coming out of a clear, thin, and free Air, he came into the thick Air of London, and after a constant, plain, and homely Country-diet, he was taken into a splendid Family, where he fed high, and drunk plentifully of the best wines, whereupon the natural functions of the parts of his body were over-charged, his Lungs obstructed, and the habit of the whole Body quite disorder'd; upon which there could not but soon ensue a dissolution.

4. His Brain was found entire and ferme: And though he had not the use of his Eyes, nor much of his Memory, several years before he died; yet he had his Hearing and Apprehension very well, and was able even to the hundred and thirtieth year of his Age to do any Husbandmans work, even Threshing of Corn.

An Account of two Books,

I. De VIS CERUM STRUCTURA Exercitatio Anatomica MARCELLI MALPIGHII, Philos. & Med. Bonon, &c. Bononiae 1666. in 4°.

A Copy of this Ingenious Book was transmitted by the Author himself to the Publisher, and there being as yet no other Copies of it in England, at least not among Stationers, some Account of the Contents thereof will, 'tis thought, not be unacceptable to the Curious, whilst either more of them be procured out of Italy, or the Book itself be reprinted here; which latter I now find actually a doing in 12. by Mr. John Martyn.

It contains 5. Dissertations: Of the Liver; the Exterior part
