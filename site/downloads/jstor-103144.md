VII. The Dimensions of some Human Bones, of an extraordinary Size, which were dug up near St. Albans in Hertfordshire. Communicated by Mr. W. Cheselden, Surgeon, F.R.S.

The Circumference of the Scull, according to its length, is 26 Inches; and according to its breadth, 23 Inches.

The greatest Diameter of each Os Innomminatum, is 12 Inches.

The Left Os Femoris is 24 Inches long, having only one (and that the great) Trochanter. The Right Os Femoris is 23 Inches long, having three Trochanter Processes.

Each Tibia is 21 Inches long.

If all the Parts bore a due proportion, this Man must have been eight foot high.

These Bones were found near an Urn, inscrib'd Marcus Antoninus, in the Place of the Roman Camp near St. Albans.
